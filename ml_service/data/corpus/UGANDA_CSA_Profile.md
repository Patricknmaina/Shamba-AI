Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) considerations
• Agriculture in Uganda is mainly rain fed and based
on subsistence farming; challenging the sustainability
and food security of farmers, and making the sector
highly vulnerable to weather variability, climate hazards
(particularly droughts) and climate change.
• Crop diversification, small-scale irrigation, permanent
planting basins, green manuring, conservation agriculture
(rotations, intercropping, mulching and reduced tillage)
and agroforestry are among the most common climate-
smart practices being promoted in the country to improve
productivity, food availability and resilience to climate
hazards.
• In livestock production, climate-smart agriculture (CSA)
practices that have been promoted include silvopastoral
systems, adoption of improved breeds, improved feeding
regimes, grazing land management and integration of
biogas. Since, livestock production encompasses the
highest contributor of agricultural greenhouse gases (GHG)
emissions in Uganda, these and other livestock based
practices present good opportunities to reduce agricultural
emissions in the country.
• Efforts to identify and implement system-level CSA
interventions, rather than simply plot level interventions,
have been explored as a means of improving whole farm
climate-smartness; providing an opportunity to address
trade-offs and synergies among CSA practices.
• To support climate change adaptation efforts, the country
has been working towards enhancing the delivery of
meteorological services, particularly in relation to early
warning alerts for climate-related disasters (such as drought

The climate-smart agriculture (CSA) concept reflects an ambition
to improve the integration of agriculture development and climate
responsiveness. It aims to achieve food security and broader
development goals under a changing climate and increasing food
demand. CSA initiatives sustainably increase productivity, enhance
resilience, and reduce/remove greenhouse gases (GHGs), and
require planning to address trade-offs and synergies between these
three pillars: productivity, adaptation, and mitigation [1].
The priorities of different countries and stakeholders are reflected

that address challenges in environmental, social, and economic
dimensions across productive landscapes. While the concept is
new, and still evolving, many of the practices that make up CSA
already exist worldwide and are used by farmers to cope with
various production risks [2]. Mainstreaming CSA requires critical
stocktaking of ongoing and promising practices for the future,
and of institutional and financial enablers for CSA adoption. This

to initiate discussion, both within countries and globally, about entry
points for investing in CSA at scale.
and floods) and capacity building of extension actors on
understanding and disseminating climate information.
• Uganda has made progress on integrating climate change
into national development plans, as well agricultural policies
and programmes. This has included the development of a
National CSA Framework Programme, the launching of
the agriculture sector National Adaptation Plan process,
and the formulation of a national Climate Change Policy.
National and international finance (public and private) as
well as technical support will be crucial in ensuring that
these plans and policies achieve their desired objectives.
• Although there are numerous examples of national and
project finance for agricultural climate change adaptation
and mitigation efforts, financial services and risk transfer
mechanisms are limiting at farmer level, presenting a
significant barrier for CSA adoption. Initiatives such as crop
and livestock index-based insurance have been introduced
aimed at offsetting losses due to climate-related conditions,
and more could be done to scale up access.
• There are numerous organisations undertaking climate-
smart agriculture related projects and programmes in the
country, and the importance of coordination of these actors
through various platforms such as the National Climate-
Smart Agriculture Task Force and the Climate Change
Department has been recognised. Continued financial and
operational support to CSA coordination will be crucial to
ensure complementarity and sustainability of the work of
various actors.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Country Profile
People, agriculture and livelihoods
in Uganda [7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17]
National context
Economic relevance of agriculture
Agriculture is the main economic sector, accounting for 27% of
gross domestic product (GDP) and employing 73% of the labor
force [3]. Since the 1980s, agriculture share to GDP on average
has experienced a slow but almost steady decline from 53.7%
in 1982 to 23.7% in 2015 due to growth in the industrial and
service sectors [4, 5]. Despite this decline, agriculture remains
the key source of exports contributing 46% of total exports. The
country has also made significant progress in relation to women’s
engagement in the agricultural sector in the five domains of
empowerment (5DE): agricultural production, resources, income,
leadership and time [6]. This is evidenced by the steady decline
in the female share of youth illiterate in the population from 58%
in 2010 to 52% in 2015 [7]. Despite their critical and potentially
transformative role in agricultural growth, Ugandan women are
relatively disadvantaged with regards to land ownership and labor
market participation [8]. Women constitute only 16.3% of the total
agricultural landholders [9].
Economic relevance of agriculture
in Uganda [7, 10, 11]
People, agriculture, and livelihoods
Uganda still faces considerable challenges in meeting its poverty
eradication objective of reducing absolute poverty to less than
10% of the population by 2017 [12]. The proportion of the national
population living below the poverty line dropped from 56% in 1992
to about 24.5% in 2013 (7.5 million) [13]. The rural areas account
for 85% of the population and 94.4% of the poor, while the urban
areas account for 15% of the population but only 5.6% of the
poor. In Uganda, agriculture supports the livelihoods of 73% of
the households and provides employment for about 33.8% of the
economically active population, and over 80% of the poorest of
the population [14]. The country’s agriculture is characterized by
smallholder farming with hand hoe as the major production tool
and with landholdings averaging two hectares [6].

Land use in Uganda [7, 10]
Production systems key for food security in Uganda [7]
Land use
Uganda has a total area of 241,550,000 ha. Agricultural land
occupied 11,962,000 ha (60%) of the total area in 1994 and
increased significantly to 14,415,000 ha (72%) in 2013 at an annual
growth rate of 0.3% [3]. Arable land increased from 0.54% annual
growth in 2000 to 2.36% in 2012, while permanent cropland area
decreased from an annual growth rate of 1.69% to 0.72%. Notably
in the last decade, agricultural land has steadily increased at a rate
of 1% per annum, and if this rate continues agricultural land will
account for 90% of Uganda’s land by 2040 [24]. Natural forest
cover has declined drastically from 54% in the 1950s to 20% of the
total area, while grassland has increased by 28.18% during 1996–
2013 [18]. About 41% of the country’s total area is experiencing
degradation, of which 12% is in a severe state of degradation [19].
The most common form of land degradation is soil erosion, found
on around 85% of degraded land [18]. Areas severely affected by
soil erosion (85–90%) include the highlands of Kabale and Kisoro,
while the badly affected ones (75–80%) include Mbale, Rakai and the
cattle corridor districts. Forest cover loss of about 25 million tons
of wood consumed annually translates into 50% degradation of all
tropical high forests on private land and 15% in forest reserves [7].
Agricultural production systems
Agricultural production in Uganda is primarily based on small-
scale subsistence farming (4.0 million households), comprising a
system of mixed agriculture with perennial and annual crops, as
well as grazing throughout most of the districts across ten agro-
ecological zones (AEZs). The AEZs include: the North-eastern dry
lands with an average annual rainfall of 745 mm (where beans,
field peas, groundnuts, passion fruits, simsim and sorghum are
grown); the North-eastern savannah grasslands receiving 1197 mm
(cocoa, millet, tobacco, bee keeping); the North-western Savannah
grasslands receiving a range of 1340 mm – 1371mm (coffee, Irish
potatoes, rice); the Para-savannahs receiving 1259 mm (cassava
fishing, sorghum, peas, tobacco, livestock); the Kyoga plains
receiving 1215 mm - 1328 mm of rainfall (sweet potatoes, dairy); the
Western savannah grasslands (banana, maize, goats); and the Lake
Victoria Crescent, South-western farmlands, Highland ranges, and
Pastoral rangelands with rainfall below 1000 mm and characterized
by short grassland with nomadic extensive pastoralism (pastoral
livestock). However, these systems are dynamic due to climate-
related hazards, high population growth rates of 3.2% per annum,
as well as external political and economic factors [3, 46].
In these zones, agriculture is mainly rainfed; irrigated agriculture
comprises only 0.1% of total cultivated land. The main crops are
cereals (maize, sorghum, millet, rice) on over 1.7 million ha for the
two cropping cycles, or almost 32% of the area cropped in 2008-
2009 [20], root crops (25%), bananas (17%), as well as pulses, oil
seeds, coffee, vegetables and fruits. Export crops include coffee,
tea, tobacco, cotton cut flowers and cocoa. Livestock also is a key
component of the primary sector with over 26 million heads in
2014 [3], not including poultry. Food crop production dominates
the agriculture sector, contributing over 55% of the agricultural GDP,
while cash crops contribute 17% and livestock 15% [21]. Despite
the dominance of food crop production, only one-third is marketed
with exports being less than 7% of food production. Imported food
are mainly wheat and rice, accounting for less than 5% of total food
requirements [2].

in Uganda [7, 9, 10, 16, 25, 26, 27, 28]
Food security and nutrition
According to the Global Hunger Index 2015, a score of 27.6
suggests that Uganda is not yet self-sufficient in food production.
Many households and specific segments of the population suffer
from food insecurity and high levels of malnutrition [23]. The
most food-insecure region of the country is the Northern followed
by the Eastern region with the lowest levels of dietary energy
consumption (1,999 and 2011 kcal/person/day respectively). The
sub-region estimates reveal that 59%, 19% and 11% of households
in the North East, Mid-North and West Nile, respectively, consume
one meal per day. Uganda’s median dietary energy consumption
(DEC) stands at 2160 kcal/person/day in urban areas consuming
slightly more than their rural counter parts at 2156 kcal/person/day
[24]. Uganda’s food security projections indicate that the number
of food-insecure people will grow from 7 million (20%) in 2015
to 30 million (60%) in 2025. Mainly driven by the country’s high
population growth of 3.4% per year in the near term and 3% per
year by 2025 [23].

Greenhouse gas emissions in Uganda [7, 31]
Agricultural greenhouse gas emissions
Uganda has one of the lowest GHG emissions per capita in the
world, estimated at 1.39 tons carbon dioxide equivalent, far below
the global average of approximately 7.99 tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent; yet the country is most vulnerable to global warming
and climate change impacts. Uganda’s contribution to world’s
total GHG emissions is estimated at 0.099%. Between 1990 and
2012, Uganda’s GHG emissions grew 50% with average annual
change of 4% from the agricultural sector [29]. The total national
GHG emissions including land-use change and forestry is about
48.38 Mt CO2e, which is 58.7% of the 82.4 Mt CO2e regional GHG
emissions [30]. The agricultural sector has the highest emissions,
contributing about 46.25% (22.38 Mt CO2e) to the country’s total
GHG emissions [30]. The four main sources of GHG emissions
from the agricultural sector include enteric fermentation at 42.8%,
manure left on the pasture 31.1%, burning savanna 12.9% and
cultivation of organic soils at 4.8% [3]. In spite of these low
emissions rates, the country is highly committed, through its’
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), to contribute to global
efforts to reduce GHG emissions. As a mitigation strategy, Uganda
has then focused on implementing of a series of policies and
measures in the agriculture, energy supply, forestry and wetland
sectors. For instance, strategies to reduce emissions include
protecting the existing forests and implementing the agro-forestry
plan countrywide. Similarly from pastoralism, methane emissions
have been reduced by improving pastoral livestock keeping
practices, such as the use of improved breeds and feeding regimes.
Challenges for the agricultural sector
The underdevelopment of the agricultural sector has been identified
in Uganda Vision 2040, among major bottlenecks constraining
the country’s development. Despite efforts to increase agricultural
productivity, the sector is characterized by low yields. This is partly
a result of poor agricultural technology development. For instance,
despite soil fertility being a key ingredient for improved agricultural
production, the national fertilizer application rate is low at an
average of 1 kg /ha/year, compared to 5kg/ha in Tanzania and 30
kg/ha in Kenya, and far less than the world average of 100kg/ha.
Also the use of improved seeds stands at 6.3% of farmers, while
agro-chemicals are at a meager 3.4% [32].
In Uganda, the challenge of poorly functioning pest, vector and
disease control is a major cause of losses in the agriculture sector.
For instance, the 2008 Livestock Census revealed that each
Ugandan livestock farmer may be losing a startling USD 155 a
year due to disease. In the crop sub-sector for instance, coffee wilt
disease, which started in 1993, has destroyed about 56% or 160
million of the old Robusta trees, equivalent to some 1.5 million bags
or about USD 170 million [21]. This inability to control endemic
disease outbreaks means that Uganda fails to meet international
trade standards and so loses many market opportunities.
Widespread degradation of land resources is another challenge in
Uganda. In 1991, studies estimated that soil erosion accounted
for over 80% of the annual cost of environmental degradation
equivalent to USD 300 million per year [18]. In 2003, the annual
cost of soil nutrient loss due primarily to erosion was estimated
at about USD 625 million per year. Productivity losses per year for
maize from soil erosion have been estimated in some places as high
as 190 kg/ha [21]. The degradation of land resources, while having
a large impact on agricultural production and productivity, also
reduces the ability to sequester carbon and contribute to mitigation
of agriculture and land use related greenhouse gas emissions.
Uganda is faced with market and value addition constraints for
agricultural products. For instance, the proportion of Uganda’s
agricultural commodities and products processed is less than 5%
of products produced [21]. The sector also has poorly functioning
regulatory services, inputs market and distribution systems. For
instance, the quality of seed in the market may be unknown as
quality cannot be determined through visual inspection.
The sector is also faced with constraints related to the enabling
environment for improving agricultural production and productivity,
such as an uncertain policy environment, poor agricultural
technology delivery and adoption, lack of capacity for policymaking­
and planning, lack of capacity for climate change analysis and
decision making and low productivity of sector personnel. Given
the heavy dependence on agriculture, the effects of climate change
could clearly put millions of people at greater risk of poverty and
hunger.
The sector is also faced with institutional development constraints,
such as a weak institutional framework and lack of capacity to
implement the sector development plans, geographically fractured
state of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries
(MAAIF) and its agencies, and low productivity of sector personnel to
ensure efficient and effective delivery of sector goals and objectives.
Agriculture and climate change

temperatures throughout the year, with mean daily temperatures

Climate-Smart Agriculture Country Profile
Projected changes in temperature and precipitation in Uganda by 2050 [40, 41, 42]
Average temperature (°C)
of 28 °C [33, 34]. The long-term mean near-surface temperature is
around 21 °C, with the average monthly temperatures ranging from
a minimum of 15 °C in July to a maximum of 30 °C in February.
The highest temperatures are observed in the North, especially in
the North-East, while lower temperatures occur in the South. A
significant warming has been measured in Uganda for instance,
the Uganda’s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA)
cites an average temperature increase of 0.28 °C per decade in
the country between 1960 and 2010, being January and February
the most affected by this warming trend, averaging an increase
of 0.37 °C per decade. The frequency of hot days in the country
has increased significantly, while the frequency of cold days has
decreased [35, 36].
The annual rainfall totals vary from 500 mm to 2800 mm; mean
annual rainfall ranges between less than 900 mm in the driest
districts to an average of above 1,200 mm per year in the wettest
districts located within the Lake Victoria Basin, eastern and the
north-western parts of Uganda (37, 38). This climate is bimodal
in the south to central parts of Uganda, exhibiting two rainy
seasons (March–June and October–January), with the exception
of the northern-easterly region, which experiences one long rainy
season [37]. Floods and droughts are the most frequent climate
hazards. For instance, the cattle corridor, which is located in the
dry-land region, is prone to drought, while the northern region
is especially vulnerable to both floods and droughts [39]. While
trends are uncertain and data remain limited, the main climate
change impacts expected to affect agriculture in Uganda in the
future include higher temperatures, more erratic and heavy rainfall,
changes in the timing and distribution of rainfall, and an increase
in the frequency and duration of droughts. For instance, the FAO
Crop Water Assessment (FAO-CROPWAT) indicated up to 46%
reductions in optimal banana yields due to soil moisture deficits
within banana plantations.
Climate projections for the country based on the same models
used in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate the possibility of an
increase in the country’s near-surface temperature in the order
of +2 °C in the next 50 years, and +2.5 °C in the next 80 years
using Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenarios.
Whereas for RCP 8.5 the projected temperature increases are in
the order of +2.5 °C in the next 50 years, and +4.5 °C in the
next 80 years. They also predict a slight decrease in total annual
rainfall in most of the country, with slightly wetter conditions
over the west and north-west under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5
scenarios. Rainfall totals might drop significantly over Lake Victoria
(-20% from present) [44]. Overall, Uganda is highly vulnerable to
climate change and weather variability; the country already being
susceptible to unreliable rainfall, frequent drought, periodic floods
and seasonal bush fires

CSA technologies and practices
CSA technologies and practices present opportunities for
addressing climate change challenges, as well as for economic
growth and development of the agriculture sector. For this profile,
practices are considered CSA if they enhance food security as well
as at least one of the other objectives of CSA (adaptation and/or
mitigation). Hundreds of technologies and approaches around the
world fall under the heading of CSA.
A range of CSA technologies are being promoted and implemented
across farmer typologies and agro-ecological zones in Uganda.
Notable practices include integrated soil fertility management,
agro-forestry, crop diversification, conservation agriculture (crop
rotation, mulching, use of green cover crops and minimum
tillage), intercropping coffee-banana and legumes with other
crops, seasonally adapted planting times and effective field water
management in rice production. Under livestock management,
the existing practices include; improved silvopastoral systems (i.e.
converting degraded extensive, treeless pastures into a richer and
more productive environment, where trees and shrubs are planted
interspersed among fodder crops such as grasses and leguminous
herbs), rotational grazing and forage conservation (silage). Use
of livestock dung for household biogas production has also
been promoted and practiced, particularly in intensive livestock
areas with benefits not only for climate change mitigation, forest
conservation and energy provision but also in terms of reducing
the workload and improving the health of women and children.
The bio-slurry removed from the digester can also be used as
organic fertilizer to improve crop productivity. The predominant
users of CSA practices are small-scale farmers whose primary goal
is to increase crop productivity. This corroborates with evidence
indicating that resource-poor farmers are risk evaders by nature,
who habitually seek for solutions to problems through innovation.
Off-farm CSA related services include crop weather index based
insurance, using automated weather stations to monitor specific
parameters and triggers. Strengthening climate information and
early warning systems has also been a focus of various actors
and has been highlighted in various national documents such as
Uganda’s NAPA of 2007.
In this context, CSA is not a novel approach per se, but rather
a compendium of indigenous solutions developed over time by
smallholders to sustainably maximize crop production amidst
diminishing farm size, pest and disease pressure and soil fertility
decline. Nevertheless, adoption of many CSA practices remains
generally low (30%) because of policy gaps. Other constraints
to CSA adoption include limited extension services, inadequate
knowledge, inadequate technology, labor and capital, inaccessible
input markets and declining farm size.
The following graphics present a selection of CSA practices with
high climate smartness scores according to expert evaluations.
The average climate smartness score is calculated based on the
individual scores of the practices on eight climate smartness
dimensions that relate to the CSA pillars: yield (productivity);
income, water, soil, risks (adaptation); energy, carbon and nitrogen
(mitigation). A practice can have a negative / positive / zero impact
on a selected CSA indicator, with 10 (+/-) indicating a 100%
change (positive/ negative) and 0 indicating no change. Practices
in the graphics have been selected for each production system
key for food security identified in the study. A detailed explanation
of the methodology and a more comprehensive list of practices
analyzed for Uganda can be found in Annexes 3 and 4, respectively.
Farmers’ level of adoption of practices with high climate smartness
has been generally low as most farmers still depend on the
traditional subsistence farming systems [21]. However, the Uganda
Vision 2040 (2013) recognizes the critical issues addressed by
CSA technologies, which are aimed at boosting resilience to harsh
climatic conditions. Investment in research towards improved pest-
and disease-free seeds and varieties has been promoted by both
government agencies such as the National Agricultural Research
Organization (NARO) and international organizations such as the
International Institute of Tropical Agricultural (IITA) [43].

Case study: Inclusive stakeholder planning through learning alliances
The Policy Action for Climate Change Adaptation (PACCA) project aims to provide a deeper understanding of how
to approach CSA interventions at a systemic rather than at a plot level. Working closely with both local and national
stakeholders, IITA and other partners on the PACCA project developed a framework for vertically and horizontally
integrating CSA interventions through inclusive stakeholder engagements. Learning alliances (LAs) are multi-
stakeholder spaces established at national and district levels, with the aim of promoting science-policy dialogue,
climate change capacity enhancement, and building synergies to develop solutions to problems that cannot be
solved individually.
LAs encourage consolidated efforts to tackle climate-change-related issues that no single institution would
accomplish on its own. For example, civil society organizations within the LA supported the scenario-guided review
of the Agriculture Sector Strategic Plan, which was important for mainstreaming climate change in the plan. LA also
contributed finances to support activities that led to COP21, which enabled LA representatives to participate in the
development of Uganda’s position in the COP21 climate change negotiations in Paris, France. In addition, LAs have
provided an opportunity to harmonize and coordinate climate change work done by different organizations, often
with duplication of mandates.
Within the framework of the PACCA project, national policy dialogues are informed by district level evidence and
climate change scenarios. For instance, the National Climate Change Policy requires that the district focal point
ensures that climate change actions and plans by district stakeholders are captured in the District Development
Plans (DDP). However, there has been a missing link between policy makers, implementers, scientists and other
stakeholders, which has underscored the role of LAs in connecting the concerned parties. To aid these linkages, the
PACCA project partnered with four Local Governments (Rakai, Luwero, Nwoya and Mbale) to identify the key local
actors to involve in the district planning process. During planning, stakeholders were supported to identify distinct
zones for implementation of locally prioritized and appropriate climate-smart agricultural practices. As a result the
district technical planning committees have been able to prioritize relevant practices in their respective DDPs; actions
that are key for supporting the scaling-up of climate-smart agriculture.

Uganda
Institutions and policies for CSA
Climate change impacts in Uganda require joint management
efforts of all stakeholders from public, private sectors, civil society
and communities. The climate-change-related institutional
framework in the country can be classified at three levels with
climate-related activities as a secondary objective. The first
level involves government institutions that are responsible for
the implementation of the policies and actions set out by the
government; the second level involves development partners who
provide funds to implement programs; and the third level involves
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and communities that
participate in the implementation of projects and programs.
The government institutions that work on CSA-related activities
include MAAIF, which plays a leading role in developing and
promoting climate change policies. Other government ministries
also linked to mainstreaming of climate change adaptation and
mitigation strategies into national policy frameworks include
the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development
(MoFPED) and the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE),
among others. The Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) is
the climate change focal point and liaises climate change issues
with the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as well as coordinating with other
government, development partners, other UN institutions and
NGOs.
Various national institutions are contributing to different CSA
pillars by strengthening farmer capacity to manage climate risks,
developing context-suitable agricultural practices, and sustainable
value chains. These are mainly departments in ministries such as
the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO), which is
the country’s leading agriculture research organization facilitating
the adoption of CSA practices, Makerere University Center for
Climate Change Research and Innovations (MUCCRI) a hub of
academic, professional development, and research excellence
in climate science, climate adaptation and related disciplines;
the Climate Change Department (CCD), established in 2008
to strengthen Uganda’s implementation of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the
Kyoto Protocol (KP).
Development partners provide funding of various projects that,
on one hand, influence economic and social development and,
on the other hand, also address climate change. A wide range of
projects across the country focus on enhancing the livelihoods of
smallholder farmers and, because of the strong linkages between
CSA and food security, many of these initiatives encompass
climate risk management practices to some degree. For instance,
the USAID Feed the Future “Enhancing Climate Resilience for
Agricultural Livelihoods” Project, working with farmers to develop
site-specific climate-smart adaptation practices for banana, coffee,
maize, bean systems in both high and low land areas.
Faith-based organizations are also involved in CSA promotion,
for example through the Farming Gods Way and Islamic Farming
principles that mostly promote conservation agriculture. These
are undertaken by organisations such as Uganda Faiths Network
on Environment Action (UFNEA) who play a crucial role in
climate-smart agriculture training and awareness raising. Private
organisations involved in climate-smart agriculture training and
awareness include Rural Enterprises development services (REDS)
Uganda, who have been supporting conservation agriculture
training, awareness raising and equipment access through the
Conservation Agriculture Regional Programme (CARP), which is
funded by the Norwegian Government.
Given the variety of organizations involved in agricultural climate
change adaptation and mitigation related work in Uganda,
coordination is therefore a key and important aspect of the
countries efforts to tackle climate change. A positive development
on the partnership and coordination front is the formation of a
Climate-Smart Agriculture Task Force comprised of various
key stakeholders on CSA and chaired by the Sustainable Land
Management (SLM) Unit of MAAIF. Within this platform, have
been the organization of various awareness raising and advocacy
events for example the holding of the Uganda National Agricultural
Show of 2015 with the theme “Climate-Smart Agriculture for
Sustainable Food Security and Wealth Creation”. The platform
has also been a basis for discussion of key issues related to CSA
scaling and improved coordination in the country. In addition,
MWE has developed guidelines for integrating climate change into
government institutions.  The National Planning Authority (NPA)
has re-enforced this call by requesting government institutions to
factor climate change into the development plans, and the Ministry
of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED)
is expected to respond to this call by making explicit financial
provisions in budget allocation of departments and ministries. At
the same time, there is still need for greater capacity building of
all institutions (government, international, private and civil society)
on climate change adaptation and mitigation and how to integrate
this into their daily work.
Farmer’ organizations such as the Uganda National Farmers
Federation (UNFFe) and various smallholder coffee cooperatives
are also involved in CSA promotion mostly through advocating
for agroforestry, irrigation and intercropping. Private sector
organisations such as Rural Enterprise Development Services
(REDS) are involved in supporting farmers to implement
conservation agriculture, although this work is also donor funded.
The following graphic highlights key institutions whose main
activities relate to one, two or three CSA pillars (adaptation,
productivity and mitigation). More information on the methodology
and results from interviews, surveys and expert consultations is
available in Annexes 5 and 6.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Country Profile
Institutions for CSA in Uganda
Having ratified the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol agreements,
Uganda’s approach to climate change is highly linked to its
international engagement with climate change politics. Uganda
submitted its First National Communication to UNFCCC in 2002
and it’s Second National Communication in 2014. The country
also submitted its National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA)
to the UNFCCC in 2007 and the (Intended) Nationally Determined
Contribution ((I)NDC) in 2015. The (I)NDC prioritises agriculture as
an adaptation area and specifically mentions expansion of climate-
smart agriculture along with crop and livestock diversification and
climate information as key areas for action. While not explicitly
including agriculture among the mitigation focus areas, many
of the priority actions for agricultural adaptation will also have
mitigation co-benefits. Uganda has also launched a process
for developing its National Adaptation Plan (NAP), and this was
followed in 2016 by the launch of an FAO and UNDP project to
support eight developing countries (including Uganda) to integrate
agriculture into their National Adaptation Plans. The project is
funded through the International Climate Initiative (ICI) and aims
to increase collaboration between agriculture, environment,
planning and finance ministries as well as developing national
capacity for mainstreaming climate into planning and budgeting,
improving economic valuation and conducting impact assessment
of agricultural adaptation initiatives.
Uganda has also made efforts to domesticate other international
instruments and agreements related to climate, agriculture and the
environment such as the United Nations Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD); and the United Nations Convention to Combat
Desertification (UNCCD). The CBD having been domesticated
through formulation of a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action
Plan (NBSAPII, 2015-2025) which highlights the need to address
climate change as a key emerging issue.
Although not specifically targeting climate change issues, some
of the countries environment and forestry related legislation can
be said to have indirectly addressed climate change issues. Such
legislation included the following:
•
The National Forest Policy (NFP) of 2001 whose goal was to
achieve “an integrated forest sector that achieves sustainable
increases in the economic, social and environmental benefits
from forests and trees by all the people of Uganda, especially
the poor and vulnerable related legislation.
•
The National Environment Management Policy (1994, and
currently under review) whose overall goal is “sustainable
development which maintains and promotes environmental
quality and resource productivity for socio-economic
transformation” and includes activities related to payment
for ecosystem services (PES), sustainable land management
(SLM) and specifically mentions climate-smart agriculture as
a key area of focus.
However, until 2007, Uganda’s climate change policy discourse
was generally underdeveloped. To cope with the challenges of
economic development, poverty, food security and climate change,
various climate change specific policy instruments have since
been adopted. For instance, the National Development Plan (NDP,
2010) was the first macro-policy planning document to provide
for specific policy objectives, strategies and intervention actions
on climate change. Since the NDP was launched in 2010, the
government has formulated relevant national policy instruments,
namely, the National Policy on Climate Change, Uganda Vision
2040 and the Agriculture Sector Strategic Plan (ASSP) 2015/16-
2019/20 and the National CSA Framework Programme. It is
under the ASSP that climate-smart agriculture issues are directly
addressed under the national policy framework. As of 2016,
Uganda through support from various partners has committed
to ensure that the second national development Plan (NDPII,
2016-2020) takes climate change into consideration.  In 2015 for
example, FAO assisted the Government of Uganda in conducting
a study aimed at supporting the mainstreaming of climate change
into the Second National Development Plan.
Regionally, being part of the East African Community, Uganda
is subject to the East African Community Climate Change Policy
(EACCCP), which aims to strengthen meteorological services and
improve early-warning systems; increase preparedness for disaster
risk management; and scale up efficient use of water and energy
resources, irrigation, crop and livestock production among others.

17
Uganda
Policies for CSA in Uganda
Climate change in Uganda is a fundamentally multi-sectoral issue,
hence a proactive approach in mainstreaming climate change
into its development policies and strategies has been taken.
For instance, the National Climate Change Policy developed a
framework for the harmonization and coordination of the various
sectoral efforts already underway and to be put forth in the future,
with adequate attention paid to capacity building requirements
and development of financial mechanisms and tools required to
respond to climate change  challenges along these policy directions
at the national level. So far priorities in the National Climate Change
Policy have been integrated in the Second National Development
Plan (NDP II) 2015-2020. In addition in January 2016, the Ministry
of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) validated
Climate Change Mainstreaming Guidelines for the Agricultural
Sector. In the long term, Uganda has the overarching objective
of ensuring that all stakeholders address climate change impacts
and their causes through appropriate measures, while promoting
sustainable development and green growth.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Country Profile
Financing opportunities for CSA in Uganda
Financing CSA
In Uganda, climate change strategic interventions have, to some
extent, been addressed through existing development interventions
with funding from the government and development partners.
The funding sources include public, international, bilateral and
multilateral donors and private sector finance. Public finance to
climate change actions is through the national budget and, as
such, spending is closely aligned with national policy setting and
domestic institutional arrangements. Since national expenditure
is managed on the basis of an individual ministry or another
institution, rather than by sector, ministries and agencies most
likely to be active in the identified policy areas were considered.
In addition to ministry-level expenditure, relevant spending is
channeled through agencies under the relevant ministries [45].
National private sector finance includes two categories of funders:
the public-private and private funders. These funders include
commercial banks, Uganda Breweries Limited, Sugar Factories
and Eco-fuel Africa Limited. Whereas under the public-private
funded schemes, we have: Oil Palm Uganda Limited (OPUL),
Kimba Rice Scheme, and Youth Livelihood Fund by MoFPED in
collaboration with various banks.
Financial support is also provided by international development
partners through bilateral and multilateral agreements, and
private sector philanthropy. Meanwhile, private sector philanthropy
initiatives funding multi-sector CSA activities include Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation, Gatsby Charitable Trust, Rockefeller
Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, McKnight Foundation,
Oxfam International, Conservation International and Clinton
Foundation.
Potential finance
Uganda prioritizes reducing vulnerability of its population,
environment and economy by implementing adaptation and
resilience building actions. A recent emphasis has been placed
on supporting climate-smart agriculture scaling in the country
and hence the need to attract and direct funding towards this area
of work. Funding for climate-smart agriculture has been largely
dependent on short term programmes whose impact on long term
resilience is sometimes not apparent. Government has however
continued to lobby for long-term adaptation financing from the
international community as well as trying to ensure local budgetary
allocation for climate change adaptation initiatives. So far it is
expected that 70 percent of the cost implementation strategy for the
National Climate Change Policy will be raised from donors. Locally,
Uganda finances climate related activities through collaboration
and engagement with traditional development partners such as
the European Union. For instance, there have been seventeen
major adaptation projects implemented in partnership with the
government since 2001, at a value of approximately US$ 59
million. An example of such a CSA related project in Uganda is the
€11 million Global Climate Change Alliance Project jointly funded
by the Government of Belgium and the European Union and
whose project components include improving water access for
cattle, supporting climate focused farmer field schools for coffee
farmers, and the promotion of sustainable commercial-scale tree
plantations for the production of fuelwood and charcoal.
For mitigation, Uganda intends to meet its commitments
partially through the use of international market mechanisms
where appropriate, building upon the experience of the Clean

19
Uganda
Development Mechanism and other existing market mechanisms
[44]. An example of a CDM project in Uganda is the Uganda Nile
Basin Reforestation Project which is funded by partners such as
The World Bank, The BioCarbon Fund, and various developing
country governments. The project involved establishment of
timber plantations and community forestry, and was expected to
generate certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) and cumulatively
capture emissions of 50,000 tCO2 a year. This project, launched
in 2009, made Uganda the first country in Africa to undertake a
reforestation project in the context of the Kyoto Protocol.
The NBSAPII, also highlights the need for generating climate
finance through carbon credit programmes and projects related
to land restoration and protection, but more needs to be said
about the linkages of such projects with agriculture. Other
potential opportunities for attracting CSA related finance include
the existence of the National CSA Framework Programme whose
vision is a “climate-resilient and low-carbon agricultural and food
system contributing to increased food security, wealth creation
and sustainable economic growth in line with the National Vision
2040”; as well the efforts made in 2015 to integrate climate-smart
agriculture into the Agriculture Sector Development Strategy and
Investment Plan (DSIP). These represent strategic opportunities
for the Government of Uganda to allocate funds to climate-smart
agriculture from within the national budget and use these as
a catalyst of larger private and international agricultural climate
change adaptation and mitigation related finance. Although the
DSIP has now been replaced by the ASSP, the same considerations
are likely to still hold. The screening of the DSIP indicated that it
was most responsive to slow-onset climate change and thus greater
effort could be made to ensure the inclusion of more activities and/
or budget for activities aimed at responding to extreme events as
well as contributing to climate change mitigation [47].
The graphic highlights existing and potential financing opportunities
for CSA in Uganda. The methodology and a more detailed list of
funds can be found in Annex 7.
Outlook
In Uganda, climate change impacts are expected to be felt greatly
on the agriculture sector, which is a key sector of the economy as
well as a key livelihood and employment source for the majority of
the country’s people. In line with this The Government of Uganda
has developed various initiatives to address climate change in the
agriculture including through mainstreaming of climate change
into agricultural policies and programmes as well as in national
development plans. More needs to be done to monitor the impact
of such initiatives on the long term resilience and productivity of
the agriculture sector as well as on its contribution to greenhouse
gas emissions reductions.
CSA actions are context-specific and depend on local priorities.
In Uganda, system-level CSA practices such as agroforestry,
water harvesting, conservation agriculture or silvo-pastoralism
have the potential to increase whole farm performance, while at
the same time improving livelihoods and reducing greenhouse
gas emissions. Integration of practices such as biogas into such
systems can provide added benefits and advantages in terms of
use of bio slurry as fertiliser, provision of household energy and
reduction in methane emissions. In order to make informed CSA
investment decisions, effective targeting and prioritization for
these CSA practices needs to be undertaken, and implementation
supported by robust agro-advisory services and a private sector
that is aware of the costs and benefits of investment in identified
priority areas. Although private sector is an important stakeholder
for scaling up CSA, more needs to be done to involve private
sector organisations in the design, implementation and support
of CSA programmes particularly through micro insurance and
microfinance as well development of CSA-related input and output
markets.
The long term success of current efforts to promote CSA will
largely depend on the availability and sustainability of financing.
Numerous funding opportunities exist, however much of the
funding has been for short periods (two to five years). Long term
funding instruments are needed from national to local levels to
allow participating farmers to grasp the concepts fully and realize
the benefits of these interventions, thus catalyzing further uptake
and investment by other farmers and stakeholders.
While efforts have been made to improve coordination of
organizations working on agricultural climate change adaptation
in the country, there is still need to strengthen the financial and
operational capacity of institutions such as the Climate Change
Department of MWE and the Climate-Smart Agriculture Task
Force so they can perform their coordination function adequately.
Improvement of institutional coordination is still needed for inter-
ministerial and local governments, and to enhance partnerships
with private sector, civil society organizations and development
agencies.
Improving and gearing the national agricultural extension system
and ensuring its staff have adequate capacity on issues of climate
change and in particular climate-smart agriculture, will be a key
action area. Along with this, ensuring adequate and timely access
to weather and climate information for smallholder farmers will be
crucial and this will also require good linkages between the Uganda
National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) and various extension
service providers (government, private and civil society).

This publication is a product of the collaborative effort between the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)
– lead Center of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) – and the
Bureau for Food Security, United States Agency for International Development (BFS/USAID) to identify country-specific
baselines on CSA in Africa (Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Uganda). The publication is based on the previous
work commissioned and lead by the World Bank Group to identify country-specific baselines and entry points for scaling
out CSA, through data analysis and series of dialogues with national stakeholders. The work complements the CSA
Profiles series developed since 2014 by the World Bank, CIAT and CCAFS for countries in Latin America, Asia, Eastern
and Central Europe, and Africa (https://ccafs.cgiar.org/publications/csa-country-profiles).
The document was prepared under the co-leadership of Andreea Nowak (CIAT), Caitlin Corner- Dolloff (now USDA),
