Foreword
Agricultural systems in East Africa are mainly rainfed and thus highly vulnerable to climate change and variability. Climate-related
risks such as prolonged dry seasons, droughts and floods have become more frequent and severe with negative impacts on
agricultural livelihoods and food security. These challenges are compounded by high poverty rates, declining land sizes, poor
market access and high population growth rates with increasing demand for food.
Researchers, development partners and farmers are coming up with innovative approaches to address climate variability and
change, building on existing knowledge and institutional systems. The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture
and Food Security (CCAFS), is partnering with farmers, development organizations, and national and international agricultural
research organizations in East Africa to test and promote a portfolio of climate-smart agricultural technologies and practices,
including institutional innovations and linking with policy makers at sub-national and national levels. Through the partnership,
smallholder farmers are changing their farming practices as they respond to climate risks and adapt to climate change.
This booklet presents some of the emerging stories of success of climate-smart agriculture technologies and practices that are
positively changing the lives of smallholder farmers across East Africa. They were selected from a portfolio of climate-smart
agriculture interventions and have potential for scaling up. We hope that the stories contribute to promoting climate-smart
agriculture, and help other smallholder farmers in similar vulnerable systems.

Introduction
Climate change and increased climate variability present new risks
and vulnerability for smallholder farmers in East Africa who depend
mainly on rainfed agriculture for their livelihoods.
Chapter One

Poverty, reduced labour availability and limited options
for diversified livelihoods make these communities more
vulnerable to climate risks, with direct negative impacts on
household food security and nutritional status.
To address this challenge, the CGIAR Research Program
on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)
has developed the Climate-Smart Village (CSV) Research
for Development (R4D) approach. Using participatory
methods, we test technological and institutional options for
dealing with climate change in agriculture, with the aim of
scaling up and out the appropriate options and drawing out
lessons for policy makers from local to global levels.
Climate-Smart Villages act as ‘lighthouses’, to demonstrate
how communities can test, co-develop and adopt
integrated portfolios of climate-smart agriculture (CSA)
practices (see Figure 1). They provide a solid framework
through which to investigate the enabling environment that
facilitates the adoption of CSA practices, and they build the
evidence base to support scaling up and out CSA.

This publication highlights emerging lessons from ongoing
participatory testing of a portfolio of CSA technologies
and practices in the CCAFS CSVs in East Africa, including
institutional innovations. In each CSV, CCAFS works in
collaboration with national agricultural research and
extension systems and the rural communities. CCAFS
facilitates these partnerships around collective action
initiatives to bring a scientific approach to delivering
development outcomes in the CSVs.

Climate-Smart Villages in East Africa
Climate-Smart Villages are clusters of villages or landscapes
that focus on climate change hotspots around the world.
CCAFS started piloting the CSV approach in East Africa in
2012. In each CSV, a number of climate-smart interventions
may be introduced, but there is no one-size-fits-all approach.
The interventions vary depending on the agro-ecological
characteristics of the CSV, level of development, capacity and
the interests of farmers and local government partners (see
Figure 2).
In East Africa, CCAFS facilitates six CSVs: Lushoto (Tanzania),
Wote and Nyando (Kenya), Hoima and Rakai (Uganda), and
Borana (Ethiopia). Across the CSVs, smallholder farmers
face various climate-related risks that include prolonged
dry seasons and increased incidence of pests and diseases,
which have become more frequent and intense, and have
negative impacts on agricultural production.
To address climate-related risks and improve capacity
to adapt to climate change, farmers across the CSVs are
coming together through collective action groups. Some
of the farmers groups were initially formed with different
objectives that included pooling financial resources through
Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) schemes,
and pooling of labour during planting and harvesting, based
on principles similar to share-cropping. Other groups were
formed to provide social support to widows, orphans and
vulnerable groups.
These existing and emerging groups are important platforms
for innovative partnerships that provide new knowledge
and skills and build the capacity of local farmers to change
farming practices while adopting new crop and livestock
interventions. They empower members to pool financial
resources for savings, provide labour for farm operations,
and make it easier to provide agro-advisory services and
farm inputs of good quality at affordable prices.
Collective action has often been used by rural communities
for managing natural resources. However, the stories
presented here clearly demonstrate the increasing
importance of collective action in addressing multiple
challenges ranging from food insecurity in mixed crop–
livestock systems of Nyando, Wote and Hoima, to dealing
with the climate-related risks in pastoral systems of Borana
as a social safety net mechanism.
The next section describes the six CSVs in East Africa from
which the stories are drawn, providing a background on their
agro-ecology and the community-based organizations that
underpin all the interventions.
Many different CGIAR Centers are involved in research
activities in the villages. These include the International
Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), the International Crops
Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT),
International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), the
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the
International Potato Center (CIP).

Lushoto, Tanzania
Agro-ecology
Lushoto, in north-eastern Tanzania, is hilly with very
steep slopes. It is characterized by a diversity of micro-
agro-ecological zones within a relatively small area. Land
degradation is high and 65% of farmland is classified as
degraded. The area is highly populated, with an average of
0.4 ha per household. Average annual rainfall is variable,
ranging from 800 to 1300 mm (Figure 3). However, the
first rains often start later than expected. The second rainy
season is less reliable than the first and rains have been
inadequate in three of the past ten years. This reduces the
length of the crop growing period. This risk is made worse
by an upsurge in crop and livestock pests and diseases
caused by climate variability. Most households rely on crop
production, rather than livestock, because of the small size
of land holdings in Lushoto.
Collective action initiatives
Three community-based organizations were established in
Lushoto in 2012: Kwamaga, Mbukwa and Yaboga. In 2014,
these were transformed into village savings and credit
cooperative societies (SACCOs). The three SACCOs operate in
29 villages in Lushoto, which include 1089 active households
and 55% of the membership is made up of women. SACCOs
are more appealing sources of loans for farmers than
microfinancial institutions, because the SACCOs operate
under a community arrangement that helps people to repay
loans. Members have mobilized financial resources to create
an innovation fund worth USD 35 000. Members can borrow
money from the innovation fund for on-farm agricultural
investments, and in particular, horticulture. The SACCOS are
an avenue for climate information services and also provide
access to agricultural inputs. They have been effective in
mobilizing members to establish soil conservation structures,
as well as tree nurseries. This has contributed to the planting
of 500 000 trees in three years, supporting the target of 10%
tree cover set by the Lushoto District Council.

Wote, Kenya
Agro-ecology
Wote, in eastern Kenya, is a semi-arid area with bimodal
annual rainfall ranging between 480 and 800 mm. Rainfall
is poorly distributed over the first rainy season in April and
May, resulting in a short crop growing period and high water
stress. Temperatures and evaporation rates are generally high
and when it rains, flooding occurs. This has led to erosion
that affects 25% of the landscape. An increased incidence of
pests and diseases in the past 20 years negatively affects crop
and livestock production. The incidence of Aflatoxin fungal
disease, for example, has increased in dryland eastern Kenya
including Wote, and farmers can lose up to 50% of their grain
harvest.
Collective action initiatives
Two community-based organizations (Sinai-Kikeneani and
Kikumini-Muvau) were formed in Wote in 2014. Initially
covering seven villages, these CBOs have increased their
membership from 140 to 620 households within two years,
with women making up about 70% of the membership.
Over the two-year period, the CBOs pooled their financial
resources into a combined innovation fund of USD 39 000.
Members can borrow from the fund, mostly for investment
in agricultural activities such as production of high value
horticultural crops and poultry farming, to help them
manage climate-related risks. The Wote CBOs also provide an
avenue for dissemination of climate-smart technologies like
cereal–legume intercrops, and soil and water conservation
structures on-farm. The CBOs have encouraged their
members to diversify their crop choices, and cultivation of
new crop varieties has increased from 72% of the households
in 2014 to 92% by the end of 2015.

Nyando, Kenya
mainly to purchase agricultural inputs, buy food, school fees
and to support small trade (basket weaving and shops). The
organizations have set up smart-farm demonstrations that
include greenhouse farming, combined with drip irrigation.
They also manage open field demonstration plots used for
seed multiplication for the community.
Through the three community-based organizations, farmers
receive training during field days and trade fairs organized
by the Agricultural Society of Kenya. The organizations
established an input supply shop to facilitate farmers’ access
to agricultural inputs of high quality at affordable prices. This
has led to a 50% reduction in the number of farmers using
local unimproved seeds. The community-based organizations
also facilitate access to climate information services (CIS),
which is used by some 70% of the farmers for on-farm
decision-making.

Agro-ecology
The Nyando basin sits in the rain shadow of the Mau
Escarpment. Farmers grow maize, beans and sorghum, and
keep livestock in a mixed farming system. About 65% of
the annual rainfall of 1200 mm generally falls during the
main growing season of March to May, with the other 35%
expected in the minor rainy season between October and
December. The onset of seasonal rainfall is highly variable.
Long dry spells occur following an early onset of rains, while
extreme flooding often occurs after a late onset. Dry periods
after the onset of rains reduce the effective length of the
main growing season. Analysis of 50-year historical data
shows that the onset of rainfall appears to have drifted from
what farmers perceive as the start around mid-February to a
true onset about mid-March. Land degradation affects about
40% of the landscape, with negative impacts on farming.
Collective action initiatives
The communities in Nyando have organized themselves into
three large community-based organizations—Friends of
Katuk Odeyo (FOKO), North-East Community Development
Program (NECODEP) and Kapsokale. The three organizations
are made up of 50 self-help groups from 106 villages,
representing about 2500 households. Women make up 80%
of the members of the self-help groups.
Between 2011 and 2015, the three community-based
organizations pooled their financial resources, and increased
the total available from USD 14 000 to USD 95 000. This
formed the Nyando innovation fund. About 90% of the
farmers have borrowed from the fund. Loans are used

Hoima and Rakai, Uganda
These areas have also experienced an increase of diseases
and pests affecting crops and livestock.
Collective action initiatives
In Hoima, two community-based organizations—the
Bagonza-Kukora and Kyabigambire Farmers Organization—
were formed in 2013 and initially covered seven villages.
Within three years, they had expanded to reach a total of
15 villages, including 720 households, with pooled financial
resources totalling USD 41 000. The membership of the
farmers’ organizations is equally split between men and
women. Members can borrow funds, which are mostly used
for on-farm agricultural investments such as horticulture, as
well as chicken and pig enterprises that have a ready market.
The community-based organizations have been an important
avenue to promote climate-smart technologies such as
resilient, new crop varieties that have now been planted by
97% of the households.
Partners

Rakai, in southern Uganda, also has a mixed farming system.
Bananas and beans are the common crops and, like Hoima,
chickens and goats are the main livestock. The area receives
an average annual rainfall of about 1200 mm, but rainfall
distribution is poor, with gradually reduced river flow and
high water stress over the years.
In both Hoima and Rakai, the second rainy season from
August to November is less reliable than the first rains in
March to May because of its uneven rainfall distribution.
Agro-ecology
In Hoima, western Uganda, average annual rainfall is about
1400 mm (Figure 6), but this average masks a high level of
variability, which can result in late onset or early cessation
of rains. Hoima is characterized by a mixed farming system.
Farmers commonly grow cassava, sweet potatoes and beans,
while chickens and goats are found on most farms. Soil
erosion is widespread in Hoima, affecting almost 20% of the
landscape, and soil fertility is declining.

Borana, Ethiopia
Agro-ecology
Borana, in southern Ethiopia, experiences more frequent
droughts than the other CSVs. With bimodal average
annual rainfall of only 500 mm, Borana has experienced
five droughts in the last ten years. In this semi-arid region,
characterized largely by a pastoral farming system, most
households rely on livestock and related products for their
livelihoods. When it does rain, there is considerable spatial
and temporal variability in rainfall amount and distribution,
leading to limited forage and water resources for livestock.
More than 60% of the landscape is bare and degraded,
and there are increasingly frequent disease outbreaks that
cause high livestock mortality rates especially during the dry
season.
Collective action initiatives
In 2011, two umbrella collective action groups existed in
Borana, bringing together many smaller groups. CCAFS and
partners initiated a systematic capacity building programme,
which has enabled the two groups to recruit more members.
By 2015, this totalled 450 households. They pooled financial
resources amounting to USD 4000 and this is used to fund
local investments such as enclosures to provide more pasture
for fattening livestock, and diversification into poultry
production and dryland crops. Generally collective action has
enhanced rangeland rehabilitation measures in Borana.

Improved crop varieties and
resilient livestock breeds
Chapter Two

Story 1.
Better beans
Beans are an inexpensive source of protein for rural and
urban households in Africa. They are vital for reducing
poverty and improving food security and nutrition. But
beans are a fragile crop, relying on stable temperatures and
lots of water to grow. Bean production is greatly affected by
environmental stresses including drought, excessive rain,
flooding, heat and cold, as well as biotic constraints such as
field and post-harvest pests and diseases. These challenges
are expected to become more pronounced
as climatic conditions change and become
more variable. Vast areas of sub-Saharan
Africa, especially in East Africa, are
projected to become unsuitable for bean
production within 50 years.
Improved bean varieties have been developed
that can withstand some of these climate-
related constraints. Yet adoption rates remain low.
In the CCAFS learning sites of Lushoto, Hoima and Rakai,
researchers from several organizations have been working
with farmers through a participatory action research
approach to improve farmers’ access to seeds of improved
bean varieties and establish a sustainable seed delivery
system. Despite the erratic rainfall patterns in these sites, the
research has enhanced productivity by promoting drought
tolerant bean varieties, together with improved agronomic
practices.
In Lushoto, community-based organizations provided a
platform for distribution of the improved seeds through
village seed banking. This enabled members to develop
their own guidelines and policies governing the community
seed bank. An estimated 300 kg of improved bean seed
was contributed to each village seed bank for distribution
to farmers. Improved agronomic practices were also
introduced, including row planting instead of broadcasting,
and disease and pest control measures to increase yield.
During the first growing season of 2013, a total of 1000 kg
of the improved bean seed Lyamungo 90 were distributed
to 100 farmers in Lushoto. Implemented by SARI and MALF,
this initiative was supported by CCAFS, together with
farmers and other stakeholders. The improved bean variety
had better germination and seedling emergence, and was
relatively resistant to pests and diseases, compared to
local varieties. Bean yields increased three-
fold compared to local varieties, and farmers
harvested an average of 2500 kg per ha.
“If farmers are educated on how best they
can grow their favourite crops like beans, they
are more likely to get higher crop yields from the
existing land, and also increase their income,” says
Atanasio Abel Singano, a farmer from Kwang’wenda
village in Lushoto.
During the second growing season in 2013, a second bean
variety, Selian 97, was introduced alongside Lyamungo 90.
If farmers are educated on how best they
can grow their favourite crops like beans,
they are more likely to get higher crop
yields from the existing land, and also
increase their income.

Different beans for different farmers
In Hoima and Rakai, research under the Pan Africa Bean
Research Alliance (PABRA) evaluated 15 drought tolerant
bean varieties from Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda. In
2012 and 2013, farmers in five villages, including 143 men
and 215 women, evaluated the bean varieties through on-
farm trials.
The farmers reported on bean performance in terms of
growth, yield, adaptability to weather conditions and
fertilizer use, among other traits. They also selected their
preferred bean varieties based on market attributes. Farmer
preferences were then compared with the scientific findings.
Male and female farmers were found to look for different
traits in beans. Men were primarily interested in market
value and yield, while women considered additional benefits,
such as short cooking times, taste and high nutritional value.
By the end of 2014, more than 70% of farmers in Lushoto
were using improved varieties, generating a further increase
in yields. During the 2014 long rains, some 220 farmers in
Lushoto harvested an estimated 20,000 kg of improved bean
varieties. While there were no significant differences in yield
between Selian 97 and Lyamungo 90, farmers preferred
Selian 97 for its taste, attractive colour, shorter cooking time
and uniformity in maturity.
The participatory research process in Lushoto, Rakai and
Hoima (see box) has provided farmers with the technical
knowledge to decide which bean varieties to grow, rather
than relying on chance, price and market availability.
Participatory action research enabled farmers to test
varieties themselves, and select their preferred beans.
Farmer adoption of improved bean varieties was promoted
by distributing seed through community-based farmers’
organizations and providing training in better
agronomic practices. Further research is needed,
however, to breed yet most robust varieties with
even greater resilience to climate change.

Story 2.
Breeding resilient ruminants
Almost 90% of farmers in Nyando keep small ruminants—
mainly local breeds of East African goats and Fat-tailed
sheep. Small ruminant production in this area, however, is
characterized by low productivity and poor recovery from
drought and disease.
Apart from poultry, goats and sheep are the only livestock
assets over which women and young people tend to have
control. They are also less labour intensive than larger
livestock such as cattle. Improved breeds of small ruminants,
coupled with better livestock management practices are key
strategies for transforming their productivity, and supporting
women’s and young people’s livelihoods.

“Small ruminants are a pathway to better livelihoods in East
Africa,” says Julie Ojango, an animal breeding scientist at ILRI.
Since 2011, CCAFS has been working with its partners to
help livestock farmers in Nyando improve the productivity
of their sheep and goats. From 2012 to mid-2013, improved
breeds of Galla goats and Red Maasai sheep were introduced
to farmers in Nyando to be crossed with local breeds to
increase productivity. These breeds were selected because of
their desirable characteristics that include resistance to heat
stress, high productivity, and high growth and multiplication
rates. The improved and resilient breeds of goats and sheep
were introduced through three local community-based
organizations: FOKO, Kapsokale and NECODEP. Farmers in the
three organizations have established about 70 breeding units
of Galla goats and 30 breeding units of Red Maasai sheep.
Each breeding unit comprises a single goat buck, which can
service about 30 does per month, or a Red Maasai sheep
ram, which can serve around 12 ewes a month.
The Red Maasai sheep can withstand heat stress and are
more resistant to diseases and parasites than the local
Fat-tailed sheep. This is important, given that diseases
and parasites are now more widespread as a result of the
warmer climate. And compared to local East African goats,
Galla goats mature up to six months faster, have higher milk
production, and high twinning rates. They also fetch higher
prices in the market, which can be three times the price of
local breeds. A mature Galla goat, for example, costs USD
80–120 while the East African goats sell for only USD 25–30.
“A lot of in-breeding between the East African goats in
the area had resulted in smaller sized animals that do not
fetch the farmer good market prices,” says George Nandi,
a livestock extension officer from MALF, who works closely
with farmers in Nyando.
As a result of the cross-breeding initiative, an average of
2500 cross-bred sheep and 15 000 goats are added to
the Nyando flock every year. To control in-breeding and
maintain high quality breeds, ILRI has initiated a monitoring
and management system. Extension staff from MALF train
farmers on improved housing, feed development and animal
healthcare. Through the partnership, 16 community-based
animal health workers (paravets), have been trained across
the three CBOs to support veterinary officers to manage the
livestock’s health.

The pure and cross-breeds of Galla goats are already in high
demand and CBOs are ‘passing on the gift’: offspring are
given to other community members so they also benefit
from the initiative. Structured training meetings within and
across groups and CBOs enhance knowledge sharing and
learning thus leading to capacity building among members.
Through the partnership, Vi Agroforestry, World Neighbors,
MALF and KALRO have also expanded their extension
services to meet the increasing demand for information
about better feed management, pest and disease control and
breeding practices.
Every year, farmers in Nyando hold learning events, and
participate in county agricultural fairs, where they share
lessons from their local adaptation practices and also learn
from others about different CSA technologies. In June
2015 and July 2016, the Nyando farmers held learning
events about their improved livestock breeds and other
CSA technologies, with more than 5000 farmers and other
stakeholders participating in the events.
As the uptake of the Galla cross-breeds increases, farmers
are devising innovative ways to market their livestock.
An annual goat auction is emerging in the upper parts of
Nyando, where there is a relatively high population of goats.
The first auction was held in 2014 in Barng’oror village, at
which about 1500 goats were auctioned. At the second

annual goat auction in December 2015, the Kenyan Deputy
President, His Excellency William Samoei Ruto attended as
the chief guest. The Deputy President was very impressed
by the CSVs, and in particular by the promotion of livestock
as a way of addressing climate change, food insecurity and
improving incomes. He urged the champion farmers to
continue to share their knowledge with their neighbours to
promote learning and wider adoption of new technologies.
About 4000 goats were sold at the auction, with a single
Galla goat fetching USD 130–160.
Improved breeds of small ruminants are more productive,
more resilient and more valuable than traditional sheep and
goat breeds. As women and young people tend to control
these assets, introducing improved breeds to their flocks
directly and positively impacts their livelihoods. With training
and support on livestock management, and
support from community paravets, farmers
can rapidly increase their flock of improved
sheep and goats, while maintaining the
quality of the breed.

Championing better potatoes
Potatoes are one of the most important food crops in
sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, a much higher proportion of
people’s diets is made up of cereals, roots and tubers in sub-
Saharan Africa than in other regions of Africa. In Lushoto,
potatoes are traditionally grown for food and as a cash crop.
Farmers mostly grow local varieties, such as Kidinya. But
this dominant variety is highly susceptible to late blight so
farmers can only plant it once a year to avoid the months
when disease pressure is high. As a result, production is
limited to one harvest per year and yields are low.
“The most important way of controlling late blight is to
prevent its onset in the field—its control being very costly
and thus less accessible to small-scale farmers when
symptoms are already visible. Coming up with resistant
potato varieties is therefore a game changer,” says
Dieudonné Harahagazwe, a researcher at CIP.
Since 2013, CCAFS has partnered with CIP and several other
organizations to work with smallholder farmers in Lushoto to
co-evaluate better potato varieties. The aims are to enable
farmers to access potato varieties that can be grown all year
round, and increase potato yields. Farmers, extension agents
and NGO officers in Lushoto took part in an action research
approach to help them develop their agronomic skills and
select potato varieties that suit their needs.
The approach combined training-of-trainers sessions and
participatory varietal selection. Participants took part in five
training-of-trainers modules spanning two growing seasons,
with three modules in the long rainy season and two in the
short season. The first round of training covered important
components of crop management, from land preparation to
seed storage. The second round was participant-led, covering
areas that emerged during the first round.
Participants also tested advanced potato materials (clones,
yet to be formally released) and improved varieties (Asante,
Shangii and Obama) with the local variety, Kidinya, as a
control. With guidance from CIP and SARI, participants
grew the varieties on a demonstration farm at the Lushoto
Resource Center. Farmers also tested some of the varieties
on their farms. Both the advanced clones and improved
varieties outperformed the local Kidinya in terms of yield and
resistance to late blight and high temperatures.
Three years later, farmers who participated in the trials have
doubled their yields and changed their livelihoods. In 2014,
Samuel Tendwa was among 70 farmers from three villages
in Lushoto that worked with CIP and partners over four
consecutive growing seasons.
“Asante is a completely new potato variety in our area, and
with the help of these researchers, I have learned to produce
high-quality potato for seed and consumption,” says Samuel.
Asante is a completely new potato variety
in our area, and with the help of these
researchers, I have learned to produce high-
quality potato for seed and consumption.

During the short rainy season of 2014, Samuel and nine
other champion farmers from his village, each received one
80 kg bag of clean Asante potato seed. With knowledge
and skills acquired from the training, they planted the seed
during the first season. Samuel harvested 1000 kg from his
0.2 ha farm, which was near the optimum yield, and double
his previous harvests. Samuel and other champion farmers
sold three-quarters of their potato seed. The price they
received of USD 70 per bag, was double the normal price
of potatoes for consumption, because they were selling a
higher value seed product. The remainder was stored as seed
for the subsequent planting season.
During 2015, champion farmers who had participated in
the training sessions spearheaded village learning events
to share their agronomic knowledge and promote wider
planting of improved varieties. A total of 135 farmers in
neighbouring villages planted the high quality Asante potato
seed in 2015, which they sold locally to another 450 farmers
for consumption and seed. In the first rainy season of 2016,
it was estimated that more than 1000 farmers were planting
the Asante potato variety in Lushoto.

Farmers who participated in the training-of-trainers and
participatory varietal selection processes are proud of the
varieties they helped select. As two of the high yielding
trial materials moved towards formal release, the farmers
proposed formal names for them to reflect their qualities.
Mvono, named for its high number and size of tubers, and
Mkanano, meaning highly competitive, are being formally
released in Tanzania in 2016.
Farmers’ participation in the selection of potato varieties and
training has enabled many of them to improve their crop
management and made new varieties accessible to them.
Improved varieties that resist disease pressure have higher
yields, and have opened new, more valuable seed
markets. With better potato varieties and
improved agricultural practices, farmers are
improving their incomes and are better able
to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Testing high-yielding root crops
Cassava and sweet potato are the two most important
starchy root crops for most communities in Uganda. The
crops are grown in mixtures with legumes and cereals on
small plots of land, generally with no inputs other than
labour. Currently, however, pests and diseases represent a
major constraint to their production. African cassava mosaic
virus, as well as bacterial blight, mealybug and green spider
mite have decimated cassava production. Likewise, sweet
potatoes are plagued by weevils, nematodes and insect
pests. Farmers mainly grow low yielding varieties of cassava
and sweet potato, and both crops have average national
yields of about 5 tons per ha.
Since 2013, farmers in Hoima have been working with CCAFS
and partners to test new, resilient, high yielding cassava
and sweet potato varieties. NARO, in partnership with CIP,
has identified and developed improved, superior sweet
potato genotypes that are high yielding, early maturing,
drought tolerant and contain high levels of β-Carotene, a
precursor of Vitamin A. Similarly, in partnership with IITA,
NARO has developed improved cassava that is more resistant
to drought and water stress and has pest and disease
resistance, as well as high yielding traits and high levels of
protein and vitamin A.
Through participatory action research, suitable varieties
of both crops were introduced in Hoima in 2013. The two
local community-based organizations were instrumental
in spreading the innovations and promoting uptake of
the new varieties to individual farmers through village
demonstrations, field days and multiplication of planting
material. Within a period of three years, more than 750
households have planted a new cassava variety (NASE-14)
and two new varieties of sweet potatoes (NASPOT-11 and
NASPOT-8).
Alice Nyangoma, a farmer in Kasinina village in Hoima attests
to a good sweet potato harvest with the newly introduced
varieties:
“I have observed higher pest tolerance and disease
resistance capabilities, and shorter maturity period of four
months for the new varieties,” she says.
Apart from the improved varieties, farmers are also using
better agronomic practices that include crop rotation, early
planting and fertilizers, coupled with soil conservation,
following training by NARO and local agricultural extension
staff from the Ministry of Agriculture.
“The new improved sweet potato varieties yield about 30
tons per ha per season compared to the 5 tons produced by
the local varieties,” says NARO scientist, Fred Sekiwoko.
“The new NASE-14 cassava variety matures in seven months
while the local cassava takes about a year to mature.
I have observed higher pest tolerance and
disease resistance capabilities, and shorter
maturity period of four months for the new
varieties.

Besides, I have been harvesting the improved cassava variety
for three years now, while the local type lasts for less than
two years on the farms,” says farmer Godfrey Kairagura, a
member of Kyabigambire Farmers Organization.
Researchers have involved women’s groups in the evaluation
of the new varieties to hasten adoption and use of selected
varieties. This participatory approach also ensures that
the traits that are important to farmers are evaluated.
Experienced cassava and sweet potato farmers—who are
mainly women—bring to the evaluation detailed knowledge
about traits that researchers might not consider important or
may not be able to measure satisfactorily. This approach also
accelerates the rate at which new varieties reach farmers’
hands.

Scaling up smart farms
Farmers in Nyando wait for the major rains to start from
the middle of February onwards. But the variability of
seasonal rainfall and climate change have pushed the onset
back, sometimes as far as mid-March, making it difficult for
farmers to plan. Long dry spells and early cessation shorten
the growing season, while extreme flooding occurs after late
onset rains because of the intensity of the rainfall.
“A lot has changed in Nyando. Most of the times, it is very
dry. When rains come, they tend to be very intense and
short,” explains Wilson Aore, a scientist with KALRO.
In order to address the challenges of seasonal rainfall
variability, degraded land and declining farm sizes in Nyando,
CCAFS is collaborating with government agencies, NGOs
and the private sector to introduce the smart farm concept.
Smart farms involve farming in greenhouses, combined
with drip irrigation supplied by a mini-earth dam. Other
smart farm technologies include water conservation and
management, bulking of horticultural crop seed and fodder
production for livestock. The smart farms save water, offer
better control of pests and diseases, and are free from
flooding and drought. Because the production cycle is
regular, the harvest can be better timed for local markets.
Smart farms can help farmers to produce reliable harvests
and increase yields, despite the challenges and variability
introduced by climate change. Although it has many
advantages, however, greenhouse production requires a high
level of skills and knowledge for successful operation. To
address this, CCAFS and its partners train young people and
women’s groups to equip them with the skills and knowledge
they need.
By the end of 2015, smart farms had been established in
four villages in Nyando: Obinju, Kamula, Kapsorok and
Onyuongo. These smart farms are managed by young people
and women’s groups and serve as demonstration sites for
other groups, as well as the wider community. The initial
investment cost of a smart farm is about USD 3000, with
the potential to yield four times this sum over two or three
production cycles.
The Kamula Village Youth Group, for example, is determined
that their smart farm will provide a learning hub for the
entire village. Ultimately they aim to see smart farms
replicated across the village, boosting food production and
significantly improving food and nutrition security. Kamula
Youth Group’s smart farm incorporates improved crop
varieties, including tomatoes, cow pea, climbing beans and
indigenous crotalaria. The group has created a small earth
dam with a capacity of 300 000 L of water, and stock it with
1000 fingerlings per season; and they manage five colonized
bee hives, as well as fodder crops such as Boma Rhodes and
Napier grass.
In 2013 when we started, people in the
village were not sure what the group aimed
to achieve. However, after one year, good
results began to emerge.

According to Jackson Onyango, the group leader: “In 2013
when we started, people in the village were not sure what
the group aimed to achieve. However, after one year, good
results began to emerge.”
During the first year, the three main enterprises—fish
farming, tomatoes and vegetable production—earned
approximately USD 5000. Using proceeds from the smart
farm, Kamula Youth Group opened a bank account to save
money for future projects that include a solar system to
power operations like pumping water from the adjacent river
into tanks and earth dams.
Given the interest that the group’s work generates, school
groups and delegations of village residents frequently visit
the hub, sharing the experience generated with the wider
community. And through the group, model farmers who can
take the lead in transforming rural agriculture are emerging.
Smart farms, managed by young people and women’s groups
in a small number of villages, act as learning hubs for others
in the community, and incubators for tomorrow’s lead
farmers. Smart farm technology has potential
to boost food production, improve food
security and increase incomes, but requires
knowledge and skills for management.

Story 6.
Conserving soil and water through agroforestry
Erosion is a major challenge in Lushoto affecting more
than 60% of the landscape. Huge open gullies in the vast
farming fields are visible from miles away. Land degradation
is compounded by the high population density, and there is
increasing pressure on the land. For most farmers, the only
land available for cultivation is the hilly slopes. In villages
like Mbuzii, for example, the light textured soils are low in
organic matter and have low fertility for crop production.
Agroforestry is a promising intervention that can contribute
both to climate change mitigation and soil and water
conservation. Agroforestry has ecological and economic
benefits too, providing farming families with the ‘five
Fs’—food, fuel, fodder, finance and improved soil fertility.
By integrating trees on farms and rangelands, farmers can
reduce their dependency on a single staple crop, diversify
their livelihood options and reverse land degradation.
To address soil erosion and land degradation in Lushoto,
CCAFS East Africa and several partners are working with
farmers to improve land management. Over a two-year
period from 2013–2015, farmers in Lushoto constructed
about 100 km of terraces, in an area that includes more than
1000 farming households. CCAFS partners Lushoto District
Council and SARI are providing training for households that
are members of three village savings and credit cooperative
societies (SACCOs), on techniques to help prevent erosion
and enhance water retention. This involves the construction
and integration of terraces with contoured grass strips
to prevent massive loss of rich top soil, enhance water
retention and provide fodder for livestock.
“We now see the difference that the improved terraces are
bringing to the landscape, through water flow control and
retention,” says farmer Swadakati of Mbuzii village.
The initiative is also encouraging and training farmers to
establish tree nurseries and plant trees on their farms.
Increased tree cover controls soil erosion as it reduces the
impact of raindrops on bare soils and prevents the wind
removing soil particles. The ground cover and litter layer
beneath the trees reduce the speed of water flowing over
the land, and help control soil erosion. In 2013, TAFORI
provided 17 000 tree seedlings to 100 households to initiate
We now see the difference that the
improved terraces are bringing to the

the tree planting campaign. The target is to achieve tree
cover of at least 10%, in line with Lushoto District Council’s
policy.
Priority areas have been identified that require urgent tree
cover. These include open areas, farmland and road sides.
Selection of tree species is based on the needs of farmers
in the village. Farmers’ preferred tree species include Pinus
patula and Eucalyptus grandis for wood; Grevillea robusta
for farm boundaries and contours; Casuarina cuninghamiana
for wind breaks and along roadsides; and avocadoes, plums
and apples for fruit.
To meet the growing demand for tree seedlings, farmers
have established tree nurseries within their villages. The
three farmer SACCOs have established 20 nurseries, which
are managed by affiliated farmer groups and have capacity
to produce a total of 200 000 tree seedlings every season.
In Milungui village, for example, in 2016 the farmers’
group established a tree nursery and produced some
20 000 seedlings. Each member of the group is entitled to

Combating soil erosion in Nyando
In Nyando, Kenya, soil erosion is a key challenge every rainy
season, with run-off forming deep gullies that affect about
40% of the landscape. To tackle this problem, farmers in
Nyando have organized themselves into community-based
organizations that include more than 10 000 households.
The members, 60% of whom are women and young
people below the age of 25, are working with CCAFS and
other partners to increase on-farm tree cover. Through
this partnership, more than 40 tree nurseries have been
established, with capacity to produce 140 000 high quality
seedlings per season.
The selection of the tree species is based on farmers’ needs
and technical advice from Vi Agroforestry extension staff.
These species include Grevillea robusta, Markhamia lutea,
Casuarina spp., Carica papaya and Eucalyptus spp. Sale of
the seedlings will generate income for the group and the
nursery will supply the local community with high quality
tree seedlings for agroforestry and woodlots. The number of
tree nurseries, as well as their capacity, have increased five-
fold between 2011 and 2015. With a survival rate of 75%, the
on-farm tree population has increased by at least 500 000
trees over the five-year period.
Intercropping fruit trees
In Hoima, Uganda, farmers are intercropping fruit trees
(grafted mangoes and pawpaws) with food crops such
as maize, sorghum, cassava, sweet potato, nitrogen
fixing legumes (beans and groundnuts) and indigenous
vegetables. By planting the trees across contours and on
terraces, they aim to conserve the soil by reducing erosion.
Farmers are advised to intercrop the mangoes with sweet
potatoes in the first year and a half, to reap the benefits of
intercropping while conserving soils and water. They also
dig water retention ditches and trenches for soil and water
conservation.
Julius Masanyu, an agroforestry scientist at Bulindi Zonal
Agricultural Research and Development Institute, says
the improved mangoes take a maximum of three years to
produce their first yield, compared to local varieties that
can take up to six years. Improved mangoes are also higher
yielding, and have better tasting fruit, with better market
prices, than the local mangoes. An improved mango tree
produces up to 1500 fruits a year, compared to about 250
mangoes produced by the local varieties.
Stories of Success: Climate-Smart Villages in East Africa   23
a number of tree seedlings from the nursery, depending on
their level of involvement in the group’s activities. To ensure
sustainability, 25% of the seedlings are sold and the proceeds
used to sustain the nursery. Members take the other 75% of
the seedlings for planting on their farms. By scaling up the
interventions through local policy engagement processes, it
is expected that at least 100 000 farmers will have 10% tree
cover on-farm within the next four years.
Similar initiatives supporting farmers to plant trees on
farms are seen across the other CSVs. These efforts are
underpinned by local community-based organizations, local
government, partners and researchers, in collaboration with
CCAFS (see boxes).
Working through farmers’ organizations has potential to
scale up agroforestry interventions across wide areas,
increasing tree cover on farms, and supporting soil
conservation and water management at scale.
Tree nurseries managed by farmers’ groups and
CBOs provide income and seedlings for group
members, while also supplying other farmers
with seedlings.

Story 7.
Sharing better climate information
Farmers need reliable, relevant and local climate information
to help them make sound farming decisions—what to plant,
when to plant, when to harvest and so on. With increasing
climate variability, reliable climate information services (CIS)
become ever more important. Since the climate related risks
are location specific, CIS providers need to find innovative
ways to involve and reach out to local users.
Providers of CIS are approaching the process in a number of
ways. Bringing in indigenous knowledge and sharing climate
information in ways that improve access to farmers are key
strands of these approaches.
In Lushoto, Tanzania, three partner organizations have
spearheaded an initiative, with coordination from CCAFS, to
provide such information. The initiative started by identifying
and documenting existing indigenous knowledge on weather
forecasting in Lushoto. They recorded indigenous indicators
like changes in behaviour of domestic and wild animals, plant
characteristics, wind movement, appearance of the moon,
cloud formation and air temperature.
Working with the three village savings and credit
cooperative societies (SACCOs) in Lushoto, they created
three indigenous knowledge forecasting teams. Each team
also represents an agro-ecological zone (humid, sub-humid,
and lowlands), ensuring a local focus to the forecasts.
Every three months the teams meet with experts from
the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA) to compare
indigenous forecasts with seasonal outlook forecasts from
TMA. Following the meetings, the integrated forecasts are
packaged for dissemination to the wider community using
a number of tools. Gradually this has resulted in the cross
fertilization and gradual integration of indigenous knowledge
and scientific weather forecasting for risk management.
A variety of tools are used to share forecasts, ranging from
word-of-mouth to mobile phone applications. The Farm SMS
tool uses a mobile phone short message service (SMS) to
send climate forecast information to farmers. This enables
subscribing farmers to receive timely alerts, advisories, and
weather forecasts that are issued by TMA in the national
language, Swahili. More traditional mechanisms such as
word-of-mouth and printed flyers help broaden the reach of
the forecasts. The service, which began in 2012, now reaches
more than 1000 households in Lushoto, enabling them to
make better farm management decisions.
“The regular seasonal weather forecasts that I receive
through text message to my phone, through radio, and

Interactive SMS forecasts
Within the Nyando basin, a partnership of five organizations
provides about 700 farmers with local, village-level
seasonal and short-term (5-day) weather forecasts through
mobile phone SMS. The SMS is followed by face-to-face
discussions between farmers, agriculture extension officers
and researchers to interpret results and analyse the risks.
Following this consultation, farmers are better equipped to
make informed decisions about what crops and varieties to
plant, as well as planting dates. At the end of each season,
a review meeting is held to assess the yields resulting
from farming decisions made on the basis of the climate
information. The system reaches 1675 households through
three community-based organizations.
Involving farmers in data collection
In Hoima, local farmers and Uganda’s National Agricultural
Research Organization (NARO) are also working to integrate
indigenous knowledge with scientific forecasts. Here farmers
actively participate in the collection of rainfall data. Rain
gauges were installed on selected farms and farmers take
daily readings, which they submit for expert analysis. This
climate information is then shared with other farmers
through the Kyabigambire and Bagonza-Kukora farmer
groups. More than 720 households now use the climate
information service, enhancing their ability to make the right
decisions about planting dates and types of crops to plant.
The stories from Hoima and Nyando show some of the
diverse ways in which farmers are engaging in other CSVs
(see boxes). In another new initiative supported by USAID,
CCAFS and partners are seeking to transform Rwanda’s
rural farming communities and national economy through
improved climate risk management. By the end of the
project in 2019, nearly a million farmers will have timely
access to climate services. The project builds on many years
of applied research on climate services for agriculture by
CCAFS and our partners in Africa and beyond.
Integrating indigenous knowledge and farmer data collection
with scientific forecasting keeps climate information systems
relevant to farmers and locally applicable. A combination of
new technology and traditional communication
helps disseminate climate information,
enabling farmers to make better farming
decisions.

Introducing intercrop innovations
In Wote, eastern Kenya, farmers cultivate maize, cowpeas
and pigeon peas as their staple crops. Food insecurity
resulting from frequent droughts is a major challenge
and crop failure is common, partly because of inadequate
rainfall and poor soils that are deficient in phosphorous and
nitrogen. A household baseline survey conducted in early
2012 showed that only 2% of the surveyed households were
‘food secure’ all year long. A further 1% reported that they
had enough food for their families for ten months of the
year. More than 95% of the households surveyed stated that
they had sufficient food to feed their family for only two
months a year.
In order to increase farm resilience, as well as improve food
security and incomes, a number of partners are working
with the Makueni County Government and farmers through
community-based organizations, to evaluate and promote
cereal–legume intercrop technologies. Since 2012, with
CCAFS’ support, drought tolerant varieties of sorghum,
cowpeas and green grams have been introduced to farmers
in Wote.
The intercrops provide multiple benefits to farmers. Legumes
fix nitrogen in the soil, leading to better harvests; and the
intercrops suppress weeds and reduce crop susceptibility
to insects and diseases, reducing use of chemicals such as
pesticides. The crops efficiently utilize limited soil moisture
during the growing period, increasing productivity and
reducing incidences of crop failure.
“In Wote, only one in four years is a reliable season. Farmers
need to diversify their crops and embrace improved varieties
of sorghum, cowpeas and green grams,” says Rachel Kisilu, a
researcher at KALRO in Katumani.
These improved varieties were developed by KALRO and
ICRISAT for semi-arid areas. They are early maturing, disease
resistant, pest tolerant and high yielding. Three improved
sorghum varieties—KARI Mtama I, Seredo and Gadam—are
intercropped with a legume crop (cowpea, pigeon pea or
green grams) each time.
“Sorghum is a good and nutritious food just like maize, and it
can thrive and yield under water stress conditions compared
to the maize,” says Muoti Mwangangi, Wote sub-county
Deputy Agricultural Officer.
Between 2012 and 2015, farmers and researchers co-
evaluated the intercrops, focusing on specific indicators
that are important for farmers and their families: number
of days to maturity, disease and pest incidence, ability to

withstand lodging (for sorghum), yield levels and palatability.
In 2012, 210 farmers across five villages were involved in the
evaluations. By 2015, more than 10 000 farmers had adopted
resilient cereal–legume intercrops, with most farmers
reporting an average yield of 4 tons of sorghum per ha, a
four-fold increase since 2012.
“I started growing sorghum in 2010 and this has transformed
my family’s life. I have been able to get income, build a
house, have food to eat and pay school fees for my two
children. This is possible because sorghum thrives well with
or without rain and fetches more money than maize. We
sell sorghum at 26 shillings per kilogram, and maize if we
are lucky to harvest at 15 shillings per kilogram,” says Mary
Mathuli, a farmer in Wote.
The evaluations are complemented by farmer field days that
bring together farmers, extension officers and researchers to
share their knowledge. Individual farmers are encouraged to
try at least one sorghum–legume intercrop on their farms.
During the field days, stakeholders noted that sorghum–
legume intercrops were outstanding, with robust growth and
uniform flowering compared to the maize–bean intercrop

commonly grown in the area. Some improved sorghum
varieties, such as Gadam, were also found to mature faster
than other varieties. To add value to the new intercrop
combinations, agricultural extension officers also teach
farmers how to prepare sorghum dishes and livestock feed,
and about post-harvest processing and storage. Finally, they
incorporate training on composting and mulching sorghum–
legume residues.
Cereal–legume intercrops offer farmers multiple benefits
that contribute to increased farm resilience, greater food
security and better incomes. Working through CBOs and
sharing knowledge through farmer field days has encouraged
farmers in the area to adopt the intercrop combinations
and improved varieties. New crop varieties
like sorghum are better adapted to frequent
drought conditions and can fetch better prices
in the market than traditional local varieties.

Linking local
actions to policy
Chapter Four

Story 9.
Linking local action with national, regional
and global policies and processes
Maintaining agricultural growth while minimizing climate
shocks is crucial to building resilient food production
systems and meeting development goals in vulnerable
countries. Climate-Smart Villages (CSVs) act as test grounds
for combinations of climate-smart agricultural (CSA)
technologies. They are ‘lighthouses’ that demonstrate how
communities can test, co-develop and adopt integrated
portfolios of options to increase their resilience to climate
change.
What have we learned?
The stories described here provide many beacons of light,
that can inform local, national and international climate
change policies and strategies. They highlight common
features that recur throughout the different cases in different
villages:
• Community-based organizations underpin successful
interventions, providing an organizational structure and local
financing. This helps farmers to invest in new technologies
and practices, share and scale up interventions across wide
areas, as seen in the agroforestry initiatives in Lushoto and
Nyando.
• Farmers have capacities to test, select, adapt and adopt
technologies when given the right skills, opportunities and
knowledge. Farmers’ participation in the selection of bean
varieties in Hoima, Rakai and Lushoto ensured that the new
climate-resilient varieties met their needs and were rapidly
adopted.
• Inclusion of women, young people and men is fundamental
to success. Working through community-based organizations
that include young people, women and men helps develop
new technologies that are appropriate for all farmers.
• Training and technical support are key to the adoption and
sharing of improved technologies, and are a feature of all
the stories. Training-of-trainers, farmer learning events and
agricultural trade fairs help farmers share their knowledge
with others, scaling out technologies.
• Research is essential for all climate-smart agricultural
interventions, whether this is through the development
of new crop varieties, improved breeds of livestock, new
technologies or new social innovations to share and support
them.
• New technologies bring opportunities for farmers to
participate in new markets, such as the goat auction in
Nyando and seed potato sales in Lushoto. Ensuring farmers
can access and benefit from markets is essential to success
of many interventions.
Taking lessons from local to global level
The need for evidence-based policy making for agricultural
transformation in Africa cannot be overlooked, especially in
the context of a changing climate. CCAFS is building on the
evidence that is emerging from the CSVs to support policy at
all levels.
CCAFS’ on-farm experimentation with
emissions levels is providing data that will
serve us all.

At a local level, CCAFS is working with the county
governments in Nyando and Wote in Kenya to integrate CSA
practices into the County Integrated Development Plans and
Local Adaptation Plans of Action. This process will provide
further lessons on how to engage policy makers to support
scaling out and up of good practices from the field.
At national and regional levels, CCAFS is collaborating with
governments, development partners, research institutions
and the private sector to support the integration of CSA
into policy and programmes. As a result, pilot CSA country
framework plans have been developed for Botswana, Kenya,
Namibia, Tanzania and Uganda through technical support
from CCAFS, CIAT and ICRAF. The CSA plans in Kenya and
Tanzania have been integrated into the countries’ Intended
Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and were
submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015.
The CSVs also provide learning grounds for policy makers
and other stakeholders. For example, policy delegations
from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda have
had opportunities to interact with farmers and research
institutions in the Nyando CSVs and engage personally
with the farmers. They have been able to gather first-hand
experience of farmers’ efforts to improve their livelihoods,
build resilience, and reduce emissions from agriculture.
The CCAFS CSVs have also hosted a series of high level
delegations of development partners, as well as media crews
from national, regional and international media, which has
enabled the success stories from the villages to be widely
shared. Key media and communication partners include local
television and radio stations in the region, as well as SciDev,
France24, BBC, German TV and the World Bank.
In November 2013, Rachel Kyte, the World Bank Group Vice
President and Special Envoy for Climate Change, visited the
Nyando CSVs in western Kenya. In her blog, published on the
World Bank site, Rachel highlighted the importance of linking
local action to global processes:

“From a global perspective, however, identifying farming
practices that increase production and resilience and reduce
pollution or capture carbon is critical. If agriculture and
land use change continue to produce up to 30% of global
greenhouse gases, it will be close to impossible to slow or
stop global warming. CCAFS’ on-farm experimentation with
emissions levels is providing data that will serve us all.”
Next steps
During the 9th International Conference on Community-
based Adaptation to Climate Change, delegates from 21
countries took the opportunity to learn from CCAFS’ ongoing
work in the CSVs of Wote. As Jean-Pascal Van Ypersele, Vice-
Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) asked:
“The various adaptation initiatives being demonstrated
here are quite encouraging since farmers are now able to
feed their families, as well as earn income to address other
Stories of Success: Climate-Smart Villages in East Africa   31
household needs. However, the big question is: how can we
upscale such initiatives?”
The CSVs offer a testing ground for diverse combinations
of CSA technologies in different contexts. They provide the
emerging evidence base that will support development of
portfolios of interventions that can be adapted and adopted
elsewhere.
The key, as highlighted by Jean-Pascal Van Ypersele, is to find
the mechanisms to scale out these initiatives effectively to
other farmers, investors and practitioners; and to scale up
the results by incorporating the knowledge into national,
regional and global policies and investment plans.
CCAFS scientists are working with policy makers to identify
suitable policy and institutional frameworks to ensure the
lessons from the CSVs contribute to achieving food security
in a changing climate at country, regional and global levels,
and to integrate climate change and agricultural policies.
