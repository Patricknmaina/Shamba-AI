Climate Risk Profile
Kilifi County
Republic of Kenya
Kilifi County is characterized by high poverty estimated at 71.7% and widespread food insecurity affecting approximately
67% of the households. Low-input, rain-fed agriculture is the main source of livelihood in the County, contributing
about 52.7% to the average household income and directly employing more than a half of the total County population.
Cassava, chilli, local poultry, and dairy cattle are key value chain commodities that contribute to both household
food security and livelihoods.
Droughts and floods compromise productivity and food security in Kilifi and are expected to pose
even greater challenges in coming years, as future projections predict increasing drought risk in
First Season (January-June) and increasing flood risk in Second Season (July-December). Poor
infrastructure, limited coverage by extension services, poor quality and eroded soils, and low
agricultural input use are some of the key factors that exacerbate the impacts of climate
change and variability and at the same time limit the ability of farmers and livestock keepers
to cope with these impacts.
Farmers employ a number of on-farm strategies to cope with climate risks and shocks,
including: utilization of drought-resistant crop varieties, water harvesting, conservation
agriculture, tree planting, animal feed conservation, value addition strategies, and
organizing farmer groups for easier access to credit, farm inputs, markets and information.
The main barriers to wider adoption of these strategies include limited knowledge of new
technologies and the know-how to implement them, the inaccessibility of inputs due to
prohibitively high costs, and a lack of access to financial mechanisms to overcome these
obstacles.
Off-farm services for supporting farmers in dealing with climate change and variability
are very limited in Kilifi County. They include early warning information on drought risks,
food security assessments, and the Cash for Assets program by the National Drought
Management Authority (NDMA). Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as
World Vision (WV), Kenya Red Cross (KRC) and Food and Agricultural Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) provide financial services and extension; however, these services are not
uniformly available.
The private sector has played an important role in helping farmers adapt to climate change while
simultaneously supporting market integration. With the support of non-governmental and private actors
(WV, Equator Kenya Limited [EKL]) has encouraged the cultivation of African Bird’s Eye chillies for export,
providing inputs, financial support, extension services, and a stable market to predominantly female farmers.
The Kilifi ABEC Cooperative plays an important role in marketing chilies from more hinterland areas, serving the local
market. This type of collaborative support for adaptation through value chain development could potentially be scaled-
up in the County by having more structured consultative meetings and sharing information on their activities.

Kilifi County
Climate change is becoming one of the most serious
challenges to Kenya’s achievement of its development
goals as described under Vision 2030. Kenya is already
extremely susceptible to climate-related events, and
projections indicate that the impacts are likely to affect
the country even more in the future. In many areas,
extreme events and variability of weather are now the
norm: rainfall is irregular and unpredictable; some
regions experience frequent droughts during the long
rainy season, others severe floods during the short
rains. The arid and semi-arid areas are particularly
hard hit by these climate hazards thereby putting the
lives of millions of households and their social and
economic activities at risk.
In 2010, Kenya developed a National Climate Change
Response Strategy (NCCRS) which recognized the
importance of climate change impacts for Kenya’s
development. This was followed by the development
of the National Climate Change Action Plan in 2012.
Since the focus of these initiatives has been the
national level, as the country shifts towards County
Governance and focus, there is however a need to
mainstream climate change perspectives in programs
and development plans at the County level.
To strengthen local capacities of stakeholders to
reduce the near-, medium- and long-term vulnerability
to current and future climate variability, the Kenyan
Government, through the Ministry of Agriculture,
Livestock and Fisheries (MoALF) is implementing
the Kenya Adaptation to Climate Change in Arid and
Semi-Arid Lands (KACCAL) project. The project is
funded with a grant from the Global Environmental
Facility (GEF)/ Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF)
through the World Bank (WB). The present study is
part of the KACCAL project and aims to inform the
County Government and stakeholders on the climate
change risks and opportunities for agriculture so that
they are able to integrate these perspectives into their
development plans and processes.
This document presents the Climate Risk Profile
for Kilifi County, where climate variability has been
accompanied with a significant increase in attendant
risks, as repeatedly documented in national and
international news coverage. Lack of rainfall, as well
as the late onset and early cessation of both long and
short rains, have made crop failure a recurring hazard
in Kilifi. Drought has created a cycle of food insecurity,
starvation, and reliance on emergency relief that has
been repeated in the County every year since 2013. At
the same time, Kilifi County is experiencing increasingly
worse and more frequent flooding. In 2015, the County
was subjected to the worst floods in more than 20
years. Six seasonal rivers burst their banks cutting off
the road network, destroying homes and crop farms,
and affecting more than 3,000 people, especially in
the Magarini Sub-County1 The magnitude and severity
of these climate hazards makes the identification of
impending climate risks an urgent matter: likewise,
considering how practices that help citizens become
more resilient in the face of climate change becomes
an exercise with the potential to affect hundreds of
thousands of lives.

The profile is organized into six main sections, each
reflecting an essential analytical step in studying
current and potential adaptation options in key local
agricultural value chain commodities. The report first
offers an overview of the County’s main value chain
commodities key to food security and livelihoods,
as well as major challenges to agricultural sector
development. In the next section, the main climate
hazards are identified based on the analysis of
historical climate data and climate projections. Then
it continues with an analysis of the vulnerabilities and
risks posed by the hazards deemed to be potentially
most harmful to the respective value chains. Based
on these vulnerabilities, current and potential on-
farm adaptation options and off-farm services are
discussed. The text also provides snapshots of the
policy, institutional and governance context that can
enable adoption of resilience-building strategies, and
finally presents potential pathways for strengthening
institutional capacity to address potential future
climate risks.

Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series
Economic relevance of farming
Agricultural context
Kilifi County is one of the six counties located in
Kenya’s coastal region. The County covers an area
of 1,260,970 hectares (ha) and borders Athi River
(Galana/Sabaki) to the north, Kwale County to the
southwest, Mombasa County to the south, Taita Taveta
County to the west and the Indian Ocean to the east.
Agriculture is the main income earning activity in the
County, contributing about 52.7% to the household
income (GoK, 2013). The sector employs half of the
total County population. Adult women provide half
of family labour in crop production, while adult men
and youth provide the rest in almost equal share. In
livestock production, adult men and women contribute
the highest share of labour (with each gender providing
46%) while the youth provide the least. The mean daily
per capita income is KSh 47.
According to the Kenya Population and Housing
Census (KPHC) of 2009, the projected population in
20122 was 1,222,928, of which 51.7% were women
and 48.3% men. Around 78.5% of the population
resides in rural areas and depends on agriculture as
the main source of livelihood (GoK, 2009).
The County is characterized by a very high rate of
absolute poverty (71.7%) compared to the national rates
(47%). Several factors are tied to the high incidence of
poverty, including: landlessness estimated at 11.3% of
the households, limited access to piped water (48% of
the population), limited access to electricity for lighting
(11.7%); dependence on firewood for cooking (71%)
and on expensive sources of energy such as kerosene
for lighting (83%). Firewood is mostly collected by
women from farms and mangrove forests. Water
is mostly obtained from boreholes, protected and
unprotected springs, water pans, and rivers whose
access is not guaranteed and quality not known.
The average distance to the nearest water point is 5
kilometers (GoK, 2009).
People and livelihoods
Food insecurity, characterized by a limited availability
of food, infrequent eating, and low food diversity, is
high in the County affecting 98% of the households
(GoK, 2014). There is high rate of undernourishment,
which is evidenced by the high prevalence of stunting in
children of 39.1% (KNBS, 2014). Food insecurity in Kilifi
County is partly attributed to low productivity because
of limited use of inputs and improved agricultural
technologies. The situation is further exacerbated by
the unreliability of rains: the uneven temporal and
spatial distribution of long rains undermines farmers’
efforts to produce a wide array of foods that would
be key for ensuring food security. In the same vein,
maize is often planted in lieu of other more climate
resilient crops in areas that are unsuitable for maize
cultivation such as the ranching zones found in Ganze,
Magarini and parts of Malindi resulting in crop failure
and directly affecting household food security.
About 65.5% of the population in Kilifi County is
literate (GoK, 2013), with a gender bias favouring
men’s educational achievement. Access to education
is affected by the distance that students must travels to
school: 65% of primary schools and 72% of secondary
schools are located more than 5 kilometers away
from students’ homes (GoK, 2013). This complicates
students’ access to basic education and their ability to
empower themselves socio-economically.
Most livelihoods in Kilifi County are based on crop
and livestock farming. The main food crops include
maize, cowpeas, green grams, and cassava, while the
main cash crops are coconuts, cashew nuts, sisal,
mangoes, and pineapple. Cash crops are typically
cultivated in Kilifi South, Kilifi North, Malindi, Kaloleni,
Rabai and Magarini. The main livestock include cattle
(Zebu), goats, sheep, poultry and beekeeping. Most
of the livestock are indigenous breeds. Fishing is also
an important livelihood activity for more than 5,000
families with an annual catch of about 443,689 tonnes
(GoK, 2013) (Annex 1).

Kilifi County
Agricultural land in Kilifi comprises 689,120 ha,
representing 55% of the County’s total land area. The
area under food crops and cash crops is 52,519 ha
and 47,681 ha respectively, 7.5% and 6.9% of the total
agricultural land (GoK, 2013). The rest of the land
remains idle or underutilized most of the time.
Four agro-ecological zones (AEZs) can be identified in
the county as follows (Jaetzold et.al., 2010):

The Coconut-Cassava zone, also referred to as
Coastal Lowland zone (CL3), has the highest potential
for crop production with precipitation of 1,300 mm
per annum and mean annual temperature of 24oC.
The altitude ranges from 1-450m above sea level.

The Cashew nut-Cassava zone, also referred
to as Coastal Lowland zone (CL4), has an average
precipitation of 900 mm and annual mean temperature
of 24oC. The zone has similar crop types like the
medium potential zone (CL3) but with less production.
In between the above two zones, there is the Coconut-
Cashew nut-Cassava zone that has the potential for
the crops grown in both the Coconut-Cassava zone
and the Cashew nut-Cassava zone.

The Lowland Livestock-Millet zone, also
referred to as Coastal Lowland zone (CL5), is of lower
agricultural potential with precipitation of 700-900mm
and temperatures of 27.0-25.2oC. The area is suitable
for dry land farming especially drought tolerant crops
and livestock ranching.

The Lowland Ranching zone, also referred to
as Coastal Lowland zone (CL6), varies in altitude of
90-300m with a mean annual temperature of 27oC
and annual precipitation of 350-700mm. The major
activities include ranching and wildlife.
Other important commodities include the African
Bird’s Eye chilli - mostly found in the drier parts of
Ganze, Magarini, Malindi, and Kilifi North - in CL3,
CL4 and CL5 due to its drought tolerant nature, and
livestock (beef), which provides food and income in
areas such as Ganze, Langobaya and Magarini found
mainly in the livestock-millet zone which are also the
Agricultural activities
ranching zones. For dairy, the main areas are found
along the coastline, including Kilifi South, Kilifi North,
Malindi, Rabai and parts of Kaloleni found in coconut-
cassava zone (CL3 and CL4). Poultry farming is found
virtually everywhere in the County.
Rain-fed agriculture is the predominant form of
farming and only 2% of the farmers in Kilifi County use
irrigation water. There is high irrigation potential along
the River Sabaki, which crosses the County as it drains
into the Indian Ocean. Small-scale farming is the
predominant production system, and farms average
about 3 ha (small scale) to 8 ha (large scale). About
66% of the County’s households do not possess land
titles, which discourages them from making long-term
investments in the land. Landlessness also contributes
to high poverty levels throughout the County (GoK,
2007). On the other hand, 41% of the female farmers
in the County have access to, and ownership of, land
for production, which they leverage to secure credit for
investing in agricultural technologies.
Aside from land, few other inputs are used by crop and
livestock farmers in Kilifi. Farmers mainly use organic
manure and field pesticides. Factors such as the lack
of access to basic needs (water, electricity, education)
and resources (incomes), as well as high input prices,
limited extension coverage, and prohibitively long
travel distances to input outlets prevent farmers from
investing in inputs. This has seriously hindered crop
productivity in the County.
There is a broad diversity of agricultural production
systems in the County of Kilifi. Various value chains
have been prioritized for development interventions
by different government organizations and programs,
such as the Agricultural Sector Development Support
Programme (ASDSP), the Kenya Agricultural and
Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) and
University of Nairobi survey, and the Kenya Agricultural
Productivity Program (KAPP). For the development
of this County Climate Risk Profile, four major Value
Chain Commodities (VCCs) were selected for in-depth
analysis, based on their productivity characteristics,
contribution to food security, and importance to the

Agricultural value chain commodities in Kilifi
economy. These VCCs have been selected from a list
compiled from documents of the above-mentioned
institutions, using the following prioritization indicators:
harvested area (hectares), production (90 kg bags),
variation in production (in the past five years), value
of production (US$/bag), dietary energy consumption
(Kcal/ capita/ day), protein content (gr of protein/
100 gr of product), iron content (mg of iron / 100
gr of product), zinc content (mg of zinc / 100 gr of
product), and Vitamin A content (IU Vitamin A / 100 gr
of product). The VCCs selected are: cassava, African
Bird’s Eye chilli, local poultry, and dairy cattle.
Cassava is a key staple food and livelihood source for
Kilifi´s population and is grown on 5,779 ha (0.8% of
the County’s agricultural land). Cassava is mostly grown
by women, who lead activities from land preparation
to harvesting. Production has risen incredibly fast in
recent years, from 137,938 tons in 2012 to 207,060
tons in 2014. In terms of productivity, yields in 2014
reached 35.8 ton per hectare up from 16.4 tons per
hectare realized in 2012 (GoK, 2015).
Cassava
In the past years, KALRO has been supporting the
dissemination of improved cassava cuttings amongst
farmers, hence facilitating increases in yields. In terms
of post-harvest activities, most farmers dry the cassava
and store it in their households for future use, while
others add value by chipping, frying, and packaging
it to produce crisps that are sold in urban centers and
supermarkets. Dried cassava can be milled to produce
flour that is used by families to prepare porridge or
Ugali.
The African Bird’s Eye Chilli, or ABEC crop was
introduced in Kilifi as a climate change adaptation
strategy, because of its high resistance to drought
and as an income-generating alternative, largely due
to its potential for processing and export. The income
earned from the chillies indirectly contributes to
household food security..
The ABEC crop is promoted by Equator Kenya
Ltd., a company located in Malindi town, which also
provides farmers with inputs (seeds and fertilisers),
African Bird’s Eye chilli

Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series
extension services, and secure markets. The company
collects the harvested chillies from the farmers for
processing and marketing, ensuring that they adhere
to the standards for export and certification schemes.
Currently, the company has contracted about 8,000
small-scale farmers, 80% of whom are women. The
company handles 75% of the total ABEC production,
while 25% is sold to other small-scale traders through
the cooperative movement (Kilifi ABEC). The export
company has its extension staff on the ground,
providing the necessary support to the farmers in all
these activities. Initially, the chillies were harvested
only five months per year, however, by introducing
drip irrigation kits to the farmers on a credit basis, the
harvest period has doubled to ten months per year.
Women engaged in ABEC farming have organized
themselves into groups to provide affordable labour,
taking turns in working on group members´ chilli
farms.
Poultry keeping is common among all households in
Kilifi and is practiced semi-intensively (free range and
chicken-holding structures). The majority of poultry
farmers are women, as men tend to be more engaged
in cattle farming. In 2015, there were about 998,600
poultry in the County (GoK, 2015). Farmers formulate
the chicken feeds by mixing fishmeal, sand, and grains
(mostly maize) and use prophylactic practices such as
vaccination to protect poultry against diseases such
as Newcastle and Gumboro. They have also formed
groups to facilitate the buying and selling of feeds and
to organize marketing. Local poultry take approximately
4 months before they are ready for the local market.
Farmers sell the chicken to traders (who bulk them
and transport to Mombasa town) or consume them
in the household, given the important protein content
founds in eggs and meat. Income from the sale of
chicken and eggs is also used to purchase food that
the farmers do not produce on their farms, supporting
food security.
Dairy farming is mainly practised along the County’s
coastline, including Kilifi South (CL3 and CL4), Kilifi
North(CL3 and CL4), Malindi(CL4), Rabai and parts
of Kaloleni (CL3 and CL4). Most dairy farmers are
Agricultural sector challenges
small holders who own on average 3 ha of land and
three animal heads per household. In 2015, there
were about 51,518 heads of dairy cattle in Kilifi
(GoK, 2015). Average milk production is between
3-7 litres per day per cow. Dairy farming contributes
to the food and nutrition security of households as
most milk is produced for home consumption. Small
additional income is sometimes obtained from selling
extra milk: the value of milk sales in Kilifi County
was about KSh 1.14 billion in 2012 (GoK, 2014).
Kilifi is among the poorest counties in Kenya3 with an
absolute poverty rate of 71.7% (GoK, 2007). Factors
that contribute to the entrenchment of extreme poverty
include the limited uptake of technology, especially in
the agricultural sector, and limited access to education
and training. Both of these factors contribute to the
limited or non-use of inputs and the perpetuation of
poor farming practices, which ultimately result in low
productivity and the overuse of natural resources. The
County’s arid zone is a major source of charcoal for
the towns of Mombasa, Malindi, Kilifi and Mtwapa.
Deforestation caused by the uncontrolled felling of trees
has led to widespread destruction of the environment.
This is a major contributor to soil degradation which
is rampant in the County since the lands do not have
adequate soil cover to protect against erosion. Poor
soils cause low crop productivity due to the lack of soil
nutrients that support plant growth.
Low productivity is directly tied to poor soil quality,
insufficient rainfall, and high incidence of pests and
diseases. Moreover, production costs are high, given
the high costs of inputs. Poor road networks and weak
market structures challenge market accessibility and
create important disincentives to production. Low
coverage of extension services is another challenge to
farming in the County. Government departments are
understaffed and under-resourced and are unable to
provide demand-driven services to the entire County.
This, in turn, has adverse effects on farmers’ capacity
to improve agricultural productivity, as farmers lack
information to make  informed decisions on planting
time, varieties, input use, and on coping with rainfall.

The two RCPs, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, are named after a possible range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values (+2.6 and +8.5 W/m2, respectively).
The pathways are used for climate modelling and research. They describe two possible climate futures, considered possible depending on how much greenhouse gases are
emitted in the years to come. RCP 2.6 assumes that global annual GHG emissions (measured in CO2-equivalents) peak between 2010 and 2020, with emissions declining
substantially thereafter. In RCP 8.5, emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century.7	 Refers to the wettest 1-day event (mm/day) indicator in the infographic.
Climate change and variability: historic
and future trends
Climate change and agriculture
risks and vulnerabilities
Kilifi County has a moderately hot and dry climate
throughout the year. The average temperature is greater
than 23°C throughout the majority of the county, with
areas along the coast generally above 25°C annually.
There is a strong east to west gradient of decreasing
precipitation with eastern (coastal) parts of the country
receiving greater than 1000 mm of precipitation per
year, while a majority of the county central to west
around 500-750 mm. Some small areas along the
western side receiving less than 500 mm precipitation
per year. As such, heat stress, dry spells, and drought
are hazards that strongly contribute to agricultural risk
in the county, especially in the central and western
parts of the county. However flooding due to intense
rains has also occurred historically and as such is a
risk to the county, especially in the central to eastern
parts (including the coast) of the county.
Experts and farmers alike acknowledge that there has
been significant changes and variations in climatic
conditions over the past years, affecting agricultural
production and livelihoods in the County. Historically,
dry spells, moisture stress, and intense precipitation
have occurred during both growing seasons of the year.
Moisture stress and dry spells were observed to occur
with approximately the same frequency during both
growing seasons, with approximately 65 consecutive
days of moisture stress in each season. However, there
has been an increasing trend in moisture stress in the
first wet season (January-June) since 1981, which
has not occurred as strongly during the second wet
season. Historic records show the first wet season
more consistently experienced single days with higher
precipitation, with more than 30mm falling in a single
day during 8 years 1981-20154 However, the second
wet season (July – December) experienced greater
variability in extreme precipitation with most years
below 20 mm precipitation in any single day, and only
three years with a day above 30mm. But the second
season had the two highest single days on record
since 1981, with over 40 mm of precipitation falling
on a single day in 2006, and over 50 mm falling on a
single day in 1996.
Climate has already been observed to change in
the county. Since 1981, the first wet season has
experienced a very high (2.0ºC) increase in mean
temperature and associated reduction in crop cycle,
a significant increase in heat stress days, and a strong
trend for decreasing precipitation (on the order of
20%). The combination of increased temperatures
and decreased precipitation make for an increase
in drought risk in this first wet season. The second
wet season experienced a mild (~0.5oC) increase in
temperature, and no change in precipitation.
Looking to the future in the years of 2021-2065, both
extreme precipitation and prolonged moisture stress
are projected to occur, but the changes are different
during different seasons. Within 30 years (by the early
2040’s) temperature is projected to increase by 0.5ºC,
with the first wet season projected to experience even
greater changes. And by this time, precipitation is
projected to decrease by 13% in the first wet season,
and 2% in the second wet season. Consecutive days
of moisture stress is projected to increase in both
seasons, from around 65 days per season to over 75
days of moisture stress. At the same time, increased
extreme precipitation is projected to occur slightly
during the second season, with the highest single day
of precipitation increasing on the order of 10-20%.
The first wet season is projected to experience a slight
decrease in the single day greatest precipitation on
the order of 10%. These projections of future climate
change under the two climate scenarios5 —RCP 2.6
and RCP 8.5—show some difference, with the climate
change patterns described above being slightly greater
with higher greenhouse gas concentrations.

10 Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series
Climate from the farmers’ perspective:
From the farmer’s point of view, one of the most
obvious indications of changing climatic conditions in
the past few years is the systematic delay in the onset
of rains: the first rains now tend to fall in April, whereas
before they began in March. This, in their opinion, has
brought about much uncertainty regarding planting
times. Even when rains do come on time, they do not
last long enough so as to enable the crops to mature.
These days, they say, maize rarely grows to maturity
and even where it does mature, yields are very low.
This has obliged farmers to shift to other crops such
as cassava, millet, sorghum and chilli. Farmers in Kilifi
also perceive changes in the amount, duration, and
intensity of rainfall: rains have a shorter duration (a few
weeks instead of an entire rainy season – for instance
this year (2016) there was rainfall only in the month of
April and no rainfall in May and June as is normally the
case – and are of increased intensity, affecting harvests
and ultimately compromising household food security.
As a consequence, farmers tend to spend less time
on their fields and resort to looking for alternative, off-
farm employment.
Changes and variations in climate have had important
social consequences. For instance, the  failed rains of
2016 resulted in total crop failure in ranching zones
like Magarini and Bamba (CL5 zones) while in the
areas along the coastline such as Kilifi North (CL3 and
CL4), Kilifi South (CL3 and CL4) and Malindi (CL4)
which only received rainfall in the month of April, only
30% of the normal harvest was realized. Women have
to travel long distances taking up to an hour in search
of water due to drying up of water reservoirs, whereas
men spend more time moving with livestock in search
of pastures and water. Men move from areas like
Magarani (e.g. Adu) where there are ranches to areas
along the coastline like Madunguni in Malindi to feed
their livestock with pastures that are available. These
changes have caused instability in families and social
disturbance, as men venture out to look for off-farm
income sources in urban centres and women remain
in the household, engaging in unsustainable activities
such as charcoal burning. Additionally, high school
drop-out rates have increased as children (especially
girls) are forced to abandon class in order to help their
families in their search for food, which is related to the
uncertainty created by these climatic events and their
direct impacts of food and livelihood insecurity.
Cassava production is mainly affected by drought
and flood hazards, which in turn cause supply deficits
and the loss of livelihoods. Droughts occur mainly in
Magarini (CL5), Ganze (CL4), and Kaloleni (CL4) and
affect the crop through poor germination rates or no
germination at all because of the lack of soil moisture.
For the cassava that manages to germinate, the roots
are relatively small, compared to the ones that are grown
under normal weather conditions. During droughts,
high evapotranspiration leads to the hardening of
soils, hindering land preparation, delaying planting,
and challenging harvesting. On the other hand, floods
that occur along the Sabaki River and in Kurawa and
Kaloleni cause rotting of the cassava seeds and roots,
due to excess moisture. The resulting tubers are of
poor quality and are likely to develop aflatoxins when
stored. The effects of these risks are disproportionately
borne by women and youth.
The production of ABEC is also affected by floods and
droughts. Droughts cause low germination rates of
the chillies. Many of the seedlings that germinate dry
up due to lack of soil moisture and exposed roots or
grow to produce small-sized chillies. During drought
conditions, little or no transplanting is done. Fertilisers
may burn the seeds when there is low moisture content
in the soils. Farmers are also sometimes confronted
by poor market supply of the chillies and no export
markets due to compromised production quality.
Women are most vulnerable to the consequences of
droughts and floods on chilli production as they rely
on the crop for seasonal incomes.
Droughts and floods also affect local chicken
production. During drought events, there is an
increase in poultry feed prices as a result of feed
scarcity, as human food needs compete with poultry
feed needs for grains. Aside from suboptimal feeding
that results in underweight animals, chickens face
the immediate threat of being washed away in floods,

The risks posed by climate change have forced farmers
in Kilifi to adopt various strategies to mitigate and
cope with their changing environment while striving
to maintain food and livelihood security. Some of the
most important on-farm adaptation strategies are

compromising household food security and incomes.
Chicken farmers in Magarini (CL5) and Ganze (CL4),
especially women and youth, remain highly vulnerable
to climate impacts on poultry production, given their
scarce resources to buy the feeds and lack of access
to vaccines.
Dairy cattle are highly sensitive to climate change
related risks, especially drought. Drought results in little
or no pasture and poor quality forages as well as scarce
water resources, which are key for cattle production.
Poor pasture conditions increases dairy animals´
susceptibility to diseases, which can eventually lead to
death. Water is a critical nutrient  for dairy cattle and
drought contributes to the dearth of water. Additionally,
high temperatures contribute to incidences of milk
spoilage. Floods also causes increased incidence
of diseases due to the wet conditions. For example,
during floods, dairy cattle  can get infected by worms
that are found in flooded waters.
The groups that are most vulnerable to these threats
are small-scale dairy farmers with on average three
animals or less per household, who have low capacity
to invest in inputs such as feed supplements,
concentrates, vaccines, artificial insemination, and
veterinary services. The regions most affected are
situated along the coastline, including Kilifi South
(CL3 and CL4), Kilifi North (CL3 and CL4), and Malindi
promoted as a strategy to mitigate drought risks. This
is practised in all the AEZs except the arid zone. This
include the coconut-cassava zone (CL3), cashew nut -
cassava zone (CL4), livestock-millet zone(CL5) and the
coconut - cashew nut- cassava (CL3 and CL4) zones.
Additionally, farmers in Kilifi have introduced short-
maturity crops such as: pulses-cow and pigeon peas;
green grams; and dryland hybrid maize (PH4, DH04,
DH02). These crops are able to reach maturity in
spite of the low availability of rainwater during planting
season. The introduction of these drought resistant
crops is supported by organizations such as the FAO,
WV, and the KRC, who provide small-scale farmers
(mostly women) with certified seeds, farm implements,
fertilisers and extension services. This is practised in the
zones which include the coconut-cassava zone (CL3),
cashew nut - cassava zone (CL4), livestock-millet zone
(CL5) and the coconut - cashew nut - cassava zones
(CL3 and CL4).
The most severe consequence of drought is lack of
water. On-farm interventions in Kilifi are mostly geared
towards methods of harvesting or conserving water
to boost crop production and improve pastures.
These interventions commonly include: water pans,
drip irrigation for chillies, zai-pits for trees, negarims
for cereals, ridges, semi-circular bunds for pasture,
and sunken beds for vegetables. Dairy farmers have
established water harvesting techniques such as water
pans to enable access to water in the event of drought.
These are practised in all the four AEZs found in Kilifi
County.
On-farm tree planting and the establishment of
woodlots is another adaptation technology undertaken
by farmers in Kilifi. Farmers have established nurseries
to provide a supply of tree seedlings to be planted
on farms to supply shade for pastures, crops, and
animals. Mangoes and paw paws are most common
fruit trees, while Casuarina is the most recommended
forest tree species due to its potential to rehabilitate
degraded lands. Trees improve the microclimate and
ameliorate the environment. The main challenge to
adoption of this strategy is the availability of the seed
supply for establishing and maintaining the nursery.
This adaptation is practised in coconut-cassava zone,
cashew nut - cassava zone and coconut - cashew nut
- cassava zones.

Kilifi County
NDMA generates, consolidates, and disseminates
information on drought management and climate
change adaptation through the Revise Early Warning
& Analysis System (REWAS) initiative. The system
provides credible early warning information on
drought risks and coordinates action across sectors
and agencies at all stages of the drought cycle, at
both national and county level. The NDMA publishes
monthly bulletins communicating current drought
Off-farm services
Soil conservation practices such as minimum tillage,
adequate soil cover, and crop rotation are being
introduced to farmers by FAO as a strategy to mitigate
the effects of drought by preventing excessive soil
water loss through evapotranspiration and soil erosion.
Crop rotation helps control crop diseases, insects, and
weeds, thus improving productivity. Although these
measures are practiced by 71% of Kilifi’s farmers,
limited County coverage of extension services and
lack of financial resources to implement some of
these interventions bring about unsystematic adoption
(spatially, temporally, and in terms of resources) of this
strategy among farmers.
Fodder production and conservation is an adaptation
being promoted to address the challenge faced in
livestock production in the wake of droughts. Farmers
are encouraged to grow hay and conserve it for
future use by drying. Sorghum has been introduced
as an alternative fodder grass to napier because it
grows faster and requires less rain. Some progressive
farmers especially in the dairy systems have embraced
silage making to ensure a consistent supply of animal
feed. Stovers and crop residues which previously were
thrown away are now increasingly being collected,
conserved and kept for future use. Rearing drought
resistant indigenous cattle species and crossbreeding
of indigenous breeds (that helps increase the genetic
potential) are other strategies for increasing system’s
adaptive capacity to new climate conditions. Last
but not least, farmers receive alerts from relevant
departments and sell animals ahead of the critical
time of the drought hazard to avoid massive losses
occasioned by the hazards.
status to government departments and relevant
humanitarian agencies. This service helps planning
activities across the entire value chain.
Additionally, the NDMA carries out a food security
assessment on the basis of weather patterns (long and
short rains). The aim is to determine the population’s
vulnerability based on agricultural performance during
the seasons. The report is then used by government
and non-government actors to design interventions
that support vulnerable populations.
In response to climatic threats, farmers have formed
groups/cooperatives to facilitate the acquisition of
inputs, improve on-farm activities, transmit value-
adding information and support marketing. These
groups also help provide access to extension services,
enabling farmers to prepare for risks. This is evident in
the case of poultry farmers, cassava and chilli farmers.
The cooperatives are also engaged in bulking the
commodities in order to seek better market prices for
the farmers. For instance, KALRO has been providing
and facilitating the use of drought-tolerant cassava
varieties in Kilifi County.
As an alternative option, farmers have been seeking
off-farm employment opportunities such as fishing or
business or move to urban centres in search of jobs to
mitigate the climate variability risks. Kilifi with its ocean
shoreline has opportunities in the tourism sector for
the local population.

Adapting agriculture to changes and variabilities in climate:
strategies across major value chain commodities

18 Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series
discussed below and summarized in Annex 3.
Currently, Kilifi County is in the process of creating
or adopting climate risk management policies that
can address some of the major challenges faced by
farmers and some of the informational, institutional,
and resource shortcomings that compromise their
ability to respond to these challenges.
The National Livestock Policy (2008) seeks to create
a favourable environment for the private sector to
thrive by creating mechanisms for capacity building,
supervision, regulation and improved access to
market information. This policy prioritizes actions
such as breeding, nutrition and feeding, value addition
and marketing, disease control, and research and
extension. Additionally, it provides good opportunities
for encouraging the adoption of climate adaptation
practices, for example through breeding programmes
that share information about animal genetic resources
including those better adapted to climate conditions.
Already there are efforts on the ground in the County
to support the conservation of feed, the improvement
of local breeds through selective breeding, and the
establishment of pastures through pasture re-seeding.
The Arid and Semi-Arid Lands Policy - ASALs (2007)
aims to revitalise ASALs by sporting livelihood
opportunities in the drylands. The policy acknowledges
pastoralism as a legitimate and productive livelihood
and aims for the coherent development of the ASALs
through the provision of basic services (health,
education, and infrastructure) and the decentralization
of strategic planning on livelihood diversification,
community participation, and drought early warning
systems. ASALs are the most vulnerable to impacts of
climate change and variability, thus the policy works
to provide ASAL-specific linkages between adaptation
and development agendas.
The National Irrigation Policy - draft (2014) aims to:
expand land under irrigation; increase agricultural
water harvesting and storage capacities; promote
water harvesting, use of wastewater, and exploitation
of groundwater for irrigation; build capacity for the
generation and utilization of irrigation research,
innovation, and technology, and; promote and adopt
an integrated approach to sustainable commercial
irrigation farming. Under this policy, there have been
concerted efforts to promote drip irrigation and various
forms of water harvesting such as establishment of
water pans, Negarims, roof water harvesting and
storage tanks.
Based on the vulnerability assessments mentioned
previously, the NMDA is implementing the Cash for
Assets program, which entails the transfer of cash to
most vulnerable farmers who, in return, establish an
asset that is used to mitigate climate change risks.
NMDA also provides support to the vulnerable farmers
participating in this Cash for Assets program in terms
of non-food items such as wheelbarrows and mattocks
that are used in the establishment of the assets. This
program is also aimed to address water by facilitating
the establishment of water pans, zai pits, sunken beds
and Negarims for crop production. Challenges to this
intervention are linked to limited human and financial
capacity to ensure full coverage within the County.
KACCAL has introduced interventions (technologies)
within the beekeeping, Local poultry, dairy cow and
ABEC value chains to increase resilience to climate
change effects. KACCAL provided inputs and extension
services for demonstrating the various technologies.
It is mostly the small-scale farmers with limited
alternative income-generating options that benefit
from these interventions. Some farmers also tend to
develop dependency syndrome whereby they expect to
be given all the time rather than working towards being
independent of the donors in terms of being supplied
with things like inputs every now and then. The Kenya
Cereals Enhancement Programme - Climate Resilient
Agricultural livelihoods Window (KCEP-CRAL) is a
new initiative by the government aimed at increasing
rural households’ resilience to climate change
and thus help reduce poverty and food insecurity.
The programme is expected to benefit Small-holder
farmers including women-headed households and
young people whose livelihoods depend on maize,
sorghum, millet and associated cereals. Another
initiative is farming the Gods way led by the Anglican
services of Kenya. This is a church based initiative
dedicated
to
conservation
and
restoration
of
biodiversity  with agriculture being one of the critical
sectors of interest. Agricultural productivity is declining
due to climate change among other factors causing
food insecurity and environmental degradation. This
is done through organizing farmers training that seek
to address biodiversity conservation and increase food
production. Forums are organized for sharing various
experiences the different communities have undergone.
The Kipepeo project is a forest butterfly farming
initiative which aims to provide alternative to farmers
who raise butterfly pupae for export. This deters
the farmers from clearing the forest for farmland.
Policies and Programmes

Kilifi County
Governance and institutional
resources
Climate risk management and adaptation strategies
in Kilifi are implemented mainly through the
collaboration between various actors, both state
and non-state. Amongst the most influential are
the state actors, including the line ministries and
departments such as; the Agriculture, Livestock and
Fisheries Department; the Kenya Meteorological
Department (KMD); Kenya Agriculture and Livestock
Research Organization (KALRO); the Kenya Forestry
Service (KFS), together with its research arm the
Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI); Water
Department; ASDSP;  Academic institutions such as
Pwani University; and government parastatals such as
NDMA and the National Environmental Management
Authority (NEMA).
The
non-state
actors
and
non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) include WV, KRC, the UN’s
World Food Programme (WFP), Kilifi Charcoal Burners
Association and FAO. Government departments mainly
provide technical support and policy direction while
non-state actors provide the research, funding, and
implementation for the adaptations. The collaboration
is largely coordinated through a stakeholder’s
forum that is responsible for planning climate risk
management.

In Kilifi County, NDMA is the key player that spearheads
climate risk management by serving as convener of the
stakeholders’ meetings and bringing together key state
and non-state actors. The main mission of the NDMA
is to ensure that drought does not bring about famine
in its areas of operation in the arid and semi-arid lands
of Kenya. This is accomplished through a number of
strategies, but most importantly by providing early
warning systems. At the stakeholders’ meetings, the
convened actors assess the County’s situation based
on the early warning system provided by the NDMA.
They then decide upon the best course of action to
bring about the desired solutions and apportion each
actor a task to perform based on their capacity and the
financial resources at their disposal. The assessment is
done for both the long and the short rains and in case
of any other emergency. The NGOs have a great deal
of influence in the implementation process due their
financial muscle. Community-based organizations
are normally incorporated in implementation phase
of adaptation since they are grassroots organizations
that are more able to influence the farmers within their
mandate.
Even with preparatory stakeholder meetings, the great
majority of the climate risk management in the County
is reactive as opposed to proactive; actions are taken
to reduce damages incurred instead of looking ahead
to prevent them. Government departments have
neither climate risk management sub-departments nor
specific budgets assigned to climate risk management,
even though most of their activities play an important
role in addressing climate threats and hazards. As for
the NGOs, their activities are often prescribed by their
project or program plans, which are often locked-
in and not easily modified or altered throughout the
longevity of their implementation. Inclusion of climate
risk management must be included from the start of
the project, or it is unlikely to be added to any real
extent until the periodic assessment phases, if at all.
Even though there is a good deal of collaboration
among the various stakeholders mentioned above,
currently, there is not an institutionalized framework for
structuring and organizing the collaborations between
actors. This lack of structured interaction contributes
to a lack of accountability on the part of the actors.
The integration of climate risk management efforts in
Kilifi is further complicated by the ongoing process of
domesticating national policies and adapting them
for the county level, as is happening nation-wide.
Inadequate funding and limited human capacity are
the bane of climate risk management: these factors
affect each phase of intervention, from planning to
implementation, and thus should be considered core
issues when addressing climate adaptation efforts.
Crucially, the various organizations involved in climate
risk management must share information with
one another to avoid the duplication of efforts and
improve efficiency in the delivery and implementation
of initiatives. Relatedly, the various stakeholders
involved in climate risk management should receive
in-depth training on the topic, including training
and capacity building across institutions to mutually
reinforce one another’s skills, to enhance their skills in
analysing and strategizing adaptations. There is also
need for adequate monitoring and evaluation of the
interventions that are underway and planned in order
to improve the efficiency of implementation and ensure
that future project build on the existing successes and
avoid the common pitfalls of previous interventions.
These types of collaborations, knowledge sharing,
and reflection should be carried out through inclusive
processes such as forums that bring together relevant
actors and interactions with climate risk management
actors in other sectors or counties to support the cross-
pollination of ideas and potentially the disbursement
of funds and resources.

20 Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series
Drought and flooding incidences are already visible
and are projected to increase in the near future in Kilifi
and therefore it is imperative that the farmers’ capacity
to cope with these conditions is enhanced. This calls
for both short-term and long-term adaptations that
target value chains that are key for the population’s
food security and livelihoods for both livestock and
crop systems.
Various measures to increase the resilience of farmers
in Kilifi are ongoing. This include on-farm practices
such as planting drought-tolerant varieties, crop
diversification, construction of water pans, Zai pits,
Negarims, sunken beds aiming at water and soil
conservation, drip irrigation, mulching, crop rotations,
agroforestry systems, drought-resilient animal breeds.
To complement the on-farm services, there are off-
farm activities such as the early warning information
and extension services to prepare and advise farmers
on how to manage the risks. Other farmers have
formed groups that provide cheap agricultural labour
to each other.
As farmers continue to implement the on-farm
initiatives, taking cognizance of the entire value chain
activities is crucial since all activities are affected
by climate change and variability. Farmers cannot
produce without having the recommended inputs
at the required time and therefore timely access of
inputs is vital. Equally important is the handling of the
produce after harvesting and subsequent marketing.
Farmers have been known to get bumper harvests
only for the same farmers to incur heavy post-harvest
losses occasioned by excessive rains during harvesting
and poor storage. Recommended inputs should be
made available at the right time through availability of
more input outlets. Extension services are essential for
supporting farmers in investing in technologies that
improve crop and livestock productivity and prevent
post-harvest loses.
Improvements in road infrastructure are also key to
ensure that the produce reaches the market timely
and in good quality. Moreover, most of the agricultural
produce is sold in raw form and have a degree of
perishability and therefore value addition will come in
handy to reduce losses, increase shelf-life and increase
the income earned from the produce.
The River Sabaki creates a high irrigation potential in
the County, offering opportunities for the expansion of
the agricultural sector. In the case of livestock, practices
related to fodder (hay) production and storage, which
can ensure a sustainable and stable supply, have
proven effective, and could be complemented with
improved productivity-oriented practices (such as
livestock crossbreeding), to ensure maximization of
benefits. Added to these, timely and accurate weather
forecasts would help actors along value chains take
informed decisions in their effort to adapt to changing
climate conditions.
Apart from these measures, the study highlights the
need to address the underlying factors that increase
farmers´ vulnerability to climate change and variability.
Investments in the provision of basic amenities such
as availability of and access to electricity, water and
education are required to empower farmers and
helping them take informed decisions on their farm
(use of inputs, interpreting weather information, etc.).
Moreover, basic services provide the population with
avenues to venture into other income-generating
activities that lift them out of poverty and enable
them to undertake longer-term investments in
agriculture. Alternative sources of income will curtail
the involvement of the populations in environmental-
degrading activities such as charcoal burning that
decimate the tree cover and contribute to climate
variability.
In terms of an enabling policy and institutional
environment, there is a need to scale-down national
policies to the County level, tailoring them to local
needs and resources available, so as to address
institutional and financial inadequacies that hinder
effective climate risk management.
