PREFACE
Climate change has evolved from being simply an environmental problem to a major development
challenge impacting all economic sectors. There is evidence from historical records that Kenya has
experienced increased temperature over the last 50 years. The frequency of intense extreme weather
events like droughts and floods has also increased. Future climatic predictions indicate a possible
temperature increase of 10C by 2020 and 2.30C by 2050.
The changes in climate and weather patterns will expose the rain-fed farming systems, especially
the arid and semi-arid lands, to more climate related vulnerabilities. This will predispose farming
communities to food insecurity and poverty through loss of the productive assets and the weakening
of coping strategies and resilience. On the other hand, the agriculture sector contributes to the
climate change problem through emissions arising from inefficiencies in crop, livestock, fisheries
and forestry production systems. These inefficiencies lead to greater levels of enteric fermentation
in livestock, poor manure and agro-based waste management systems, improper land preparation
systems, inefficient input and resource use in crop management systems as well as inefficiencies that
raise emissions from agro-based machinery.
The agriculture sector is a major contributor the economy of Kenya in terms of food security,
employment creation, supply of agrobased industry raw materials and foreign exchange earnings.
About 98% of Kenya’s agricultural systems are rain-fed and highly susceptible to climate change
and variability. This susceptibility is likey to jeopardize attainment of the sector contribution to the
national economy.
Innovative and transformative measures are therefore urgently required to assist stakeholders in the
sector across the agricultural value chains to cope with effects of current and projected change in
climate patterns. Climate smart agriculture (CSA) has been identified as a viable approach to provide
solutions towards increased agriculture sector productivity while addressing impacts of changing
climate. For the government to fully and effectively implement climate smart agriculture, sound and
enabling strategies that provide set goals and actions that promote investment must be in place.
The development of the climate smart agriculture is our collective effort and commitment to address
agriculture sector development under changing climatic conditions. The development of this strategy
has been highly consultative and participatory and involved stakeholders at county and national
levels. We urge all stakeholders to play their respective roles in ensuring this strategy is successfully
implemented to ensure continued sector growth while shielding it from the negative impacts of
climate change.
FOREWORD
Kenya envisions being a middle- income country with citizens enjoying high quality of life and a
sustained annual economic growth rate of at least 10% by the year 2030 according to the National
Development Blue Print “The Kenya Vision 2030”. The agriculture sector has been identified as
one of the key sectors to contribute to the projected annual national economic growth. The sector
is envisaged to ensure food security, provision of raw materials for agro-industries, creation of
employment opportunities, generation of income and foreign exchange earnings.
The sector is however the most vulnerable to impacts of climate change and extreme weather events.
Enhanced temperatures and change in precipitation regimes have led to reduced suitability of agro-
based enterprises; reduced productivity of crops, livestock and fisheries due to temperature and water
stresses; and rising production costs. The increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather
events such as droughts, floods and strong winds have led to loss of investments, incomes and
livelihoods, destruction of agro-based infrastructure as well as increased frequency of weather related
disasters. Due to these challenges, the government recognizes the need to develop interventions that
make agriculture more resilient to climate change and extreme weather events while minimizing its
contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.
Climate smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and
reorient agricultural systems to effectively support development and ensure food security in a changing
climate. CSA aims to achieve three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity
and incomes; adapting and building resilience to climate change; and reducing and/or removing
greenhouse gas emissions, where possible. These objectives form part of Kenya’s obligation as a
signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  Climate
smart agriculture is the pathway that leads to attainment of the national interests of food security,
productivity and incomes, while at the same time reducing or sequestering greenhouse gas emissions.
CSA provides the means to help stakeholders at local, national and international levels to identify
agricultural strategies suitable to their conditions. This Climate Smart Agriculture Strategy has been
developed to guide investments and implementation of activities in the context of the current agriculture
sector governance structure. I am optimistic that this Strategy will contribute to the achievement of
Vision 2030. I take this opportunity to request all the relevant stakeholders to play their respective
roles in ensuring the successful implementation of this Strategy for the well-being of all citizens.

The broad objective of the Kenya CSA Strategy (KCSAS) is to adapt to climate change, build resilience
of agricultural systems while minimizing emissions for enhanced food and nutritional security and
improved livelihoods. The specific objectives of the KCSAS are to (i) enhance adaptive capacity
and resilience of farmers, pastoralists and fisher-folk to the adverse impacts of climate change; (ii)
develop mechanisms that minimize greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production systems;
(iii) create an enabling regulatory and institutional framework; and (iv) address cross-cutting issues
that adversely impact CSA.
Four broad strategic areas have been identified for KCSAS: (i) Adaptation and building resilience
by addressing vulnerability due to changes in rainfall and temperature, extreme weather events and
unsustainable land/water management and utilization; (ii) Mitigation of GHG’s emissions from
key and minor sources in the agriculture sector; (iii) Establishment of an enabling policy, legal
and institutional framework for effective implementation of CSA; and (iv) Minimizing effects of
underlying cross-cutting issues such as human resource capacity and finance which would potentially
constrain realization of CSA objectives.
The coordination framework and implementation mechanism for KCSAS will be harmonized with
the inter-governmental coordination structure under development and near completion. This will
ensure clarity in flow of information, policy direction and funds. The implementation of this strategy
will be mainly by the County Governments.
The KCSAS is a tool to implement Kenya’s NDC contribution for the agriculture sector and will
require domestic and international support. The implementation of KCSA strategy will require a
total of KSh. 500 billion (US$ 5.0 billion) for adaptation and mitigation actions for agriculture sector
up to 2026. This will contribute to building resilience and adaptive capacity in the sector as well as
reducing sectoral emissions to 30 MtCO2e relative to the business as usual trajectory projection of
37 MtCO2e in 2026. Investment resources to implement the KCSAS will be mobilized from diverse
sources and appropriate mechanisms established for access, disbursement and utilization. The strategy
provides a detailed implementation framework with clear stakeholder roles and responsibilities. The
implementation framework also forms a basis for the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) framework.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Climate change is real and has become an impediment to sustainable development globally. Climate
change will have a range of positive and negative impacts in agriculture depending on the regions of
the world. The negative impacts are expected to be more adverse in developing countries, particularly
those in sub-Saharan Africa such as Kenya which has experienced increasing temperatures from
1960’s coupled with increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as El Niño and
La Niña. Effects of the negative impacts will include declining agricultural productivity and loss of
crops, livestock, fish and investments in agriculture due to changing temperatures and precipitation
regimes and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Further, fisheries and
aquaculture are affected through acidification of the water bodies, changes in water temperatures and
circulation patterns which alter the physico-chemical properties of the fish habitats and ultimately the
productivity.
Agriculture is not only impacted upon by climate change but also contributes to the problem. The
country’s agriculture is predominantly rain-fed and therefore vulnerable to climate change particularly
changes in temperature regimes and precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events. This leads
to, among others, unsustainable land and agricultural water management. Kenya’s greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions were estimated to be 73 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in
2010 and are expected to rise to 143 MtCO2e in 2030 unless appropriate mitigation actions are taken.
Agriculture is the largest source of GHG emissions; it was responsible for one-third of Kenya’s
total emissions in 2010. Agricultural emissions are likely to increase from 20 MtCO2e in 2010 to 27
MtCO2e by 2030, largely driven by livestock methane emissions and land use change, which account
for 90% of agriculture emissions and 30% of overall national emissions.
Weak polices, legislations, enforcement, and overlap of mandates among institutions involved in
regulation coupled with poor coordination and collaboration among institutions and stakeholders
in climate smart agriculture (CSA) have contributed to the country’s inability to effectively address
vulnerability and GHG emissions. Further, cross cutting issues such as inadequate financing of CSA
activities; limited capacity of Women, Youth, and Vulnerable Groups (WY&VG) to participate in
CSA activities; unsustainable natural resource management (NRM) and utilization; limited human
resource capacity to undertake CSA; limited CSA research technology development and innovations;
and inadequate data and information on CSA have also led to poor implementation of CSA activities.
The country requires transformation of its agricultural systems to make them more productive and
resilient while minimizing GHG emissions under a changing climate. CSA provides an excellent
opportunity for the transformation by uniting agriculture, development and climate change under a
common agenda through integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic,
social and environmental) by jointly addressing food security and climate challenges. CSA therefore
sustainably increases agricultural production and incomes, builds resilience of agricultural systems
to climate change and minimizes GHGs emissions. However existing national strategies and
interventions such as the National Climate Change Action Plan (2013-2017) and the Agriculture
Sector Development Strategy (2010-2020) have not adequately mainstreamed adaptation, building
resilience and mitigation of GHG’s into the agricultural sector. Consequently, the sector needs a
sound and enabling CSA strategy that will simultaneously guarantee productivity and food security
while addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation.

GLOSSARY/DEFINITION OF TERMS
Adaptation: Adjustment in agro-ecosystems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or
their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.
Agro-ecosystem: The organisms and environment of an agricultural area considered as an ecosystem.
Arid and Semi-Arid Lands: Areas characterized by inadequate precipitation, which constrains their
two major interlinked services of primary production and nutrient cycling.
Biodiversity: The total diversity of all organisms and ecosystems at various spatial scales (from
genes to entire biomass).
Capacity building: In the context of climate smart agriculture, it is the process of developing relevant
technical skills and institutional capability to enable effective addressing of the causes and effects of
climate change for the agriculture sector.
Carbon market: A trading system through which countries or other entities may buy or sell units
of greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to meet their national limits on emissions under various
protocols or other agreements. The term comes from the fact that carbon dioxide is the predominant
greenhouse gas, and other gases are measured in units called “carbon-dioxide equivalents.”
Carbon sequestration: The process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and depositing it in a
reservoir, such as the soil or trees.
Climate change: Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified
(e.g. by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that
persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural
internal processes or external forcing, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of
the atmosphere or in land use.
Climate-proofing: Ensuring that climate risks are reduced to acceptable levels through long-lasting
and environmentally sound, economically viable and socially acceptable changes implemented at one
or more of the stages in the project cycle.
Climate smart agriculture: Agriculture that sustainably increases productivity, resilience
(adaptation), reduces/removes greenhouse gases (mitigation), and enhances the achievement of
national food security and development goals.
Co-benefits: Multiple benefits in different fields resulting from one policy, strategy, or action plan.
Conservation Agriculture: An approach to managing agro-ecosystems for improved and sustained
productivity, increased profits and food security while preserving and enhancing the resource base
and the environment. It is characterized by three linked principles namely, continuous minimum
mechanical soil disturbance; permanent organic soil cover; and diversification of crop species grown
in sequences and/or associations.
Crop diversification: Species diversification through varied crop associations and/or rotations
(involving annual and/or perennial crops including trees).
Cross breeding: Cross breeding refers to the process of breeding an animal or plant with purebred
parents of two different breeds, often with the intention to create offspring or seedlings that share the
traits of both parent lineages, or producing an animal or plant with hybrid vigor.
Deforestation: The conversion of forest to another land use or the long-term reduction of tree canopy
cover below the 10% threshold.
Disaster risk management: The systematic process of using administrative directives, organizations,
and operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and improved coping capacities
in order to lessen the adverse impacts of hazards and the possibility of disaster.
Disaster risk reduction: The concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through systematic

technical literature and publishes assessment reports that are widely recognized as the most credible
existing sources of information on climate change. The IPCC also works on methodologies and
responds to specific requests from the UNFCCC’s subsidiary bodies.
In-vitro conservation of genetic resources: Conservation by cryopreservation of genetic material so
that living organisms can, if necessary, be regenerated in the future.
In-vivo conservation of genetic resources: Conservation of genetic material through maintenance
of living populations, which encompasses both in-situ conservation in their typical production
environment and ex-situ in-vivo conservation, in non-typical surroundings, such as a research farm.
Mitigation: In the context of climate change,  human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the
sinks of greenhouse gases e.g. using fossil fuels more efficiently or electricity generation, switching
to solar energy or wind power from fossil fuels for industrial processes and expanding forests and
other “sinks” to remove greater amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions: A set of government prioritized actions aimed at
reducing or limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
Payment for Ecosystem Services: An economic instrument designed to provide positive incentives
to users of agricultural land and those involved in coastal or marine management. These incentives
are expected to result in continued or improved provision of ecosystem services, which in turn, will
benefit society as a whole.
Public-Private Partnerships: Public-Private Partnerships are an association between government
and private sector through which private financing is utilized to perform a public function, at a profit
to the private sector.
Protocol: An international agreement linked to an existing convention, but as a separate and additional
agreement that must be signed and ratified by the Parties to the convention concerned. Protocols
typically strengthen a convention by adding new, more detailed commitments.
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus: Reducing Emissions
from Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus the role of conservation, sustainable management of
forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.
Reforestation: The re-establishment of forest formations after a temporary condition with less than
10% of canopy cover due to human-induced or natural perturbations.
Resilience: The ability of a system and its component parts to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or
recover from the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner.
Sensitivity (to climate variability or change): Sensitivity is the degree to which a system is affected,
either adversely or beneficially, by climate variability or change. The effect may be direct (e.g. a
change in crop yield in response to a change in the mean, range or variability of temperature) or
indirect (e.g. damages caused by an increase in the frequency of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise).
Sustainable development: Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Technology transfer: A broad set of processes covering the flows of know-how, experience and
equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change among different stakeholders.
Vulnerability: The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects
of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the
character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and
its adaptive capacity.
Watershed: A topographically delineated area that is drained by a stream system, i.e. the total land
area that drains to some point on a stream or river. The watershed is a hydrologic unit that has been
described and used as a physical-biological unit and a socio-economic-political unit for planning and
managing of natural resources.
efforts to analyze and manage the causal factors of disasters, including through reduced exposure to
hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of land and the environment
and improved preparedness for adverse events.
Disaster: A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread
human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the
affected community or society to cope using its own resources.
Drought: The phenomenon that exists when precipitation is significantly below normal recorded
levels, causing serious hydrological imbalances that often adversely affect land resources and
production systems.
Dry spell: Short period of water stress during critical crop growth stages and which can occur with
high frequency but with minor impacts compared with droughts.
Ecosystem resilience: The capacity of an ecosystem to absorb external pressure or perturbations
through change and re-organization, but still retain the same basic structure and ways of functioning.
Ecosystem services: Ecological processes or functions that have monetary or non-monetary value
to individuals or society at large e.g. Productivity or biodiversity maintenance; provisioning services
such as food, fibre, or fish; regulating services such as climate regulation or carbon sequestration; and
cultural services such as tourism or spiritual and aesthetic appreciation.
Ecosystem: The interactive system formed from all living organisms and their abiotic (physical and
chemical) environment within a given area.
Enteric fermentation: Enteric fermentation is a natural part of the digestive process for many
ruminant animals where anaerobic microbes, called methanogens, decompose and ferment food
present in the digestive tract producing compounds that are then absorbed by the host animal. A
resulting by-product of this process is methane.
Enteric methane: Methane gas emitted as a natural by-product of microbial fermentation of
carbohydrates and, to a lesser extent, amino acids in the rumen and the hindgut of farm animals.

economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food
preferences for an active and healthy life.
Greenhouse gases: The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climate
change. The major GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Less
prevalent but very powerful greenhouse gases are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons
(PFCs) and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).
Index-based insurance: An insurance product in which the insured in a specified geographical

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.1	BACKGROUND INFORMATION
1.1.1 The Agriculture Sector
Kenya’s agriculture is key to meeting the challenges of feeding a growing population, creating wealth,
reducing poverty and managing the degradation of natural resources. The agricultural sector continues
to be a key economic and social driver of development. Overall, the sector directly contributes about
25% of Kenya’s GDP and about 27% indirectly through linkages to agro-based industries and the
service sector. The sector accounts for over 65% of exports, provides about 75% of total employment
and supports over 80% of the rural population. The agricultural sector has four major sub-sectors,
namely, crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry.
The crops sub-sector is key to agricultural development and industrialization for the nation. Overall,
the crops sub-sector contributes 77.6% to the Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (AgGDP). The
sub-sector comprises industrial, food and horticultural crops. The main industrial crops in Kenya
include tea, coffee, sugarcane, cotton, sunflower, pyrethrum, barley, tobacco, sisal, coconut and bixa,
all of which contribute about 55% of agricultural exports. According to the Economic Survey Report
of Kenya (KNBS, 2014), industrial crops contributed 17.9% of the AgGDP in 2012.
The main food crops include cereals, pulses, roots and tubers, fruits and vegetables, all of which
contribute about 32% of the AgGDP and 0.5% of exports earning. Most cereal crops recorded
significant decline in production in the recent past. In the same period, performance of the crops sub-
sector was boosted by a higher output of paddy rice and wheat. Over the same period, production of
beans decreased while production of Irish potatoes improved significantly.
Horticulture is a critical sector in the country that has recorded a remarkable export-driven growth in
the past decade. It is now the largest sub-sector contributing about 33% of the AgGDP and 38% of
export earnings. The volume of fresh horticultural exports stood at 213.8 thousand tonnes in 2013.
Livestock plays an important economic and socio-cultural role among many Kenyan communities.
The major livestock resources include cattle, camel, poultry, sheep, goats, bees, emerging livestock
and their products. The national census of 2009 showed that Kenya’s animal resource base comprised
of 17.5 million cattle, 27.7 million goats, 17 million sheep, 3 million camels, 31.8 million domestic
birds, and 1.8 million donkeys (GoK, 2010a). About 60% of Kenya’s livestock herd is found in the
arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) which constitute over 80% of the country.
The livestock sub-sector contributes about 19.6% of the AgGDP and about 4.9% of Kenya’s Gross
Domestic Product (GDP). The sub-sector employs 50% of the agricultural labor force and is the main
source of livelihood to over 10 million Kenyans living in the ASALs. The sub-sector has the potential
to provide adequate supplies of all animal products to meet domestic food and nutrition needs and
generate surplus for export.

established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1989 to provide broad and
balanced information about climate change. The IPCC does this by reviewing and assessing the most
recent scientific, technical and socioeconomic information produced worldwide and relevant to the
understanding of climate change and translating this information into IPCC Assessment Reports.
As a follow-up to the work of Brundtland Commission, which is formally known as the World
Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development (UNCED), informally known as the Earth Summit was convened in
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 1992. The Summit sought to take stock of past development paths and
lay foundations for a new future economic development trajectory, one that would marry economic
needs with environmental concerns. From the Summit, the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) emerged along with the Conventions on Biodiversity, Desertification,
Agenda 21 and other major international environmental governance instruments and initiatives. A
total of 192 Member States signed and ratified the UNFCCC, and committed to arrest the growing
negative effects on climate by reducing emissions of GHGs which have a massive global warming
impact.
The UNFCCC and its subsidiary bodies, now states with certainty that the earth is warming, largely
spurred by human activities, and this will have many serious and potentially damaging effects in the
coming decades. This is captured in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, the scientific advisory
arm of the UNFCCC,  which states that ‘warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now
evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread
melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level.’
1.2 CLIMATE CHANGE AND AGRICULTURE
1.2.1 Global issues on Climate Change and Agriculture
There is wide scientific consensus that global climate is changing in part as a result of human activities
(IPCC, 2001) and that the social and economic costs of slowing it down and responding to its impacts
will be large (OECD, 2001). Current data demonstrates that the climate is changing globally at an
unprecedented rate and that unparalleled levels of human induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
especially carbon dioxide, are causing an increase in global temperatures that creates changes in the
earth’s weather. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have increased from a pre-industrial
value of 278 parts per million (ppm) to 379 ppm in 2005. It is now generally accepted that this climate
change is the result of increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other
GHGs in the atmosphere (IPCC, 2001).
Studies have shown that there has been a steady rise in average global temperature. The earth has
warmed by 0.74°C during the last 100 years. For example, the 1990s were about 0.6°C warmer
than the late 1890s. The 1990s were the warmest decade since the beginning of instrumental record-
keeping in 1860, and the warmest in the past thousand years on the basis of tree rings and other proxy
measurements. Moreover, there has been an increase in the number of heat waves and a reduction in
the frequency and duration of frosts in many parts of the world.
Climate change will have a range of positive and negative impacts on agriculture. It is generally
agreed that agricultural impacts will be more adverse in tropical areas than in temperate areas.
Developed countries will largely be beneficiaries: cereal productivity is projected to be higher in
Canada, northern Europe and parts of the former Soviet Union compared with what it would have
The fisheries sub-sector provides food, employment and incomes to a large population and earns the
country KSh. 5 billion annually from the foreign exchange. These earnings are likely to increase if
the under-exploited areas such as Aquaculture and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) are tapped.
The sub-sector directly employs at least 300,000 people working as fishers and fish farmers. It also
provides livelihoods for over 4 million Kenyans involved mainly in fish processing, fish trade and
input support.  Kenya’s fishing communities rely on fish as a rich source of protein. The country’s per
capita consumption stood at 4.5 kg/person/year in 2014. Overall, the sub-sector contributes about 2%
of AgGDP and 0.5% of national GDP. Kenya’s fisheries sub-sector is mainly composed of freshwater
(lakes, rivers and dams) and marine (Indian Ocean) sources with the rest coming from aquaculture.
Lake Victoria is the most important source of fish in Kenya and the biggest source of freshwater
fish in the country. The lake is also important in conservation terms because of its great biodiversity
of endemic fish species. The other lakes that are important sources of fish are Turkana, Naivasha,
Baringo and Jipe.
The main fish species of commercial importance from inland fisheries include Nile Perch, Tilapia,
Rastrineobola argentea (dagaa/omena), while marine species comprise of Tuna, Snappers and
Crustaceans. The national fish production in 2014 was about 187,000 MT valued at about KSh.32
billion (ex-vessel). Inland capture fisheries contributed about 124,000 MT (68%) of fish valued at
Ksh. 12 billion while marine capture fisheries contributed about 9,000 MT (27%) valued at Ksh. 18
billion in 2014.
Forestry and agriculture are closely linked, since agriculture is the major driver of deforestation
leading to forest loss. The forestry sub-sector contributes about 0.2% of AgGDP. Forest resources
provide important ecosystem services that include food, water and medicine; regulation of floods,
drought and land degradation; supporting soil formation and nutrient cycling; and cultural services
such as recreational, spiritual, religious and other non-material benefits.
1.1.2 Climate Change
Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. using statistical
tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended
period, typically decades or longer. It refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural
variability or as a result of human activity.
Scientists started providing anecdotal evidence of anthropogenic climate change from the late 19th
century but stronger evidence of human influence on global climate only emerged in the late 1950’s
when Keeling and others at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography began to measure the concentration
of carbon dioxide in ice-cores. The results of these studies showed that global carbon dioxide
concentrations were rising and linked the rise in concentration to an increase in global temperatures.
Carbon dioxide had been known then to have a greenhouse or warming effect, which is the inherent
ability to trap and retain infrared radiation.
The 1960s and 1970s saw heightened concerns over the global environmental change. These became
prominent in the 1980s with the release of the Brundtland Report (also commonly known as ‘Our
Common Future’) (Brundtland, 1987). The report alluded to various environmental concerns
including climate change and associated the change with increasing atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases (GHGs). Climate change was considered one of the undesirable consequences of
man’s unsustainable development practices. Concerned with this, two UN bodies; the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) jointly

These observed and anticipated changes in weather patterns and climate extremes threaten agricultural
production and food security which in turn undermines Africa’s ability to grow and develop. Regional
initiatives to respond to climate change include; the development of the East African Community
Climate Change Policy (EACCCP), Masterplan and Strategy, which also informs Kenya’s National
Climate Change Framework Policy. The EAC regional Climate Change Master Plan (2011-2031)
serves as the blue print to guide regional climate change response measures, in the long term.
1.2.3 National issues on Climate Change and Agriculture
Kenya’s economic indicators over the years show that growth in the agriculture sector is synonymous
to Kenya’s economic growth. Historically, development worldwide has been closely related to
greenhouse gas emissions due to unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, which contributes
to climate change. Having been reclassified in 2014 from a low-income economy to lower-middle-
income economy, there are clear indications that Kenya is developing, and therefore likely to increase
its emissions. To realize Kenya’s development vision as stated in the Kenya Vision 2030, “the low
carbon climate resilient development pathway” was set out in the National Climate Change Response
Strategy (NCCRS). This is meant to enhance development, make investments resilient to climate
change and extreme weather events while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, where possible.
In Kenya, data from the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) indicates changes in temperature
and rainfall over the last 50 years. From the early 1960s, Kenya has generally experienced increasing
temperatures over vast areas. Over inland areas, the trends in both minimum (night-time/early
morning) and maximum (daytime) temperatures depicts a general warming through time that has had
negative impacts on the scenic snow-cap of Mt Kenya that rises above the surrounding savanna and
can be seen from hundreds of kilometers away. Only 11 of the 18 glaciers that covered Mt Kenya’s
summit a century ago remain, leaving less than one third of the previous ice cover. The ice on Mt
Kenya has also become thinner. While this trend dates to the late 1800s, emerging evidence suggests
that it has accelerated since the 1970s due to climate change.
These changes in weather patterns and climate extremes are likely to jeopardize agricultural production
and food security and hence Kenya’s ability to grow and develop. For example, a temperatures rise
of 2°C would lead to large areas of Kenya currently suited to growing tea becoming unsuitable. This
would have an enormous impact on the tea industry which directly and indirectly employs three
million Kenyans or about 8% of the population.
In general, annual highest rainfall events indicate that the 24 hour intense rainfall amounts observed
in the recent years are relatively lower than those in the early 1960s; essentially, these values have
been reducing (negative trend) with time. These trends are also depicted in the time series of the
‘Long Rains’ season which contributes a significant amount of rainfall to annual totals over most
parts of the country. However, the changes (reductions) are not very significant. Most of the standard
seasons also depict the same type of patterns in the highest daily rainfall values observed. Thus
far, there is an indication of relatively more intense rainfall occurring more frequently. This causes
floods particularly in lakeshore and coastal counties leading to loss of life and crops, displacement of
households, and destruction of homes.
been in the absence of climate change. By contrast, a number of today’s poorest developing countries
are likely to be negatively affected (IPCC, 2001). In these countries, the next 50 to100 years will
see widespread declines in the extent and potential productivity of cropland (Fischer et al., 2007)
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Europe (Parry et al., 1999).
It is now clear that climate change has become an impediment to sustainable development globally
and urgent action is required. The UNFCCC recognizes these consequences and in Article 2 has called
on the world’s governments to take action aimed at reducing and stabilizing concentrations of GHGs
‘in the atmosphere at a level that would avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate
system.’ There is an opportunity based on the Paris Agreement 2015, for all nations of the world
to address the impacts of climate change and maintain a balance between increasing agricultural
productivity and environmental sustainability.
In the year 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. This has
seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs cover issues addressed in the Kenya
Vision 2030 (GoK, 2007). The goals relevant to agricultural development include; ending poverty,
hunger, ensuring healthy lives, achieving gender equality, ensuring availability and sustainable
management of water, access to clean energy, ensuring sustainable economic growth, fostering
industrialization and innovation, reduction of inequalities, promoting responsible consumption and
production, interventions on climate change, conservation of marine ecosystems, protection and
restoration of terrestrial ecosystems, promote partnership for goals.
1.2.2 Regional issues on Climate Change and Agriculture
African economies are highly dependent on agriculture. Arable land and permanent pasture occupy
one-third of the land area in Africa. Agriculture constitutes approximately 30% of GDP. It is estimated
that 75% of the African population resides in rural areas, and almost all of the rural labor force is
engaged in the production of crops, livestock, fisheries, and forestry.
Climate change is real, and is already affecting African agriculture. Between 1886 and 2012, global
average temperatures have risen by 0.85°C and this is reflected across all regions of sub-Saharan
Africa; and further increases of about 1.5°C by 2050 are almost certain. In 2013, Africa experienced
an overall hot year, the second warmest on record after 2010. Changes in current rainfall patterns are
less clear. However, a decline in precipitation has been observed in West Africa since the end of the
1960s, ranging from 20 to 40% between 1931 to 1960 and 1968 to 1990 (IPCC, 2007; Sissoko et al.,
2010). In a recent study, Fabusoro et al. (2014) found that in the sub-humid parts of Nigeria, the mean
monthly rainfall has been increasing by 65 mm/month/decade from 1982 to 2010. These changes
have contributed to prolonged and intensified droughts in eastern Africa; unprecedented floods in
western Africa; depletion of rain forests in equatorial Africa; and an increase in ocean acidity around
Africa’s southern coast.
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report indicates that annual rainfall is likely to decrease in much of
Mediterranean Africa and the Northern Sahara, with a greater likelihood of decreasing rainfall towards
the Mediterranean coast. On the other hand, rainfall in southern Africa is likely to decrease in much
of the winter rainfall region and western margins. There is likely to be an increase in annual mean
rainfall in East Africa, but it is unclear how rainfall in the Sahel, Guinean Coast and the Southern
Sahara will evolve.

During the Hague conference, it was recognized that food security and climate change have emerged
as possibly the two most significant global challenges over the coming decades, and therefore
described CSA as an approach to developing the technical, policy and investment conditions to
achieve sustainable agricultural development for food security under climate change. It contributes to
the achievement of national food security and development goals with three objectives; (i) sustainably
increase agricultural productivity and incomes; (ii) adapt and build resilience to climate change; and
(iii) minimize greenhouse gas emissions where possible.
1. 3 MISSION VISION AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Vision
A climate resilient and low-carbon growth sustainable agriculture that ensures food security and
contributes to national development goals.
Mission
To facilitate agriculture that sustainably increases productivity, enhances resilience and minimizes
greenhouse gas emissions.
Overall objective
The overall objective of this strategy is to build resilience and minimize emissions from agricultural
farming systems for enhanced food and nutritional security and improved livelihoods.
Specific Objectives
i.
To enhance adaptive capacity and resilience of farmers, pastoralists and fisher-folk to the
adverse impacts of climate change.
ii.
To develop mechanisms that minimize greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production
systems.
iii.
To improve coordination and collaboration among institutions and stakeholders in climate
smart agriculture.
iv.
To address cross-cutting issues that adversely impact or enhance CSA.
Guiding Principles
This Strategy is in accordance with the fundamental and operational principles across agricultural,
environmental and financial boundaries and innovative institutional arrangements. The implementation
of this Strategy will be guided by the following principles:
i.
Multi-dimensional, considering short, medium and long term: This strategy will, at every
stage, take into account global to local implications, as well as short, medium and long term time
scales.
ii.
Country and context specific: This considers the socio-economic, political, cultural and
environmental circumstances; the institutional and technological context; political will, resource
availability and mobility; social and political awareness, and overall capacity. The strategy
appreciates that there is not a single “perfect” approach, and the approach taken is informed by
principles of good practice and adapted based on specific circumstances and context.
iii.	 Intergovernmental and participatory: The strategy recognizes distinctiveness and inter-
dependence of the two levels of government in line with Kenya’s Constitution and the
Intergovernmental Relations Act, 2013. It has adopted a cross-sectoral approach which takes
advantage of potential synergies.
Changing rainfall patterns have effects on sustainability of water resources. For example, Lake
Victoria which is the world’s second largest freshwater lake and the largest lake in Africa is fed by
waters from Kagera, Mara and Sondu catchments which accounts for 20% of the lake’s water, while
the remaining 80% is from direct rainfall (Awange et al., 2008). The Basin provides livelihoods for
about a third of the combined population of the three countries that share the lake’s waters. In the 105-
year history of accurate measurements on Lake Victoria, water levels have ﬂuctuated widely since
1970 due to rainfall variability. This threatens the fisheries sub-sector on which the local population
relies for household food security and income generation.
Climate change is also a factor towards increased intensity of El Niño and La Nina events, resulting
in more severe and frequent ﬂoods and droughts. These events have become more intense since 1900
than at any time in the last 130,000 years. These droughts decimate livestock populations and crop
harvests, while excessive rainfall results in increased incidences of diseases such as Rift Valley Fever
(RVF). RVF outbreaks in the past have worsened food insecurity among pastoralists already suffering
from severe drought and ﬂoods (USAID, 2007).
These changing temperature and rainfall patterns have profound impacts on Kenya’s socio-economic
sectors, most of which are climate-sensitive. These sectors include Agriculture, Livestock, Water,
Health, Forestry, Energy and Fisheries. These impacts and others portend an increasingly worsening
and worrying situation in the future if national efforts are not enhanced to make agriculture climate
smart.
Past and current efforts by government have focused on policies and strategies to address climate
change challenges. The following are key policies and strategies the government has developed and is
implementing: Vision 2030, National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS), 2010; National
Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2013-2017; Agriculture Sector Development Strategy (ASDS)
2010-2020, the Agriculture (Farm Forestry Rules, 2009).
1.2.4 Climate Smart Agriculture
Globally, it is projected that food production will need to increase by a minimum of 50-70% by
2050 as the population is expected to increase from 7.4 billion in 2016 to 9.6 billion by 2050. At the
same time, it is forecasted that there will be a 5% decrease in global food production by 2050 and
that without adaptation, crop yields will decline by around 1.5% per decade (Lobell and Gourdji,
2012) or by approximately 5.6% by 2050 in an optimistic assessment. While increased agricultural
productivity is key to meeting global food production deficit, agriculture also contributes to emission
of greenhouse gases. It is currently estimated to contribute about 30% of the global greenhouse gas
emissions responsible for climate change and hence has critical role in emissions reduction.
The term “climate-smart agriculture” (CSA) was adopted in late 2010 at the 1st Global Conference on
Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change at the Hague to describe tensions between maximizing
global agricultural productivity, increasing the resilience of agricultural systems in the face of climate
change, and concerns to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. CSA was
defined as an agriculture that “sustainably increases productivity, enhances resilience, reduces/
removes greenhouse gas emissions, and enhances the achievement of national food security and
development goals” (FAO, 2010).  This definition set a global agenda for investments in agricultural
innovations that unite agriculture, development and climate change communities under a common
agenda through integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social and
environmental) by jointly addressing food security and climate challenges.

However existing national strategies and interventions have not adequately mainstreamed climate
change adaptation and mitigation in the agricultural sector. There is inconsistency between agriculture,
food security and climate change leading to inefficiencies in implementation of climate change
adaptation and mitigation interventions. In 2015, Kenya submitted its Intended Nationally Determined
Contribution (INDC) to the UNFCCC which has outlined CSA as a strategy to implement adaptation
and mitigation actions in the National Climate Change Action Plan (GoK, 2012). Therefore the sector
needs a sound and enabling Strategy that simultaneously addresses climate change adaptation and
mitigation, rural development, food security and environmental management.
1.5. METHODOLOGY
The development of the Climate Smart Agriculture Strategy was initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Livestock and Fisheries (MALF) and coordinated by the Climate Change Unit. Committee meetings
were held to prepare the strategy development roadmap with detailed terms of reference (ToR),
work plan, resource requirements and a concept note. The Principal Secretaries, State Department
for Agriculture, State Department for Livestock Production, State Department for Fisheries and the
Blue Economy, State Department for Environment and State Department for Irrigation constituted
a multidisciplinary team of experts to spearhead the development of the strategy. The task team
comprised experts with specialization in the following areas: Environment, Crops, Livestock,
Fisheries, Meteorology, Forestry, Irrigation, Policy Formulation and Climate Change.
The task team convened an induction workshop where key thematic areas, important resource
documents and key stakeholders were identified and draft strategy outline developed. The team
undertook literature review that informed the situational analysis and was used to determine the
strategic issues and strategy direction. The initial and subsequent CSA drafts were developed in
workshops and desktop working sessions. The process also engaged the Inter-Governmental Technical
Working Group (ITWG) on Policy, Legislation and Standards under the Secretariat of the Council
of Governors. The draft document was then subjected to further interrogation by senior technical
staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries and Ministry of Environment, Natural
Resources and Regional Development Authorities.  The draft was then subjected to wider stakeholder
consultations that brought together all the 47 counties in six clustered regional workshops in Garissa,
Mombasa, Meru, Naivasha, Kitale, and Kisumu.
The back to back workshops were held to capture input from stakeholders in the counties. The
views from regional/county consultations were collated and incorporated. The draft strategy was
then presented to Cabinet Secretary and Principal Secretaries for discussion and then presented to
a multi-stakeholder National Validation Workshop. The inputs from these two meetings were then
incorporated into a final strategy for climate smart agriculture and launched for implementation.
iv.	  Sustainable agriculture: This Strategy will endeavor to nurture healthy ecosystems and support
sustainable management of land, water and natural resources while ensuring increased productivity
for national food security. This will entail improving efficiency in the use of resources; direct
action to conserve, protect and enhance natural resources; and enhance resilience of people,
communities and ecosystems, especially to climate change and market volatility. This is in line
with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, as adopted on 25th September 2015.
v.
Good Governance: This Strategy will promote good governance that comprises Accountability
(sound fiscal choices, made in a transparent manner, that give priority to productive social
sectors such as agriculture); Transparency (decision-making, particularly in budget, regulatory
and procurement processes that is critical to the effectiveness of resource use and the reduction
of corruption and waste); The rule of law (a fair, predictable and stable legal framework to enable
actors assess economic opportunities and act on them without fear of arbitrary interference
and expropriation); and Participation (a consultation process that enables all stakeholders to
participate in the formulation of development strategies and in the design and implementation of
programmes and projects). This principle will guide the Strategy in institutionalizing an overall
enabling environment for implementation of CSA and mainstreaming climate change issues in
agriculture.
vi.	 Environmental Management:
a)	 The Polluter Pays Principle,
b)	 The User Pays Principle,
c)	 The Precautionary Principle,
d)	 The Principle of Effectiveness and Efficiency,
e)	 The Principle of Responsibility,
f)	 The Principle of total value,
g)	 The Principle of Participation, and
h)	 The Principle of Proportionality which is based on the concept of balance. To maintain
balance between economic development on the one hand and environmental protection
on the other. It cannot be disputed that no development is possible without some adverse
effects on ecology. Therefore, it is essential to adjust the interest of the people as well as
the necessity to maintain the environment. Moreover, comparative hardships have to be
balanced and benefits to a larger section of the people have to be maintained. This principle
will guide the Strategy in institutionalizing measures that will ensure balance between
increasing food supply and maintenance of environmental integrity.
1.4 JUSTIFICATON
Kenya’s agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events and climate variability
and change. Climate change has led to declining crop production due to variation in rainfall onset
dates, amounts, distribution and cessation. It has also caused loss of livelihood arising from loss of
livestock, particularly in ASAL areas due to depletion of natural vegetation and pasture. The recurrent
droughts and rising temperatures attributed to climate change continues to exert more pressure on
fisheries resources due to reduction of water supply, and increased evaporation of water in lakes and
rivers. The country therefore requires transformation of its agricultural systems to make them more
productive, resilient and competitive in generating incomes under a changing climate. CSA provides
an excellent opportunity for this transformation.  CSA is an approach that sustainably increases
agricultural production and incomes, builds resilience of agricultural systems to climate change and
minimizes GHG emissions.

CHAPTER TWO: SITUATION ANALYSIS
2.1 CURRENT SITUATION
2.1.1 Impact of Climate Change on the Agriculture Sector
Kenya’s total area is comprised of 97.8% land and 2.2% water surface. Out of this, only 16% of the
land falls within medium to high rainfall areas where 75% of the population live and the rest is arid
or semi-arid characterized by water deficit for sustainable agricultural production.
The high rainfall zones receive more than 1,000 mm per annum, occupy less than 20% of the
productive agricultural land and carry approximately 50% of the country’s population. Most of the
food and cash crops as well as livestock products are produced in these zones under semi-intensive
and intensive systems. The medium rainfall zones receive between 750 and 1000 mm of rainfall
annually and occupy between 30 and 35% of the 20% of the productive agricultural land area and
carry approximately 30% of the population. Farmers in these zones keep cattle and small stock, and
grow a wide range of crops. The ASALs receive 200 to 750 mm of rainfall annually and occupy about
84% of Kenya’s total land area. ASALs are predominantly used as rangelands and game parks and
carry 80% of the country’s livestock and 65% of the wildlife.
The impacts of climate change in Kenya’s agriculture sector are manifested in extreme weather
events that causes flooding, drought, landslides, strong winds; seasonal weather variations; increased
temperatures and gradual change in precipitation patterns. These impacts causes acute and chronic
threats to agro-based livelihoods and leads to encroachment into fragile ecosystems. Climate change
leads to land degradation and decrease in agricultural productivity; increased incidences of pests and
diseases affecting crops, livestock, fish and trees; as well as the destruction of physical and social
infrastructure. This leads to reduced yields and loss of income in the agriculture sector; food shortage
and malnutrition; reduced quality of produce and earnings as well as increased postharvest losses. In
addition, due to the high risks in agro-based enterprises, there is low agro-based investments and low
technology uptake for production and value addition. Though physical and social infrastructure is
needed to adapt to climate change, build resilience and exploit opportunities that arise due to climate
change, Kenya currently has inadequate and, in some cases inappropriate infrastructure such as for
irrigation.
Agricultural production relies heavily on finite resources that include land, water, forest and pastures.
People living in a specific area usually consist of different groups with divergent interests and therefore
compete for various natural resources leading to resource conflicts. Increased biodiversity loss due to
climate change disrupts ecosystem structure and functionality. Reduced biodiversity interferes with
provision of ecosystem services such as medicinal plants, aesthetics, food, and forest products which
eventually escalates conflicts. These conflicts may result in loss of human life, livestock and crops
hence disrupting agriculture, livestock and fisheries activities and affecting livelihoods and economic
development. Besides, agriculture expansion is in conflict with forest conservation as it has been
identified as a core driver of deforestation and forest degradation.
Crops sub-sector
The major climate change-related challenges in the crops sub-sector include changes in enterprise
suitability for specific areas, leading to decrease in profitability; unpredictable timing of farming
operations due to seasonal weather variability and reliability, leading to lower production efficiency;
losses due to yield reductions, total crop failures, enhanced postharvest losses and increased production
costs arising from extreme weather events or reduced land productivity.

availability, eutrophication, stratification, and toxicity of pollutants will lower the habitat quality and
availability of dissolved oxygen thereby lowering productivity and the nutritional value of aquatic
products.
Forestry sub-sector
Forests are also casualties to climate change. Kenya’s forest cover is estimated to be 7%, which
include both indigenous and plantation forests (FAO, 2015) and this is far below the internationally
accepted minimum level of 10%. Deforestation and forest degradation have caused significant
reduction in forest cover, destruction of habitat, loss of biodiversity, and increasing GHG emissions.
This is already evident in many places including upper parts of lower eastern conservancy such as
Machakos and Kitui, and Taita Taveta in coast conservancy as well as all ASALs of Kenya. Changing
climatic conditions have also affected the regeneration rate, and biodiversity composition, especially
of natural forests.
This decrease has resulted from unplanned excision of land for settlement and unsustainable
harvesting of trees without replanting. The destruction of forestland has contributed to increased rates
of flooding as the concentration time is reduced on bare ground leading to landslides and siltation
of rivers. Currently, efforts in forestry development in the country focuses on increasing forest/tree
cover through natural forest conservation, plantation forestry, dryland forestry, commercial forestry,
farm forestry, school greening programs and urban forestry to achieve the desired minimum 10%
tree cover. Government is also conserving and rehabilitating degraded water catchment areas. The
adoption of agro-forestry has improved over the years with government promoting farm forestry
and conservation of natural environment. Initiatives aimed at introducing commercial tree species in
ASALs to control desertification and improve livelihoods are on-going. Hence there is need for an
integrated landscape approach to conservation and restoration. The ASDS 2010-2020 (GoK, 2010b)
stipulates promotion of tree planting, wildlife conservation, agricultural productivity enhancement
and upscaling micro-enterprises which provide synergies that improve overall environmental and
production needs.
2.1.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Agriculture Sector
Kenya’s GHG emissions are expected to rise, consistent with a growing population and expanding
economy, with emissions increasing from 73 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in
2010 to 143 MtCO2e in 2030 (Figure 1). The livestock, agriculture and forestry sectors are the largest
emitters in Kenya accounting for approximately 67% of emissions in 2010. The largest absolute
growth in emissions is expected in energy and transport, with energy emissions increasing from 10
MtCO2e in 2010 to 33 MtCO2e in 2030 and transport emissions increasing by about three times in the
same period (NCCAP 2013-2017).
The UNFCCC has laid the foundation for the system of reporting on information on GHG emissions
by sources and removals by sinks, as well as on the actions that countries are taking to mitigate and
adapt to climate change e.g. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Biennial Update Reports
(BURs) and National Communication. This is key in determining the progress in the implementation
of agreements at both international and national levels. Hence the need for development of a
Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system.
Drought and floods lead to decline in crop production, total crop failure, degradation of the
environment and an increase in destitution. For instance, due to droughts, the country’s famine cycles
have reduced from 20 years (1964-1984), to 12 years (1984-1996), to two years (2004-2006) and to
yearly (2007/2008/2009). This necessitated distribution of approximately 530,000 metric tons (MT)
of assorted foodstuffs worth Ksh. 20 billion between 2004 and 2009 to feed a population of between
3.5 and 4.5 million people annually.
Livestock sub-sector
Climate change is having substantial effects on ecosystems and the natural resources upon which the
livestock sub-sector depends. Climate change has led to declining livestock production due to direct
and indirect impacts to both livestock and their production systems. In grazing systems, the direct
impacts include increased frequency of extreme weather events; increased frequency and magnitude
of droughts and floods; productivity losses due to physiological stress occasioned by temperature
increase; and change in water availability. The indirect impacts stem from agro-ecological changes
and ecosystem shifts that lead to alteration in fodder quality and quantity; change in host-pathogen
interaction resulting in increased incidences of emerging diseases; and disease epidemics. In non-
grazing systems, the direct impacts include change in water availability and increased frequency of
extreme weather events while the indirect impacts include increased resource prices (e.g. feed, water
and energy), disease epidemics and increased cost of animal housing (e.g. cooling systems).
Fisheries sub-sector
Fish are cold blooded organisms and depend on the environment in which they live in hence more
prone to climate change threats. The major climate change-related challenges in the fisheries sub-
sector emanate from changes in temperature regimes and precipitation patterns; extreme weather
events and water quality.
Climate change affects fisheries and aquaculture through acidification of the water bodies, changes in
sea temperatures and circulation patterns, the frequency and severity of extreme events, and sea-level
rise and associated ecological changes. These changes have the potential of altering the physico-
chemical properties of the fish habitats. Consequently, fish feeding, migration and breeding behavior
will be directly affected while indirectly the changes will affect growth, mortality and reproduction
(Brander, 2010). The distribution patterns of many fish species will probably change as warmer-
water species and colder-water species are both expected to move pole wards (Beare et al., 2004).
The changes manifest in the fish through increased metabolism that culminates in smaller body size
and a smaller brood, sex determination that favors the prevalence of females over males, expansion
and/or contraction of suitable habitats (e.g. coral reefs, sea grass beds and mangroves) and shifts in
the distribution of fish stocks due to alteration or reduction of feeding grounds, reduction in breeding
grounds, changes in migratory circuits that connect life stages, thereby affecting successful completion
of the life cycle and successful recruitment. Coastal areas with coral reefs are particularly vulnerable
to changes in temperature and acidity, with serious food security concerns for countries that rely on
these resources for food and coastal protection. This is because coral reefs provide both shelter and
feeding grounds for the juveniles of many fish species.
On the other hand, the flooding and sea-level rise may create new opportunities and environments
as polar ice melts (Easterling et al., 2007), resulting in new areas for mangroves and aquaculture
opportunities. In addition, new fisheries may become available as fish populations shift geographic
distributions. In aquaculture production systems, increased water temperatures, variability in water

Forestry sub-sector
According to the NCCAP 2013-2017, forestry and other land use related emissions accounted for 19.6
MtCO2e in 2010, or about 32% of national emissions. Deforestation, forest and grassland fires, land
clearing for agricultural production are the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. However,
farmers do not relate land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) to carbon emissions. Currently,
managing farmers’ high expectations from carbon market is critical as emphasis should be on benefits
that come from the farm in terms of increased productivity and incomes rather than the carbon trade.
2.1.3 Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework
There are various institutions and stakeholders that are core in climate change and climate smart
agriculture issues. In developing this strategy, policies, legislations and strategies related to climate
smart agriculture which are spread across different Government Ministries and State Agencies have
been reviewed and reference made to the Constitution of Kenya to ensure coherence, alignment and
identification of gaps.
2.1.3.1 Policies and strategies in relation to agriculture and climate change
a)	 Kenya Vision 2030
To achieve the objectives of Kenya Vision 2030, agriculture is expected to be innovative, commercially
oriented and modern. The Vision also states that the country aims to be a nation that has a clean, secure
and sustainable environment. It provides for an increase of 4% in forest cover and to lessen by half
all environment-related diseases. The Vision has provided for flagship projects in water catchment
management, land cover and land use mapping and specific programs in agricultural development,
and investment in renewable sources of energy. The implementation of Vision 2030 will lead to
the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) through programs envisaged in social,
economic and political pillars.
b)	 Agriculture Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) 2010-2020
The ASDS is the blue-print of the agricultural sector to implement Vision 2030. It sets out a detailed
plan to “position the agricultural sector as a key driver for delivering the 10% annual economic growth
rate envisaged under the economic pillar of Vision 2030”. It envisions “a food-secure and prosperous
nation” and aims to increase productivity; commercialization and competitiveness of agricultural
commodities and enterprises; and develop and manage key factors of production. The Strategy
advocates for sustainable land management and scaling up of appropriate technologies suitable for
drought-prone areas. It further proposes programs for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.
c)	 National Policy for the Sustainable Development of Northern Kenya and other Arid Lands
The Sessional Paper No. 8 of 2012 on National Policy for the Sustainable Development Northern
Kenya and other Arid Lands recognizes that pastoralists have successfully managed climate variability
for centuries. However, the policy notes that skills and indigenous knowledge will become more
valuable as the impact of global climate change becomes more pressing. The policy also states that
climate change will exacerbate the challenges already facing the arid and semi-arid regions of the
country. A key objective of this policy is to strengthen the climate resilience of communities living in
the ASALs and ensure sustainable livelihoods. The policy proposes a variety of measures to reduce
the effects of drought and climate change on vulnerable communities in the ASALs.
d)	 National Livestock Policy
The Sessional Paper No. 2 of 2008 (Revised 2015) on the National Livestock Policy identifies high
frequency and increased severity of droughts as one of the effects of the climate change phenomenon.
The policy identifies measures to enable the livestock sub-sector enhance its contribution to food
and nutritional security, provide raw materials for agro-based industries and contribute to improved
livelihoods in the country. It emphasizes the improvement of the livestock management systems for
sustainable development of the livestock industry. Due to frequent droughts that affect livelihoods
that are dependent on livestock, the policy proposes to establish a livestock insurance scheme that
will be operated in a public-private-partnership model.
Figure 1: Kenya’s GHG emissions between 1995 and 2010 and projections up to 2030
Crops sub-sector
The crops sub-sector contributes about 10% of all emissions from the agriculture sector and the
major greenhouse gases emitted are CO2, CH4 and N2O. These gases emanate from activities such as
deforestation, land use change, conventional tillage, flooding of paddy rice fields, and burning of crop
residues. Other sources include direct emissions from farm machinery due to inadequate maintenance
and unfavorable working conditions such as wet soils.
Livestock sub-sector
The livestock sub-sector contributes about 90% of the emissions from the agriculture sector mainly
from enteric fermentation. Livestock farming systems are largely extensive and clearing of forests
and grassland to open up land for grazing thereby emit greenhouse gases. The quality of ruminant
feeds available to farmers is of low quality and low digestibility. These, combined with poor animal
health and husbandry, contribute largely to high emissions. To sustain extensive production systems,
livestock farmers and pastoralists burn grassland to enhance growth of lush pastures. The pastoral
communities take pride in overstocking for social security without regard to pasture management
aspects, a practice that leads to overgrazing and land degradation. Other sources of emissions include
land preparation and fertilizer use during pasture establishment, processing of inputs, poor manure
management, processing of produce and transportation.
Fisheries sub-sector
The likely contributor of GHG emissions within the fisheries value chain is at fishing and fish farming
stages. In aquaculture production system, the construction of fish ponds, manufacturing of feeds and
fish feed waste contribute to the emissions. In capture fisheries, use of fossil fuel; inefficient and
poorly maintained engines; long fishing hours and shifting fishing grounds; transportation; and fish
storage and processing lead to GHG emissions.

k)	 Green Economy Strategy and Implementation Plan (GESIP)
The GESIP  underpins Kenya’s  commitment to undertake a transition to a green economy in line
with the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) held in
2012 (Rio+20 Summit). The GESIP outlines an avenue for functional interaction between economic
development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The plan proposes resilience building
efforts that focuses on ensuring that the economy and livelihoods are less vulnerable to risks and
challenges of climate change.
2.1.3.2 Institutional Framework
Various institutions address climate smart agriculture at different levels. These include National and
County Governments, Private Sector, Development Partners, Regional and Global Institutions as well
as other stakeholders. These different institutions and stakeholders undertake policy formulation,
regulatory functions, research and technology development, advisory and service provision,
implementation, capacity building and financing climate smart agriculture related activities.
Institutions involved in formulation of policies related to CSA include the following ministries,
departments and state agencies: Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENR); Ministry
of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (MALF); Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI); Ministry
of Lands and Physical Planning (MLPP); The National Treasury (TNT); Ministry of Devolution and
Planning (MDP); and Ministry of Energy and Petroleum (ME&P) and County Governments.
Regulatory institutions in matters related to climate smart agriculture include: National Environment
Management Authority (NEMA); Water Resources Authority (WRA); Water Services Regulatory
Authority (WaSReA); National Land Commission (NLC); National Biosafety Authority (NBA);
Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA); Directorate of Veterinary Services (DVS); Kenya Plant
Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS); Kenya Forest Service (KFS); and Fisheries Department in
charge of Monitoring, Control and Surveillance; and Fish Quality Assurance.
Research organizations that have a role in climate smart agriculture include: Kenya Agriculture
and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO); Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI);
Kenya Marine Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI); International Livestock Research Institute
(ILRI); World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF); Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR);
International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE); and Universities.
Institutions and stakeholders involved in advisory and provision of support services include:   Kenya
Meteorological Department (KMD); Department of Resource Surveys and Remote Sensing (DRSRS);
Kenya Forestry Service (KFS); National Irrigation Board (NIB); Regional Development Authorities
(RDAs); Regional Centre for Mapping Resources for Development (RCMRD); Inter-Governmental
Authority Centre on Pastoral Areas and Livestock Development (ICPALD) and NGOs.
Training institutions dealing with climate smart agriculture include the universities and middle level
colleges such as Kenya Water Institute, Bukura  Agricultural College, Kenya School of Agriculture,
Dairy Training Institute, Kenya Forestry College, Public and Private Agricultural Training Centres,
Kenya Institute of Organic Farming; Kenya Meat Training Institute and the Animal Husbandry and
Industry Training Institutes.
e)	 National Oceans and Fisheries Policy (2008)
The National Oceans and Fisheries Policy (2008) proposes ecosystem-based sustainable exploitation
of fishery resources conservation and management. For purposes of aquaculture, the policy proposes to
use adaptive and environmentally sustainable technologies and best international practices.  It further
requires the enforcement of fish handling standards that minimize post-harvest losses. With regard
to capture fisheries, it proposes sustainable management and responsible use of natural resources for
increased production and productivity.
f)	 Water Master Plan Towards 2030
The plan recognizes that the country has not fully developed her irrigation potential estimated at
1.342 million hectares. This is based on surface and underground water including water harvesting
and storage. It identifies that approximately 12% of the potential has been equipped with irrigation
infrastructure, presenting an opportunity to increase productivity to meet the rising demand for food
and other agro-products. However, it proposes formulation of irrigation development programmes
and financing to build infrastructure and a well-equipped human resource capacity for sustainable
operations and management. It also proposes the establishment of an institutional arrangement for
efficient management and coordination to facilitate enhanced participation of stakeholders so as to
embrace business-oriented irrigated agriculture.
g)	 National Land Policy (2007)
The policy focuses on sustainable and equitable use of land. It requires actions to address environmental
problems such as land degradation, soil erosion and pollution. The policy stipulates the principles of
conservation and management of land based natural resources; protection and management of fragile
and critical ecosystems including wetlands and arid lands. The policy further calls for extensive
overhaul to current policies and institutions in an attempt to address chronic land tenure insecurity
and equity. The overall objective of the policy is to secure rights over land and provide for sustainable
growth, investment and reduction of poverty in line with the Government’s overall development
objectives. This policy was developed through extensive stakeholder consultations and most policy
recommendations are reflected in the Constitution of Kenya, 2010.
h)	 National Climate Change Response Strategy (2010)
The strategy proposes adaptation and mitigation strategies to cushion climate sensitive sectors like
agriculture (GoK, 2010c). It focuses on ensuring that adaptation and mitigation measures are integrated
in all government planning and development objectives; has prioritized the most vulnerable sectors
of the economy for quick and immediate action; and has provided explicit measures for addressing
climate change in Kenya and defined criteria to track effectiveness of such measures. It has given
recommendations on priority interventions on climate smart agriculture.
i)	 National Climate Change Action Plan 2013-2017
The NCCAP identifies priority adaptation and mitigation actions for transforming to a low carbon
climate resilient development pathway. The priority adaptation actions for agriculture includes
coordination and mainstreaming of climate change into agricultural extension; establishment and
maintenance of climate change related information for agriculture; and upscaling specific adaptation
and mitigation actions. These actions include promotion and bulking of drought tolerant traditional
high value crops, water harvesting for crop production, index-based weather crop insurance,
conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and integrated soil fertility management.
j)	 Kenya National Adaptation Plan (NAP) 2015-2030
Its main objective is to consolidate the country’s vision on adaptation. This is supported by macro-
level adaptation actions that relate with the economic sectors and county-level vulnerabilities in order
to enhance long term resilience and adaptive capacity.

In agriculture, these activities include large scale agriculture, introduction of new pesticides, large scale
pest control programs, widespread introduction of new crops and animals, widespread introduction
of fertilizers, irrigated agriculture exceeding 50 hectares, major developments in biotechnology
including the introduction and testing of genetically modified organisms.
For processing and manufacturing industries, these include fertilizer manufacture or processing, large
scale tanning and dressing of hides and skins, large scale abattoirs (more than 15 animals per day)
and meat processing plants, large scale brewing and malting, bulk grain processing and storage, large
scale fish processing plants, pulp and paper mills and large scale food processing plants.
Agriculture (Farm Forestry) Rules 2009
The key elements of the farm forestry rules relevant to climate smart agriculture are its objectives and
purpose which is to maintain a compulsory farm tree cover of at least 10% of any agricultural land
holding. The 10% tree cover would enhance conservation of water, soil and biodiversity; protection
of riverbanks, shorelines, riparian and wetland areas; sustainable production of wood, charcoal and
non-wood products; provision of fruits and fodder; and carbon sequestration and other environmental
services.
Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA) Act No. 13 of 2013 (revised 2015)
This Act provides for consolidation of the laws on the regulations and promotion of agriculture
generally, to provide for the establishment of the Agriculture and Food Authority. It also makes
provision for the respective laws of National and County Governments in agriculture, excluding
livestock and fisheries and related matters in furtherance of the relevant provisions of the 4th schedule
of the Constitution and for connected purposes. The Act provides for formulation of policy guidelines
on development, preservation and utilization of agricultural land; noxious and invasive weeds; and
responsibilities of county governments.
Forest Conservation and Management Act No. 34 of 2016
The Act provides for establishment, development and sustainable management, including conservation
and rational utilization of forest resources for socio-economic development of the country. It has
provisions for enforcement of related regulations and creation and management of forests.
The Water Act No. 43 of 2016
The Act provides for the regulation, management, development and use of water resources, and water
and sewerage services. It has provisions for formulation of five-year integrated water services strategy
with plans, programs for protection, conservation, control and management of water resources;
establishment of water sector institutions which include Water Resources Authority (in place of Water
Resources Management Authority) to regulate water rights and works; the National Water Harvesting
and Storage Authority (in place of National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation); the
Water Services Regulatory Authority (in place of Water Services Regulatory Board); Water Works
Development Agencies (in place of Water Services Boards); the Water Sector Trust Fund (in place
of Water Services Trust Fund) to enhance water services; the Water Services Regulatory Authority to
control water service providers, and the Water Tribunal (in place of Water Appeals Board) for dispute
resolution. The act also addresses use of water resources to satisfy human and livestock needs, and to
protect ecosystems to secure ecologically sustainable development, including the responsibilities of
county governments and public private partnerships.
Land Act of 2012
This Act revises, consolidates and rationalizes land laws so as to provide for the sustainable
administration and management of land and land-based resources. It provides for the legal regime that
will govern, among others, the administration and management of public and private land, contracts
over land, leases, charges, easements and related rights. The Act applies to all public land, community
Organizations involved in financing of climate smart agriculture programmes and projects include:
The National and County Governments; United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); United
States Agency for International Development (USAID); Japanese International Cooperation Agency
(JICA); Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA); Danish International Development
Agency (DANIDA); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); African Development
Bank (AfDB); UK Department for International Development (DfID); German International
Development Agency (GIZ); German Government owned bank (KfW) and Australia Agency for
International Development (AusAID).
2.1.3.3 Legal Framework for CSA
Laws and regulations are integral to effective strategy implementation and operationalization. The
existing legal frameworks that govern issues which are directly and/or indirectly linked to climate
change and consequently to climate smart agriculture include the following:
The Constitution of Kenya 2010
The Constitution of Kenya 2010 provides for sustainable natural resource management in the bill
of rights especially land, environment and natural resources. Further, it requires “the state to ensure
sustainable exploitation, utilization, management and conservation of the environment and to ensure
equitable sharing of accruing benefits”. It states that land in Kenya shall be held, used and managed
in a manner that is equitable, efficient, productive and sustainable. The Constitution grants “every
person the right to a clean and healthy environment” which includes the right to have the environment
protected through legislative and other measures, thereby obliging the state to involve the public in
the management, protection and conservation of the environment. It also entitles “every person to
adequate, clean and safe water”.  The Constitution bestows upon every citizen the duty to cooperate
with state organs and other persons to protect and conserve the environment and to ensure ecologically
sustainable development and use of natural resources.
The Constitution, in its Fourth Schedule, stipulates the division and sharing of functions between
the National and County Governments. The National Government is mandated to carry out policy
formulation, disaster management, and protection of the environment and natural resources with a
view to establishing a durable and sustainable system of development and disaster management. The
functions of County Governments include implementation of specific National Government policies
on natural resources and environmental conservation which include CSA related functions such as
soil and water conservation; forestry and agroforestry; crop and animal husbandry; fisheries; disaster
management; water and sanitation services; and storm water management.
The Climate Change Act of 2016
This Act of parliament provides for a regulatory frame work for enhanced response to climate change
to provide for mechanisms and measures to achieve low carbon climate development and for connected
purposes. The Act is intended to be applied for the development, management, implementation and
regulation mechanisms to promote sustainable development.
Environmental Management and Coordination Act (EMCA), Cap 387
This Act provides a framework for environmental and social development and harmonizes the various
sector specific legislation impacting on environment and the management of natural resources. Under
the EMCA 1999 (revised 2013), there are a number of activities that are relevant to CSA which
require Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These include; changes in land use that entail
major changes in the use of land and large scale resettlement schemes. Also included are forestry
related activities such as clearance of forest areas, reforestation/afforestation with alien species, and
introduction of alien species and excisions of gazetted forest for whatever purposes.

2.1.4 Cross-Cutting Issues
(i)
Climate Smart Agriculture Finance
This is an important enabling aspect to support climate change mitigation and adaptation activities
in crops, livestock, fisheries, forestry and water sub-sectors.  The current sources of financing
climate change activities are from Government,  private and multilateral institutions such as World
Bank and African Development Bank; bilateral financial partners such as United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development (DfID), French Agency for Development (AFD), Danish
International Development Agency (DANIDA), German International Development Agency (GIZ),
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Swedish International Development Cooperation
Agency (SIDA), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO). However, there is no strategy that guides the financing of
climate change adaptation and mitigation activities by the different players in the agriculture sector.
(ii)
Equity and Inclusivity of Women Youth and Vulnerable Groups
The Bill of Rights in Chapter 4 of the Constitution of Kenya proscribes discrimination against all
persons directly or indirectly on any ground, including race, sex, pregnancy, marital status, health
status, ethnic or social origin, colour, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, dress,
language or birth. In the Agriculture Sector Development Strategy (2010-2020), social inclusion
and equity of Women, Youth and Vulnerable Groups (WY&VG) in the agriculture sector activities
is emphasized including safeguarding of their interests and rights for sustainable sector growth in
the light of climate change. Nevertheless, discrimination against WY&VG in the light of climate
change issues persists to date and would be largely responsible for low adaptive capacity and reduced
resilience of farming systems leading to problems of food and livelihood insecurity.
(iii)
Human Resource Development
Adequate human resource, both in terms of number and requisite skills, is required for effective
implementation of CSA. However, the numbers and skills available is not adequate to meet the needs
of CSA. This is due to many factors, including low employment of relevant professionals and limited
capacity of institutions to train on emerging issues such as adaptation and building resilience in
response to climate change impacts. The recent conversion of middle-level agricultural institutions
into institutions of higher learning has led to lack of adequate hands-on CSA technical agricultural
workforce.
(iv)
Research and Development
Although there are a number of national and international institutions engaged in CSA research, the
research activities are fragmented due to lack of coordination and some areas in the sector are not
catered for e.g. emerging crops and livestock. In addition, the research agenda on CSA is largely set
by development partners through provision of targeted funding and not demand driven. There is also
low public expenditure on research and limited participation by the private sector coupled with poor
management of agricultural research information.
(v)
Data and information on Climate Smart Agriculture
Strategic decision making and implementation of CSA initiatives require accurate, current, reliable
data and information. This includes collection, storage, access, collation, synthesis and dissemination
of climate smart agriculture data and information. Currently, there is no comprehensive climate smart
agriculture data and information management system. Creating an inventory for data is important
as main ingredient in provision and development of national communications. In addition, data
system and management is a tool for feeding to domestic frameworks for measurement, reporting and
verification (MRV), for the agricultural sector.
land and private land as defined in the Constitution of Kenya 2010. The Land Act outlines the
following guiding values and principles that are relevant to sustainable land management: sustainable
and productive management of land resources; conservation and protection of ecologically sensitive
areas; democracy, inclusiveness and participation of the people in land management. The Act binds
these values and principles on all state organs, state officers and all persons whenever any of them
enacts, applies or interprets any provisions of the Act or makes or implements public policy decisions.
Land Registration Act of 2012
This Act provides for revision, consolidation and rationalization of the registration of titles to land to
give effect to the principles and objects of devolved government in land registration. The Act provides
that no part of the land comprised in a land register shall be transferred unless the proprietor has first
sub-divided the land and duly registered each sub-division. It sets provisions that protect selling of
land. The Act however fails to give provisions for minimum and maximum land holding acreages in
respect of private land as required in Article 60 (1) of the Constitution which has implication on the
implementation of sustainable land management practices in farm holdings.
National Land Commission Act of 2012
The purpose of the Act is to make provision to the functions and powers of the National Land
Commission (NLC). The following objects and purposes of this act are relevant to CSA: management
and administration of land should be in accordance with the principles of land policy as set out
in the constitution and the national land policy; there should be linkage between the commission,
county governments and other institutions dealing with land and land related resources. In the Act,
the functions of the NLC relevant to CSA include: recommending a national land policy to the
national government; conducting research related to land and the use of natural resources, and make
recommendations to appropriate authorities; monitoring and oversight responsibilities over land use
planning throughout the country.
Other legislations
Other legislations that have bearing on climate change and climate smart agriculture include the
Acts establishing Regional Development Authorities which provide for resource mobilization for
investment in multipurpose water storage facilities; the Standards Act for regulating quality standards;
the Biosafety Act which establishes the National Biosafety Authority and  provides for the regulation
of genetically modified organisms; and the Energy Act which provides for the development and use
of renewable energy. There are also sanitary and phytosanitary legislations under DVS, Fisheries and
KEPHIS that have a bearing on CSA.
There is therefore need for collaboration to enable harmonization of implementation of the above
laws to harness synergy in addressing matters related to CSA.
2.1.3.4 Gaps in policies, legislations, strategies and institutional framework
Most of the existing policies, strategies and legislations are not aligned to the Constitution and do
not provide for coordination of CSA related issues, for a coherent and effective response to the
local, national and global challenges and opportunities on climate change as it affects   agriculture.
Further, the various CSA instruments provide limited innovative interventions on adaptation and
mitigation. There are inadequate mechanisms for linkages and coordination between CSA agencies
and stakeholders which results in overlaps and inefficiency in implementation of programs.

The SWOT analytical framework provides a scan of areas of strengths within the agriculture sector
and climate change which actors can take best advantage of and focus to consolidate gains, weaknesses
that require addressing as well as potential opportunities and threats posed within the operating
environment. In  order to determine the strategic issues that will inform the strategic focus for the CSA,
the SWOT analyses the impact of climate change on agriculture; greenhouse gas emissions; policy
legal and institutional framework; and the cross-cutting issues such as finance, equity and inclusivity,
natural resource management, human resource development and, research and development.

STRATEGIC ISSUES
The key strategic issues outlined below emanated from the analysis of the Strengths, Weaknesses,
Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) and the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and
Environmental (PESTLE) in the context of climate smart agriculture. This revolved around the
thematic areas of impact of climate change on the agriculture sector; green house gas emissions in the
sector; institutional, legal and regulatory framework for CSA; and the role of cross-cutting issues in
CSA. The strategic issues under each of the above areas are examined with respect to how they impact
on productivity, growth and development of the crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry subsectors.
2.4.1: Impacts of Climate Change on the Agriculture Sector
Strategic Issue 1: Vulnerabilities due to changes in temperature regimes and precipitation
patterns
Crops sub-sector
The changes in temperature regimes and precipitation patterns have led to the shifting of agro-
ecological zones thereby changing the geographical suitability of crop enterprises as well as shifting
the cropping seasons (such as planting dates and harvesting dates). This has resulted in reduced
production per unit area, increased post-harvest losses and production costs for crops. The changes
have also contributed to an increase in the incidences of pests and diseases in crops, as well as
emergence of new ones.
Crop simulation models show that, in general, temperature rise caused by climate change is the main
driver of crop yield decreases (Luedeling, 2011). All simulated crops respond negatively to higher
temperatures. Among crops that will find future climatic conditions intolerable are soy bean (with very
low yield potential and very high yield reduction under rising temperatures), cotton (its production
risk stems from its transitional place between two seasons), and to lesser extents maize and dry
beans. However, some crops are expected to experience more favorable growing conditions as a
result of climate change, such as banana, cassava, sorghum, sweet potato, pearl millet, groundnut, and
finger millet. There is also evidence that mango, banana, sugarcane and pineapple show increasing
suitability for all future climate scenarios (Luedeling, 2011). However, many suitability scenarios
enhanced by higher temperatures also seem constrained by water shortage.
Livestock sub-sector
Over time, heat stress increases livestock vulnerability to diseases, reduces fertility and milk production.
Temperature and precipitation contributes to increase in prevalence of parasites and diseases that
affect livestock. Diminished precipitation levels and enhanced temperatures have also led to decrease
in forage across most of Kenya. This was manifest in 2009 when livestock mortality rates reached
80% in southern Kenya due to drought and enhanced temperatures (Ericksen et al., 2012).
Fisheries sub-sector
Global warming has led to loss of cold-water fish farming areas. There is strong evidence partly
linking El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events with systematic changes in plankton abundance
and aquatic/marine plant as well as animal composition over recent decades in many regions
worldwide. The ENSO events with phases of warm water reduce plankton production, and cause fish
5.
LEGAL FACTORS
Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture
5.1	 Adequate legal instruments available at the local and international levels to address climate
change challenges e.g. the Constitution of Kenya, the Climate Change Act 2016, the Climate
Change Framework Policy and the Paris Agreement, 2015.
5.2	 Poor enforcement of laws and policies relating to CSA.
5.3	 Bill of Rights in the Kenya Constitution 2010 which supports inclusivity and equity and
Chapter 5 of the constitution that supports sustainable natural resource management.
GHG Emissions
5.4	 Lack of a consolidated legal framework in agricultural sector that guides mitigation efforts
on overlapping and linked mandates.
5.5	 Lack of clear land tenure rights, tree tenure/user rights and carbon rights jeopardize
implementation of mitigation actions.
5.6	 Lack of guidelines on carbon trading in the agriculture sector.
5.7	 Absence of structures and mechanism for monitoring emissions.
Policy Legal and Regulatory
5.8	 There is no legislation on age limit of imported farm machinery.
5.9	 Lack of legislation to regulate pollution from machinery and motor vehicles working in the
sector.
5.10	 Lack of legislations on land use/enterprise zoning.
Cross-cutting Issues
5.11	 Bill of Rights in the Kenya Constitution 2010 which supports inclusivity and equity and
Chapter 5 of the constitution that supports sustainable natural resource management.

6.
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture
6.1	 There is a shift in the seasonal rainfall patterns, distribution and reliability.
6.2	 There is a general rise in the average temperatures and changes in temperature ranges leading
to loss of agricultural land due to the rise of sea level.
6.3	 Shift in agro-ecological zones for agriculture production due to changes in temperature and
rainfall regimes.
6.4	 There is abundant and unexploited solar and wind energy.
6.5	 There is increased encroachment of water catchments leading to land degradation.
6.6	 Un-sustainable use of natural resources.
GHG Emissions
6.7	 Rapid land use change and desertification.
6.8	 Overfishing, overstocking, deforestation and wetland degradation.
6.9	 Inappropriate agricultural waste management.

Drought, floods and strong winds also lead to the destruction of infrastructure such as the silting of
dams, clogging and breaking of irrigation and drainage infrastructure; destruction of farm buildings
and roads; drying, storage and marketing facilities, as well as agro-based industries. Wet conditions
during harvest of cereals lead to enhanced postharvest losses due to rotting and aflatoxin contamination.
Strong winds, landslides and dust storms also contribute to the reduction of soil fertility through
erosion and translocation of the fertile top soils.
Livestock
Extreme weather events, especially droughts and floods lead to reduced pasture and forage
availability, degradation of the environment and an increase in destitution. Strong winds and dust
storms also contribute to the reduction of forage availability as they erode top soil, thus making grass
regeneration difficult even when it rains. Recurring droughts have caused heavy losses to livestock,
forcing an estimated 30% of livestock owners out of pastoralism in the past 20 years. Estimated
livestock mortality as a result of drought is about 10–15% above normal in the affected areas, which
is equivalent to 5% of Kenya’s livestock population (World Bank, 2011). Between 2008 and 2011,
drought caused losses in livestock that amounted to about KSh. 700 billion. Extended periods of
drought erode livelihood opportunities and community resilience and leads to undesirable coping
strategies that damage the environment and impair household nutritional status, further undermining
long-term food security.
Fisheries
Extreme weather events such as heavy tropical storms and drought incidences that are projected with
the changing climate will affect fisheries and aquaculture through acidification of the water bodies,
changes in sea temperatures, circulation patterns and associated ecological changes. These changes
have the potential of altering the physico-chemical properties of the fish habitats. Consequently, fish
feeding, migration and breeding behavior will be directly affected while indirectly the changes will
affect growth, mortality and reproduction (Brander, 2010). The distribution patterns of many fish
species will probably change as warm-water species and cold-water species are both expected to
move pole wards (Beare et al., 2004). The changes manifest in the fish through increased metabolism
that culminates in smaller body size and a smaller brood, sex determination that favors the prevalence
of females over males, expansion and/or contraction of suitable habitats (e.g. coral reefs, sea grass
beds, and mangroves).
The changes also leads to shifts in the distribution of fish stocks due to alteration or reduction of
feeding grounds, reduction in breeding grounds, and changes in migratory circuits that connect
life stages, thereby affecting successful completion of the life cycle and successful recruitment, a
factor that will translate into reduced earnings for the fisher folk. Coastal areas with coral reefs are
particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature and acidity, with serious food security concerns
for countries that rely on these resources for food and coastal protection. This is because coral reefs
provide both shelter and feeding grounds for the juveniles of many fish species. According to the
IPPC estimates, the sea level will rise by between 17 and 59 cm by the end of this century, which is
well below estimates by other scientists who predict a rise of up to 1 m even if GHG emissions were
kept at a low level.
Forestry
The projected rise in temperatures and long periods of drought will lead to more frequent and intense
forest fires. These have in the recent past affected Kenya’s major forests including the Mau and Mt.
Kenya Forests. Kenya has over the past 20 years lost more than 5,700 hectares of forest cover per
year due to forest fires causing phenomenal economic damage that is yet to be quantified. The rise in
temperature could extend the ecosystems range of pests and pathogens. This is likely to affect many
stocks to decline. In addition, changes in ocean circulation are predicted to lead to loss of certain fish
populations or establishment of new ones. Temperature changes will likely result in changes of up-
welling patterns, which might affect fish spawning period and success of larvae, thereby altering the
entire life cycle and size of fish populations.
Forestry sub-sector
The distribution of most of Kenya’s forests is determined by rainfall. With rainfall as one of the most
affected climatic elements, the survival of Kenya’s forest resources is likely to be severely affected.
For example, the ASALs are subject to recurring droughts, which when coupled with overexploitation
of resources, result in high vulnerability to land degradation and desertification. This not only
increases levels of GHG emissions, but simultaneously threatens livelihoods. The vulnerability of
Kenya’s forest resource is further exacerbated by the depletion of forest and other land cover through
rapid increase in population and demand for human settlements; both agricultural and grazing land;
construction materials; food; fuel wood; essential oils; and herbal medicines.
Climate change adds to the stresses on Kenya’s forest cover by altering the growth of trees, causing
dieback in forests and animal species to migrate, which will in turn impact on forest products supply.
The reduction in forest cover will have disastrous effects on downstream agriculture and hydropower
generation, with big rivers such as Ewaso-Nyiro being reduced to small streams and hundreds of
other small rivers completely dry up especially during serious drought periods. This has serious
implications for the livelihoods of those living downstream and the rest of the country, which depend
on products from these ecosystems.
Changes in temperature usually leads to changes in vegetation while some species may become
extinct. For example, some tree species such as Melia volkensii, Terminalia spinosa, Delonix elata,
and Hyphaene coriacea in the North Eastern region, and Psychotria species in the Taita Hills of coast
region may either dwindle in abundance or become extinct.
Strategic Issue 2: Vulnerabilities due to extreme weather events
Crops
Climate change has led to more frequent and intense extreme weather events such as drought, floods,
strong winds, hailstorms, and frosts. Droughts lead to loss of investments in crop production due to
reduced yields or total crop failure as a result of water stress, inhibiting plant nutrient abstraction from
the soil and the vital physiological processes of the plant. Floods lead to anaerobic soil conditions,
hindering the ability of the roots to aerobically respire and abstract nutrients from the soil. This
results in plant stresses that reduces yields or causes total crop failure. Strong winds lead to breakage,
logging or physical injury of the crop, accelerated evapotranspiration that lead to crop stress and
yield reduction. Hailstorms cause physical crop damage, reducing the photosynthetic leaf area and
predisposing the plant to disease infections. In some cases, depending on the degree and stage of the
crop, hailstorm damage may trigger rapid translocation of photosynthates from the vegetative parts
of the plant to the reproductive (yield determining) parts. This may in turn enhance the achievement
of better yields.
Frosts are more prevalent in the upper highlands, affecting mainly tea and horticultural crops, thereby
reducing the yields and quality of the produce. Frosts lead to crystallization of water within plant
tissues, causing death of the resultant tissues, and if widespread, death of the plants may occur.
Depending on the magnitude and spread, this affects both the quantity and quality of the produce.

Ecosystems in which cultivation, forest management or grazing are dominant activities are at present
often negatively affected by human-induced causes, most importantly by land use and land use changes
that affect the biophysical characteristics of the land (e.g. pollution, salinization, nutrient depletion).
Where management practices are poorly adapted to local ecological conditions, degradation can
occur. Even a number of causes that are seemingly natural can have wholly or partly indirect human
causes (bush invasion, forest fires, floods, landslides and droughts).
About 14% of the 1.3 million hectares of Kenya’s irrigation potential has been exploited. High variability
in rainfall complicates irrigation scheduling because most systems abstract water directly from river
flows. Less than 10% of irrigator’s abstract water from dams and 5% from ground water, domestic
water supply systems and waste water. Water storage potential has been under-developed and there
are major challenges in achieving equitable water allocation and deliveries. As much as 30 to 60% of
abstracted irrigation water is lost to seepage, evaporation, tail water loss and weed transpiration due
inefficient irrigation systems and application technologies. Water saving technologies such as lining
of canals, sprinklers, drip kits and low cost greenhouses have not yet been widely adopted by farmers.
Land use planning is important in improving the sustainable use and management of natural resources.
Planning for sustainable land management require integrated information and knowledge as well
as  empowerment of all stakeholders involved in participatory approaches to land use planning. At
the moment the capacities of the stakeholders are limited hence few mechanisms are in place for
effective land use planning for sustainable utilization of natural resources. There is therefore need for
integrated information and knowledge on the extent of these natural resources and their distribution
across the country.
Degradation of natural resources is a serious threat to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of
resources. This threatens both the economic and physical well-being of the communities dependent on
natural resources. Climate change exercabates human activities such as deforestation and degradation
and disrupts ecosystem structure and functionality. There is therefore need to promote sustainable use
and management of natural resources.
Livestock
In this sub-sector, soil health and water quality affect growth of pasture and fodder through diminished
capacity of soils to avail water and nutrients to the plants; increased risk of soil erosion by water and
wind; and increased soil surface temperatures and greater rates of mineralization of soil organic
matter. Other challenges emanate from colonization of grazing systems by invasive species such as
Prosopis juliflora (Mathenge).
According to NEMA’s State of Environment Report of 2006/07, major floods periodically afflict
the Lake Victoria basin, Lower Tana basin and the Coastal region, occurring at least six times in
the past 50 years. In these areas, higher turbidity, siltation, and sedimentation occur. Floods carry
fertilizer and pesticide residues into water bodies resulting in eutrophication, which has detrimental
impacts on water quality and livestock production. According to the NEMA report, serious droughts
have occurred at least 12 times in the past 50 years. Major rivers including the Tana, Athi, Sondu
Miriu, Ewaso-Nyiro and Mara have experienced severe reduced volumes during droughts and many
seasonal ones have completely dried up. The parts of the country most affected are Eastern, North
Eastern and parts of Rift Valley regions.
aspects of forests such as tree-growth, survival, yield and quality of wood and non-wood products.
The impact of pests may result in the curtailment of plantation programmes, abandonment of certain
tree species, or the necessity to harvest large areas dominated by infested trees as witnessed in the late
1990s when the country had to clear huge tracts of cypress plantations because of cypress aphid attack.
There are already fears of a widespread attack on Pinus patula (Mexican weeping pine) plantations
in South Africa and these could easily spread northwards to Kenya.
Strategic Issue 3: Vulnerabilities due to unsustainable use of natural resources
Kenya’s economy is highly dependent on the natural resource base as it is critical for survival. Majority
of Kenyans depends on agriculture, livestock, fishing and forestry as their main source of livelihood.
All the four sub-sectors rely greatly on the natural resources to thrive.
Crops
Unsustainable land and agricultural water management affect both land and water through accelerated
erosion, soil mining, salinization, seawater intrusion and groundwater depletion. These impacts have
been exacerbated by climate change and have led to decline in soil health and water quality by
altering the chemical, physical and biological properties through erosion, leaching, sedimentation
and accelerated breakdown of organic matter. This eventually determines crop nutrient and water use
efficiency, affecting the costs of production and hence productivity.
Soil chemical properties such as pH, organic matter content, cation exchange capacity and cation
ratios determine soil fertility. Various crops respond differently to soil pH ranges, nutrient levels and
ratios, impacting on their growth and performance. The physical properties of soil determine the
workability for mechanization, soil erodibility, and water holding properties, water infiltration, plant
root penetration and water abstraction. Soil biological properties determine the diversity of the soil
fauna, microfauna, flora and microflora which could be beneficial or detrimental to crop production
and productivity.
Due to pressure from agriculture, both soil and water resources are being degraded through erosion,
salinization, seawater intrusion; and groundwater depletion. In addition, the current model of intensive
agriculture is associated with a high carbon and greenhouse gas footprint, while at the same time
many agricultural systems are highly vulnerable to the predicted impacts of climate change.
Nachtergaele et al. (2010) broadened the definition of land degradation beyond simply soil erosion
or loss of soil fertility, extending it to the deterioration of a balanced ecosystem and the loss of the
services that ecosystem provides. Land degradation thus needs to be considered in an integrated way,
taking into account all ecosystem goods and services; biophysical as well as socio-economic.
The current 1600 million hectares of cultivated land represent the better and more productive part of
global land resources. However, parts of this land are degrading through farming practices that result
in water and wind erosion, nutrient mining, topsoil compaction, salinization and soil pollution. As a
result, the productivity of the land resource base has declined. Land degradation also leads to off-site
problems, such as sedimentation of reservoirs, reduced watershed system functioning and carbon
dioxide emissions.

Fisheries
In capture fisheries, a number of activities contribute to GHG emissions either directly or in-directly.
These include the use of fossil fuel and inefficient engines; long fishing hours, transportation, and
storage and processing of fish. In addition, upstream land degradation leads to siltation of water bodies
and displacement of fish habitat. Fishing on depleted fish stocks requires more fuel per kilogram of
landed fish than fishing on abundant fish stocks, because low fish abundance forces fishers to search
longer and use of heavier gear to catch the fish.
Further, in aquaculture, the establishment of fish ponds leads to land degradation. This is due to
land clearing, excavation/soil disturbance and inadequate restoration. The exposure of the soils and
reduction of vegetation cover further contributes to carbon emissions.
Forestry
Clearing of trees to open up land for agricultural activities leads to land degradation if sustainable
measures are not put in place. Trees are carbon sinks and their elimination leads to reduction of
greenhouse gas absorption from the atmosphere. Promotion of agroforestry in croplands have huge
potential for forest carbon stock enhancement because of the high additionality. However, there
is lack of effective incentive mechanisms to motivate reductions of emissions from deforestation
and forest degradation, forest conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of
carbon stocks (REDD+) in the farming systems.
Strategic Issue 6: Lack of accountable quantification of GHGs emissions
The agriculture sector lacks adequate mechanisms for measuring, reporting and verifying its
greenhouse gas emissions. This is critical for tracking the progress in achieving its commitment to
international agreements and obligations.
2.4.3 Policy Legal and Institutional Framework
Strategic Issue 7: Weak policies, legislations, enforcement, and overlap of mandates among
institutions involved in regulation
There exists several policies and legislations that guide CSA related issues. However they have the
following challenges; inadequate content on climate smart agriculture; poor enforcement of CSA
related laws and; overlap of mandates among institutions implementing CSA issues.
Strategic Issue 8:  Poor coordination and collaboration among institutions and stakeholders in
climate smart agriculture
There is a large number of diverse institutions with CSA related functions. These functions include
policy setting, regulatory, research, advisory and provision of support services, capacity building and
financing. The challenges faced by the various institutions while implementing and coordinating CSA
activities are inadequate coordination among stakeholders; uncoordinated planning, implementation,
monitoring and evaluation of programmes and projects; lack of harmonization between National and
Development Partners’ priorities; and inadequate linkages between National and County Governments
in CSA related issues. There is therefore need to establish coordination and collaboration mechanisms.
This will ensure effective implementation of programmes for improved agricultural production and
productivity; build resilience; and mitigate GHG emissions.
2.4.4 Cross-cutting Issues
Strategic Issue 9: Inadequate financing of CSA activities
Climate change financing to the agriculture sector from the exchequer has not been forthcoming
in the amounts needed in the past and financing gaps are projected in the future. This has been due
to other pressing government priorities. In addition, the financing from the private sector has been
Fisheries
Kenya’s aquatic ecosystem and species are prone to diverse anthropogenic threats. Pollution,
uncontrolled water abstraction, deforestation, siltation, and unregulated physical developments have
serious and significant impacts on the breeding areas of coastal and inland waters. The proliferation
of alien aquatic flora and fauna invasive species (e.g. water hyacinth) threatens sustainability of the
indigenous species.
Forestry
Forests and related forestry activities contribute to improved agricultural productivity through
conserving soil and water, and enhancing soil fertility. The destruction of forestland, coupled with
climate change, has contributed to increased rates of flooding as the concentration time is reduced
on bare ground leading to landslides and siltation of rivers. In the low lying coastal areas where
mangroves occur, a small increase in sea level will leave mangroves submerged unless they can retreat
further inland, which is improbable due to human encroachment. Research undertaken by the Kenya
Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) as well as other organizations and individuals
indicates evidence of mangrove loss due to climate change and other factors in several areas along
the Kenyan coast such as Gazi Bay, Mwache Creek, Ngomeni, Tana River Delta and Dodori Creek.
2.4.2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Agriculture Sector
Strategic Issue 4: Emissions from key sources in agricultural production systems
Crops sub-sector
The main source of emissions is from the paddy rice production system. Emissions from paddy
rice depend on rice varieties, water management, soil organic matter management, temperature,
soil properties, as well as rice straw management. The poor management of rice straw in flooded
paddy rice production systems contribute to methane emissions. Application of rice straw to paddy
fields significantly increases the methane emission rate compared to application of the rice straw
compost or chemical fertilizer. The burning of rice residues such as straw and husks also contributes
to greenhouse gas emission. However, the plants themselves are a major source of methanogenic
feedstock compared to external inputs including the rice straw. Emissions from paddy rice production
can be addressed by adoption of best practices/technologies and innovations.
Livestock sub-sector
The emissions are mainly from enteric fermentation due to low-quality and low-digestibility of ruminant
feeds. Poor animal health and husbandry and limited intensification of livestock management systems
that lead to low productivity also contributes to emissions. Another key source of emissions arises
from manure management. Aspects of manure management relate to housing, manure collection,
storage system and utilization. There is very low adoption of recommended measures to address the
management of emissions arising from manure in livestock production systems.
Strategic Issue 5: Emissions from other sources in agricultural production systems
Crops
Poor agricultural practices such as inappropriate tillage, burning of agricultural residues, clearing
of trees in farmlands and inappropriate use of fertilizers contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. In
addition, emissions arise from agricultural machinery, post-harvest practices, and agro-processing
and residue management.
Livestock
Land degradation is a key issue in pastoral and agro-pastoral areas where communities keep livestock
as the main source of livelihood. Overstocking is a common practice which in effect leads to
overgrazing. The practice of overgrazing and burning of pasture in rangelands lead to both reduced
carbon sinks and enhanced emissions in rangelands.

emerging crops, trees, livestock and fish issues are being neglected. Lack of coordination also leads
to duplication of efforts and limited synergy in research efforts. Though a number of institutions are
engaged in CSA research, there is no framework that facilitates inter-institutional knowledge storage,
integration, packaging and dissemination. Most of the CSA information generated is in formats that
most end users are not able to isolate and apply in their specific regions for better production.
In local communities, there exists innovative traditional and cultural practices that ensure adaptive and
resilient farming systems. However, research on mitigation and adaptation has not adequately taken
into account the indigenous technical knowledge that would contribute towards better adaptation and
mitigation towards climate change in the agriculture sector.
There is need to enhance capacity of institutions to undertake mitigation and adaptation research
which entails availing adequate infrastructure for research; providing adequate skilled research
personnel, adopting indigenous knowledge and culture, enhancing capacity to carry out MRV, and
increasing operational resources for CSA research. Additionally, there is need to improve coordination
of research, innovation, knowledge generation and dissemination.
Strategic Issue 13: Inadequate data and information on CSA
In the agricultural sector, there is inadequate CSA related data and information for estimating GHG
emissions and monitoring activities on climate change adaptation and mitigation. Further, the existing
CSA data and information is scattered across various actors hence is incompatible and difficult to
integrate. Besides, there is no climate smart agriculture resource centre or a platform to share data and
information on climate smart agriculture.
There is therefore need to establish and maintain a data and information management system,
build capacities on data collection and information management, and promote data generation and
dissemination during planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation at both national and
county levels. This will help in developing reliable country inventory system on GHG emission as
well as enhance MRV.
inadequate due to lack of structured partnership arrangements. Other development partners have
provided finance for CSA activities through NGOs, CSOs and programmes and projects but this has
been poorly coordinated, leading to duplication of efforts.
There are several sources of international climate finance such as Green Climate Fund (GCF),
Adaptation Fund, and Global Environmental Fund, but the process of accessing these sources to
support climate smart agriculture is complicated.
The Climate Change Act, 2016 provides for the establishment of a Climate Change Fund. This avails
an opportunity to enhance financing for CSA activities from both domestic and international sources.
Strategic Issue 10: Limited capacity of Women, Youth and Vulnerable Groups (WY&VG) to
participate in CSA activities
These groups have limited education and limited access to land and other natural resources. In addition,
women spend most of their time addressing domestic responsibilities and livelihood challenges
leaving less time to attend to capacity building initiatives for acquisition of extra skills on climate
smart agriculture. Both women and youth lack awareness and capacity to undertake CSA activities
that are attractive to them.
In the face of climate change, the ability of WY&VG to obtain productive resources is reduced.
Climate variability and change has serious implication on food security: food availability, accessibility,
utilization and systems stability. In the context of climate change, food sources become more erratic
and scarce, making WY&VG to experience food insecurity and loss of income. The related increases
in food prices make food more inaccessible to WY&VG resulting to deterioration in their nutrition
and health status. Besides, in the rural areas, WY&VG are highly dependent on climate-sensitive
biomass such as wood, agricultural crops, wastes and forest resources for their energy and livelihoods.
Strategic issue 11: Limited human resource capacity to undertake CSA
Climate smart agriculture is an emerging issue in agriculture that has received limited attention.
There is limited capacity in personnel with specialized training to handle such emerging issues
as adaptation and mitigation of climate change. Consequently, there is inadequate CSA services
provided by extension service providers. In addition, CSA has received very limited attention in
training institutions. There has been some effort towards mainstreaming CSA in formal training
institutions at certificate, diploma, graduate and postgraduate levels but it has not been possible to
enforce quality standards in the training. Furthermore, some private institutions offer CSA training
but are not accredited due to lack of a clear accreditation scheme.
Thus climate change impacts in agriculture is a serious challenge requiring active participation of all
members of the society to manage. However, there is no effective social mobilization frame work
under functional communication structure that can help to rally all segments of the society to take
appropriate action towards mitigation and adaptation.
Strategic Issue 12: Limited CSA research technology development and innovations
There is limited research on CSA due to inadequacy of operational resources, infrastructure and skilled
research personnel for the development of demand driven CSA technologies and innovations. Rare and

sector
Strategic Objectives: Enhanced capacity to measure, report and verify emissions from the agriculture
sector
Strategies
(i)
Development of Measurement, Reporting and Verification Systems
The MRV systems help in improving the transparency in reporting of actions and mitigation
measures in the agriculture sector. This will involve setting standards and install MRV
infrastructure and development of an inventory system data bank on sector emissions.
Development of structures on data collection and recording including an inventory will be
necessary for continuous reporting on GHG emissions status for the country, particularly on
the interventions carried out on mitigation.

specialists from the Joint Agricultural Secretariat (JAS) will form the secretariat of the SWAGs. Other
experts from the sector are proposed to be part of the SWAGs depending on the subject matter under
consideration. The SWAGs will be expected to meet at least once quarterly or according to need and
will be co-chaired by the two levels of government.
The Steering Committee will be authorized to disband existing or establish more Sectoral Working
Groups according to identified needs. Consequently, the proposed entry point for CSA will be through
the establishment of a SWAG whose composition will be determined by the sector demands and
needs. The SWAG for CSA will be expected to facilitate coordination, harmonization and liaison
between national and county governments through:
a)	 Monitoring and evaluating the implementation of CSA initiatives
b)	 Compiling annual intergovernmental sub-sector CSA reports,
c)	 Facilitating capacity building of national and county bodies on CSA related issues
d)	 Preparing and follow-up upon events and functions between the national and county
governments, including meetings of the Inter-Governmental Forum (IGF) for agriculture,
Inter-Governmental Steering Committee (IGSC) and ad hoc multi-stakeholder consultation
bodies on CSA related  issues
e)	 Establishing a forum for joint planning on CSA programmes
4.2.1	 The County Governments
The County Governments will be responsible for implementation of this strategy. Each county will
thus develop CSA policies, strategies and plans to guide implementation or integrate County specific
strategies into their County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs)  and other plans.
4.2.2	 Ministry responsible for energy
The ministry responsible for energy at the two levels of government should explore and promote
affordable and reliable clean energy for use in agriculture during energy generation.
This is because the production, storage and value addition of crops; livestock; fisheries; and forestry
require energy supply. Current energy sources include hydroelectric, geothermal and wind power;
petroleum products; solar; wood fuel and biogas. They are used in land preparation, processing and
transportation of crops; livestock; fisheries; and forestry commodities. Some of these energy sources
particularly wood fuel and petroleum products contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
4.2.3	 Ministry responsible for transport and infrastructure
The national and county governments need to prioritize rehabilitation and maintenance of trunk and
rural access roads, respectively. Product marketing and trade require developed and well maintained
infrastructure networks. There is need for legislation and enforcement on minimum emissions from
vehicles, plant and machinery. This will ensure reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
4.2.4	 Ministry responsible for industrialization and enterprise development
The national and county governments through the ministries responsible for industrialization and
enterprise development will need to develop and support implementation of policies and strategies
that will encourage investment in processing and value addition of agricultural produce. To enhance
productivity and income, producers need to be organized into viable groups that can sustainably
satisfy the needs of various commodity industries and consumers.
4.2.5	 Ministry responsible for land
Activities on land heavily impact water sources and the agricultural environment. In Kenya, land
is classified as private, communal or public. All categories of classification support agricultural
CHAPTER FOUR: STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
4.1
INTRODUCTION
The realization of the objectives of this CSA strategy will depend on the roles and responsibilities
undertaken by the ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) responsible for; agriculture
environment, energy, transport and infrastructure, finance, industrialization and enterprise development,
land, water and irrigation, regulatory and support institutions at both levels of governments. The
MDAs will also need to be coordinated to avoid overlaps and to create synergy in pursuit of effective
strategy implementation. Further, the devolution of agricultural functions will necessitate regular
consultation and coordination between national and county governments.
4.2
COORDINATION OF THE STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION
The National Government through the Agriculture Sector MDAs will be responsible for policies,
strategies and regulatory services including CSA. The County Agriculture Sector MDAs will spearhead
the implementation of the identified strategies in the counties. The coordination framework and
implementation mechanism for KCSAS will be harmonized with the inter-governmental coordination
structure for the agriculture sector that is currently under development and is expected to be finalized
soon. The proposed agriculture sector coordination structure (Figure 2) proposes the establishment of
Sector Working Agriculture Groups (SWAGs).

To implement the KCSAS, the bulk of the funding will be provided to the relevant Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (MDAs) by the national and county governments through the Exchequer.
This will be guided by the national and county prioritized CSA programs and projects including
sectoral policies and strategies. In addition, efforts will be made to mobilize technical and financial
support from development partners and civil society to realize the objectives of this strategy. A CSA
fund basket shall be established and proper mechanisms set up for oversight and governance. Both
levels of government will explore possibilities of benefiting from the climate change fund provided
for in climate change Act 2016 for inclusion of budgetary provisions for CSA at both national and
county levels. Further, the government at both levels will explore possibilities and accessing existing
climate–related dedicated funding for use in CSA activities/joint sourcing of funding from potential
donors by National/County Committees.
Direct financing and investments by the private sector through public private partnerships (PPPs)
is critical to the successful implementation of this strategy initiative. To this end, the national and
county governments will create conducive environments to facilitate participation of the private
sector. This will include strengthening financial institutions, providing loan facilities to support
farmers’ investments, savings and risk management for CSA activities; ensuring availability of credit
to farmers at concessionary interest rates and appropriate insurance schemes to protect farmers from
impacts associated with climate change.
4.4
IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is a tool for assessing the success of result based management. It
provides decision makers, sponsors and other stakeholders with better means of learning from past
experience, improving service delivery, planning, allocating of resources and demonstrating results
as part of accountability to key stakeholders.
For successful implementation of this strategy, an M&E framework will be developed as an
integral component to ensure the strategy objectives are achieved in a cost effective, coordinated
and harmonized approach at both the national and county levels. The ministry responsible for
crops, livestock and fisheries in collaboration with the county governments, relevant implementing
Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), private sector and other stakeholders will develop an
M&E framework within six months of the strategy launch. For purposes of this strategy, the ministry
shall also undertake a comprehensive baseline survey that will be used to gauge achievement of CSA
related agricultural activities.
The M&E framework is expected to be consistent with the National Integrated Monitoring
and Evaluation Systems (NIMES) and have clear terms of reference for relevant stakeholders
in data collection and reporting at all levels. There will be an Annual Review Report (ARR) on
implementation of the strategy that will be presented to the Climate Change Council (CCC) by the
Cabinet Secretary responsible for Crops, Livestock and Fisheries for dissemination to the public and
relevant stakeholders. The strategy will be reviewed periodically to address the sector challenges and
emerging issues.
production and are threatened by different aspects of citizen behavior that require the interventions
of both levels of governments by implementing  land consolidation, setting minimum land size
for agricultural use and protection of government land. Land should be set aside for research in
agriculture, water towers and gazetted forests.
4.2.6	 Ministry responsible for environment and natural resources
This ministry will be responsible for policies and strategies for conservation of forests, water
catchments, water towers, wetlands, riparian areas and rehabilitation of degraded areas.  These areas
provide important habitats for fish and other biodiversity while maintaining ecosystem goods like
water resource. The ministry also formulates programmes for promotion of dryland forestry to create
resilience in the ASALs. The forest and water catchments need to be protected by reforestation and
afforestation activities in gazetted forests, farmlands and communal lands. The overall goal is to have
a 10% forest cover in the country.
Wetland and forest sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere regulates climate and optimizes crops,
livestock and fisheries production. These are strategic for improvement of agricultural production,
reduction of poverty and environmental degradation.
4.2.7	 Ministry responsible for water and irrigation
The ministry is responsible for formulation of policies, strategies and programmes for sustainable
development and management of water resources. Water catchment areas are the main sources of
rivers in the country. The rivers provide water for irrigated crops, livestock and fisheries. Investment
in infrastructure for water harvesting and storage alongside irrigation systems need to be prioritized
to build resilience and support CSA.
4.2.8	 Ministry responsible for finance
The ministry is responsible for fiscal and economic policies and strategies. It should provide adequate
financial incentives to CSA actors at different stages of various Agricultural Value Chains. Funding
for agriculture (crops, livestock and fisheries) should not be less than 10% of the national budget
as per the Maputo Declaration of 2003. Cascaded to the counties, a similar, if not higher, allocation
should go to the three sub-sectors. In order to lower prices of agricultural inputs and raise product
competitiveness, it is necessary for the National Treasury to institute targeted tax reliefs and subsidies
that will promote CSA.
4.2.9	 Regulatory agencies and support institutions
Regulatory agencies and support institutions are critical in ensuring enforcement of laws and
regulations. They will play an important role in setting standards; codes and guidelines; and ensure
compliance by stakeholders to CSA statutes and practices.
4.2.10	 The private sector
The private sector includes producers, farmers, processors, marketers and all other actors in the crops,
livestock, fisheries and forestry value chains. Majority of these actors contribute to greenhouse gas
emissions which impact on climate change. Climate change has negatively affected productivity
and sustainability of the value chains. The actors will collaborate with the national and county
governments in implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures. They will also participate
in the development and review of CSA policies and strategies; legislations and investment ventures.
4.3
RESOURCE MOBILIZATION
The implementation of KCSAS strategy will require a total of KSh. 500 billion (US$ 5.0 billion)
during the ten (10) year period (2017 to 2026). A summary of the financial requirements for the key
thematic areas in CSA is presented in Table 1.
