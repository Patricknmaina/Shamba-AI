Preface
FAO recognizes the pivotal role of seeds in agricultural development. Increasing the
quality of seeds can increase the yield potential of the crop and is one of the most
economical and efficient inputs to improve crop production and productivity. The FAO/
Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) Technical Conference
on Improved Seed Production (Kenya, 1981) and at the Expert Consultation on Interstate
Movement of Seeds (Rome, 1986) identified the concept of Quality Declared Seed as a
strategy to increase the availability of quality seed for the agricultural community. After
further discussions and studies of this concept, FAO Seed and Plant Genetic Resources
Service, in consultation with relevant experts, in 1993 produced and published specific
crop guidelines as Plant Production and Protection Paper No. 117 Quality declared seed
– Technical guidelines on standards and procedures.
Over the past decade the principle of Quality declared seed has been widely used
as a source of practical information on seed standards for a wide range of crop species
and agroecologies for the development of the agricultural sector. It also been used to
establish seed quality standards for seed relief interventions following natural disasters
or calamities. The system was conceived to make the best possible use of the resources
available for seed quality control under limited-resources conditions and gave major
responsibilities and participation to seed producers and dealers. However, changing
circumstances and needs in the seed sector have prompted a critical review of both, the
purpose and the content of the publication and with this objective FAO convened an
Expert Consultation in Rome in May 2003 to review, update and improve the document.
While following the same general format some changes were introduced to the revised
version including:
¾ A more explicit recognition of the role of national policies and the impact of some
recent national and international obligations on seed provision
¾ A clearer explanation on how QDS can accommodate local varieties
¾ More crop species, the list of which now includes 92 species (21 of them comprising
open pollinated varieties and hybrids as well as one synthetic variety)
¾ Standardized procedures to facilitate the operation of the scheme and thereby
enhance the schemes’ implementation.
As a result of these studies and deliberations this revised version of Quality declared
seed has been prepared and will also be available on the FAO Web site.

Introduction
The Expert Consultation Meeting on the Revision of the Quality Declared Seeds was
held at FAO, Rome, from 5 to 7 May 2003. The Meeting was opened by Mr Mahmoud
Solh, Division Director of the Plant Production and Protection Division (AGP). Mr
Solh welcomed the participants on behalf of the Director-General of FAO and also on
behalf of the Division. He thanked the participants for their time and effort in coming
to Rome and recalled that the objective was to review the Quality Declared Seed, FAO
Plant Production and Protection Paper 117, which was first published in 1993. He
wished the Expert Consultation every success in their discussions.
Mr Arturo Martínez, Chief, Seed Plant Genetic Resources Service (AGPS), thanked
the consultants for their advanced preparations for to the meeting and anticipated
that the Meeting would be able to produce a revised and updated edition of Quality
Declared Seed to meet the new and expanded needs of the FAO member countries.
The agenda (Annex 1) as proposed was adopted.
Mr Martinez was invited to take the Chair. It was agreed that Mr Michael Larinde
be Vice-Chairperson and Mr Michael Turner be Rapporteur.
A list of participants is given in Annex 2.
The meeting was reminded of the existing document on Quality Declared Seed
– Technical Guidelines for Standards and Procedures which was first published by
FAO in 1993 as Plant Production Paper 117. All participants received a copy of this
document together with other relevant papers in advance of their coming to Rome.
Mr Cadmo Rosell outlined to the meeting the background of the Quality
Declared Seed (QDS) concept. An Expert Consultation on Interstate Movement of
Seeds enunciated the concept in 1986. A draft document was prepared at the Expert
Consultation on Quality Declared Seed held in Rome, in October 1989. After further
work by AGPS and its consultants, the specific crop guidelines were finalized. The first
edition of Quality Declared Seed, Technical Guidelines for Standards and Procedures
was published as FAO Plant Production and Protection Paper 117.
Mr Larinde gave a concise summary of the issues, which  AGPS would like to
consider during the review of the 1993 edition of the Quality Declared Seed document.
These were as follows:
a. The need for a selective review of seed standards of some of the crops.
b.  Filling missing data gaps with respect to moisture content and threshold for
important seed-borne diseases.
c.  Broadening the scope of the crop coverage of QDS to include more tropical crops
for which there are no seed quality control guidelines.
d. The need to suggest ways that the QDS system could be used for quality control
of varieties developed under participatory varietal breeding.
e. Improvement of QDS to take into account compliance with UPOV and TRIPS
agreements.
f)  Possible inclusion of information on GMO testing in QDS.
g) The determination of critical seed quality attributes to be used as the bottom line
for local seed trade if all the minimum standards of the present set of attributes
could not be met.

The general consensus, prior to the presentation of each consultant, was that the
improvement of and widespread use QDS could be facilitated through its adoption
by governments and organizations for use ensuring where there was a lack of quality
seeds available for farmers.
The consultants presented their papers, which has been prepared according to the
guideline provided, in their Terms of Reference. (Annex 3).
The main points arising from the presentations of the Experts were as follows:
a. More efforts should be made by FAO to create more international awareness on
the QDS system, including placing the revised edition of QDS on FAO’s web
site.
b. It should be made more widely known that QDS puts the responsibility for seed
quality offered for sale on the seed trader with the national government playing
a less demanding role as would have been the case in a fully developed Seed
Quality Control Scheme. To this end, it was emphasized that QDS can form a
starting point for a full Seed Quality Control Scheme.
c. The need to increase the number of crops included in the scheme in the revised
document. In order to strengthen this proposal, FAO staff pointed out that
the information in QDS are frequently used as seed standard references when
evaluating seed supplies for emergency relief.
d. A version of QDS for vegetatively propagated crops should be developed as
soon as possible.
e. QDS should make provision for the inclusion of ‘Local Varieties’, selections
of indigenous crops (especially vegetables) and lines produced by participatory
plant breeding.
f. The revised edition of QDS should be widely circulated by all means possible.
The consultants referred to the possible developments arising from the increased
use of GMOs. It was acknowledged that the International Seed Testing Association
(ISTA) was already studying methods for detection of GMO seed material during seed
testing. While it was generally thought that seed production of GMOs would remain
in the hands of large companies and organizations, the Chairman reminded that some
governments had already released GMO material for multiplication by farmers.
The Chairman indicated that FAO planned to discuss GMOs at another forum.
Different aspects of seed quality attributes were discussed and the salient points
were gathered to be carried forward for inclusion in the final draft document to
be recorded during the session devoted to preparation of a draft revision of QDS
Document.
The collective points proposed by the Experts in their individual reports were
discussed in addition to those arising during the meeting. These were incorporated
into the draft document wherever appropriate.
During the final discussions, the Expert Consultation approved the following four
proposals stressing that:
a. FAO should take adequate action to promote the implementation of the QDS
system at global level.
b. FAO should finalize the proposed Revised Edition of QDS at the earliest time
possible.
c.  FAO should make the QDS Document as widely available as possible, including
its posting on Internet.
d.  FAO should organize a further Expert Consultation to consider a quality
assurance scheme for vegetatively reproduced (asexual) crops.

Introduction

The final session informed the Chairman that the Expert Consultation had finalized
the draft document and had incorporated all the salient points agreed during the course
of the meeting into the document.
The meeting outlined the four agreed proposals to the Chairman.
The meeting then adopted the revised QDS Report.
At the Closing Ceremony the Chairman and Vice-Chairman thanked the participants
for their contributions during the course of the meeting and looked forward to the
completion of the revised edition of Quality Declared Seed.
On behalf of all the visiting consultants, Mr George thanked Mr Martínez and all
the staff in AGPS for their kind hospitality and their help during the course of the
meeting.

Quality declared seed
ORIGINS OF QUALITY DECLARED SEED
In many countries where there were no developed seed industries, national seed
projects and programmes were established during the 1970s and 1980s with the support
of external funding from bilateral and multilateral donor agencies. This was a response
to the need for more secure seed supply systems, which could deliver good quality
seed of improved and new varieties to farmers. Seed was regarded as a strategic input to
crop production and that is still true today. However, the expectations of seed industry
development at that time were optimistic. It was believed that the formal seed sector
would steadily replace traditional methods of seed provision once farmers realized the
benefits of improved seed.
Rigorous seed quality control was seen as a key tool to achieve that goal, reflecting
the evolution of regulatory systems in countries with a more industrialized agriculture.
The strong influence of governmental organizations at that time also favoured the
adoption of rather centralized systems of seed quality control. Consequently, quality
control was often made compulsory for seed produced within the formal sector, while
the proportion of seed actually supplied through those formal channels remained low.
The reasons for these unfulfilled expectations are complex, and they have been
critically analyzed in recent years, particularly through the review of the activities
of FAO Seed Improvement Development Program (SIDP) and through a series of
Regional Seed Policy and Programmes Meetings conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa,
Near East and North Africa, Asian and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean
regions and the Central and Eastern European Countries, Commonwealth of
Independent States and other Countries in Transition.
As a result, there is now a clearer understanding of the problems of developing a
sustainable seed system and recognition of the key part played by national policies,
regulatory frameworks and market economies. In addition, many other elements
of the wider agropolitical environment have also changed in the past decade, for
example increasing concerns about the use of genetic resources and the conservation
of agrobiodiversity, the pressures towards trade liberalization, the protection of
intellectual property and the increasing role of the private sector in developing
countries. All of these have implications for seed supply and as a result, seed issues have
come increasingly into the political arena. However, at a practical level, there is still
much to be done to improve the supply of quality seed, improved and new varieties to
farmers in many developing countries.
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE QUALITY DECLARED SEED SCHEME
It is not intended that QDS should compete with existing schemes of seed quality
control, or that the work of other specialized organizations should be duplicated.
However, as in the original document, it is still recognized that the requirements of
full seed quality control makes demands that can be a burden on the government
agencies which have to implement it. With constraints in government budgets, the
resources to run a full fledged seed quality control scheme may simply not exist.
One solution to this problem might be to charge for all services so that the costs are
covered, as has been done in many industrialized countries in recent years. However,

Quality declared seed system

the additional seed costs and the administrative burdens of collecting the fees may
prove counterproductive.
It must also be recognized that there are serious risks if a quality control scheme
is not run properly. The essence of this scheme is that the label on the seed package
represents quality of the contents and all the activities that contributed to that. If the
reputation of the label is lost through poor supervision, the raison d’être is undermined.
At worst, the label may have a negative impact.
Against this background, the purpose of QDS is to offer an alternative, which can
be used for those crops, areas and farming systems in which highly developed seed
quality control activities are difficult to implement or make relatively little impact.
In particular, it may more easily accommodate varieties of crops, which, for different
reasons, do not easily fit within a conventional seed quality control scheme. Being
implemented primarily by seed producers, it also facilitates local seed production
initiatives, which have advantages for many of the staple grain crops. These crops often
present problems for seed supply because the premium, which can be charged for seed
over the grain price, is limited by the option of farm-saved seed.
One major challenge in designing a QDS scheme is to provide flexibility in
implementation while retaining the basic principles of quality assurance, which can
achieve the confidence of stakeholders and play a part in developing the seed sector.
It would be counterproductive to elaborate QDS to the point where it would have
the same problems as existing quality control schemes. Therefore, despite the advance
of technologies in seed and variety testing, QDS is still a practical system, which is
relatively easy to apply.
To summarize, QDS is an attempt to reconcile the continuing need to improve seed
supply to farmers with the desire to reflect and accommodate the diversity of farming
systems, particularly in the more difficult areas where highly organized seed systems
do not function well. QDS is a relatively open scheme, which meets the needs of
farmers in a flexible way but without compromising basic standards of seed quality. It
may therefore contribute to the wider policy objective of diversifying the seed supply
system so that farmers may have more choice.
USES OF QUALITY DECLARED SEED
Over recent years, QDS has been of particular value for seed purchased for relief
purposes in emergencies. It serves as a reference scheme for such seed supplies because
national seed organizations are often unable to provide comprehensive documentation
for rapid international movement. However, this is only one example of the limitation
of existing formal seed systems to cope with special situations. There are other
potential suppliers, which would have an interest to enter the seed market but, because
of limited resources, would find the requirements of full quality control difficult to
satisfy. Examples include cooperatives, farmer groups, large private farms and NGOs
for whom QDS could provide a cost effective entry point to quality assurance.
QDS is not proposed as a global scheme, which countries would formally recognize
or adopt as a basis for trade. However, if the principles of the scheme are accepted by
countries or regional groups, it may facilitate seed movement between countries if no
other such scheme is available. Likewise, the standards set out here may provide a basis
for regional seed schemes to develop their own standards according to their specific
trading needs. The standards and procedures quoted in this document may also be used
as a source of guidance for seed purchase agreements or production contracts.
To summarize, the approach embodied in QDS and the crop standards listed in this

Quality declared seed
7
document may be regarded as a resource, which can be used by interested parties in
different ways to advance the overall goal of improving the supply of quality seed and
new varieties.
The crops considered are listed alphabetically by scientific name. The species are listed
under major crop production groups and within each group in alphabetic order. For
the scientific nomenclature GRIN (USDA, ARS, National Genetic Resources Program,
Germoplasm Resources Information Network) has been used as the taxonomic reference.
In the specific case of Beta vulgaris, as an exception and in order to offer complementary
information, Mansfeld’s classification is followed (Mansfeld’s Encyclopedia of
Agricultural and Horticultural Crops, P. Hanelt & IPK (eds.) 2001, Springer).
CURRENT POLICY CONTEXT
In recent years, much more attention has been given to the need for clear national
policies on seeds and varieties and related issues. This is a response to the changing
structure of the seed industry. In the time of primary seed industry development,
the government was the main player in the seed sector in most developing countries.
Therefore, the government could control and manipulate the seed supply as an
instrument of agricultural development, largely on its own terms. Subsidies were often
provided to parastatal seed corporations, which had little prospect of commercial
viability but were intended to provide seed of local staple food crops for other funded
projects or for the national extension service.
With the diversification of the seed sector and the increasing role of private companies
and other suppliers, it is necessary to ensure that there are clear principles guiding the
development of the sector. A policy is intended as a statement of the government’s
intentions for the seed sector and related activities. Placing this statement in the public
domain provides a basis for consistent decision making which will in turn promote a
stable national seed industry to meet the diverse needs of farmers. The means by which
seed quality is assured to purchasers is an essential element in such a policy statement.
One major policy issue in the seed industry both nationally and internationally
is the handling of genetically modified organisms/varieties, commonly referred to
as GMOs. In particular, the question of contamination of conventional varieties by
GMO varieties is extremely sensitive, in view of the adverse public reaction to GMOs
in some countries. However, the methods of detection of GM traits are unlikely to
be available for general use by QDS producers. As regards the production of GM
varieties no special standards are proposed here because such varieties are likely to
remain proprietary for the foreseeable future and therefore not needed; however, it
must also be recognized that GMO material has been released by a small number of
government agencies for general use. Despite the great importance of this issue, no
general standards or recommendations have been proposed within the QDS scheme.
At the national level, seed crops grown as QDS would be subject to the same controls
on GMOs, or isolation from them as would apply to any other crops grown for seed.
ROLE OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS
Governments or their seed agencies need to give formal recognition to QDS in order
to endorse its position as an effective quality assurance scheme. This could probably
be achieved by means of a revision of the existing regulations on seed quality control,
rather than as a more fundamental change in the Seed Law.
The successful implementation of QDS will also require some input by a technical
agency to provide support services such as variety lists, check inspections, seed testing
and to provide training in these specialized skills. Governments may therefore need

Quality declared seed system
8
to consider how best to arrange for these services to be available, and on what basis.
However, it should be emphasized that with the QDS scheme the responsibility for
seed quality is with those who are distributing the seed; but the scheme also provides
some protection for farmers and growers against unscrupulous seed traders.
It is further recommended that national governments should see the provision of
QDS as one element in a wider seed policy, which would address all the key issues
affecting the seed sector. Specifically, the adoption of QDS would give practical
effect to objectives 5 and 6 of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources
and a number of Activities of the Global Plan of Action (GPA) for conservation
and sustainable utilization of PGRFA, which deal with relationships amongst plant
genetic resources, seed and sustainable agriculture. For this reason, FAO believes that
the adoption of QDS as a means to improve seed quality in a wider range of genetic
material is a positive contribution to maintain genetic diversity and strengthen seed
security.
RELATIONS TO EXISTING INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR
ACTIVITIES
Several international organizations are involved in seed/variety issues and it is
appropriate to mention how QDS may relate to their activities.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) offers a
number of schemes, which enable the seed certification for a range of different crops
intended for international movement. These schemes are implemented by national
certification agencies that have been validated by OECD. The key element of OECD
certification is that the crop is inspected in the field and found to conform to the
required standards of variety, identity and purity. When the certification process is
complete, OECD labels are fixed to the seed sacks. The OECD schemes are widely
used for international seed trading but they are only available in countries, which have
had their certification procedures validated by OECD. The OECD schemes do not
specify seed quality standards. These would normally be covered by the contractual
arrangements between the producer/seller and the buyer.
When the opportunity for OECD certification exists for international trade, it will
normally be used. However, quality declared seed may fill the gap for seed movement
between countries, which are not members of the OECD schemes, or where other
OECD criteria cannot be met.
The International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) develops and publishes a set
of Rules for testing seed of a wide range of species. These are intended as standard
procedures to ensure the uniformity of seed testing results. ISTA does not specify
any quality standards, which should be achieved; it only describes the procedures and
optimum conditions for carrying out tests in order that the results are fully comparable
between different laboratories.
In North America, the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA) publishes
similar procedures for seed testing. The use of ISTA or AOSA procedures is strongly
recommended for testing seed produced under QDS.
The Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) seeks to safeguard
the property rights of plant breeders in their varieties. Such rights are only available
within a country, which has passed a law on plant variety protection. In practice, the
use of QDS for quality assurance is unlikely to have major implications for variety
protection unless varieties were being produced and moved between countries in order
to escape the payment of royalties due to the breeder. If a Plant Variety Protection law
exists in a country, it should be a condition of QDS that all crops of protected varieties

are produced with the agreement of the breeder, so that a royalty can be collected on
the seed produced. That could form part of the declaration made by a QDS producer
when a seed crop is registered.
Regional Seed Associations have been established in several parts of the world in
recent years. Their purpose is to promote trade in seeds by facilitating commercial
contacts and, to some extent, by harmonizing regulations between member countries
if the governments are supportive. This could extend to offering a regional umbrella
scheme for seed quality control, and QDS could provide a basis for such a scheme.

Description of the quality declared
seed scheme
GENERAL
To improve the quality of seed being offered for sale in countries where human and
physical resources for quality control are limited FAO has introduced the ‘quality
declared seed’ system, which makes use of resources already available in seed
production organizations. The system is designed to provide quality control during
seed production, which is less demanding on government resources than other more
developed seed quality seed systems, but is adequate to provide good quality seed both
within countries and in international trade.
The system is based on four principal points:
1. A list of varieties eligible to be produced as Quality Declared Seed is established.
2. Seed producers are required to register with an appropriate national authority.
3. The national authority will check at least 10 percent of the seed crops.
4. The national authority will check at least, 10 percent of the seed offered for sale
under the designation of Quality Declared Seed.
The following are the minimum standards, which must be achieved and procedures
to be followed before a seed lot can be designated as Quality Declared Seed, which
may be of any crop species for which eligible varieties are available and for which
appropriate specific standards and procedures have been published. It shall be open for
any national government to authorize the use of this designation when it is satisfied
that these procedures have been followed and that the standards have been achieved.
DEFINITIONS
Varieties
The term ‘variety’ is synonymous with the term ‘cultivar’ as defined in the
International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants, 1980, Article 10: ‘The
international term cultivar denotes an assemblage of cultivated plants which is clearly
distinguishable by a group of characters (morphological, physiological, cytological,
chemical or others) and which, when reproduced (sexually or asexually), retains its
distinguishing characters’.
Type of varieties:
1. Varieties developed through conventional breeding methodologies.
2. Local varieties that have evolved over a period of time under the particular agro-
ecological conditions of a defined area. A local variety is sometimes also called a
‘land race’ or an ‘ecotype’.
3. Varieties developed through alternative plant breeding approaches such as
participatory plant breeding.
Quality declared seed
Seed produced by a registered seed producer which conforms to the minimum standards
for the crop species concerned and which has been subject to the quality control

Quality declared seed system
12
measures outlined in the Guidelines. For seed of local varieties and varieties developed
through participatory plant breeding the minimum standards may be different from
varieties developed through conventional plant breeding approaches. The initial seed
source shall be Maintainer’s Seed or any class of certified seed. Some certified seed, for
example of hybrids, may be excluded. Quality Declared Seed may reproduce Quality
Declared Seed only from a seed lot that has been officially tested and approved. There
may be certain cases where the national controlling authority will wish to impose a
limitation on the number of generations for technical reasons.
Maintainer
A person or organization responsible for maintaining a variety eligible to be produced as
Quality Declared Seed and for producing the initial and recurring seed of it for starting
multiplication. This seed must conform to the standards for Quality Declared Seed and
may be called ‘Maintainer’s Seed’. All Maintainers shall also be Seed Producers.
Seed producer
Any company, co-operative, individual or institution fulfilling the requirements
outlined in these Guidelines.
Seed trader
Any company, cooperative, individual or institution, which offers seed for sale under
the designation Quality Declared Seed. A Seed Producer may also be a Seed Trader.
Seed conditioning
Post-harvest operations of seed, which may include drying, cleaning or treatment with
chemicals (when possible environmentally friendly).
Off-type
Plants or seeds, which do not conform to the characteristics of the variety.
National Variety Registration Committee
The national government would appoint a committee responsible for the maintenance
of a register of eligible varieties.
ELIGIBILITY OF VARIETIES
A variety shall be eligible to produce Quality Declared Seed when at least one
national government has included it in a list of eligible varieties following review
of appropriate evidence by a national variety registration committee or equivalent
institution approved by the government. A person or organization submitting a
request for a variety to be eligible must submit the following information to the
appropriate national authority:
1. The name of the variety.
2. For a bred variety: (a) a statement giving the origin of the variety and the breeding
procedure used in its development; (b) a description of morphological and other
characteristics of the seeds and plants, which distinguish the variety from all other
varieties; (c) a statement defining the agroecological zone for which the variety
is suited based on evidence from properly conducted trials from more than one
growing season (to be eligible, a variety should normally show some advantage
for cultivation and use); (d) a statement showing the procedures to be followed
for maintaining the variety; (e) a statement of any special requirements essential

Description of the quality declared seed scheme
13
to safeguard genetic purity during multiplication (e.g. limitation of generations or
extra isolation of seed crops).
3. For a local variety: (a) a statement giving the origin of the variety; (b) a simple
morphological description and its value for cultivation and use with an indication
of the agroecological zone for which the variety is suited; (c) a statement indicating
the procedures to be followed for maintaining the variety.
4. For a variety developed through participatory plant breeding methods: (a) a
statement giving the origin of the variety; (b) data obtained during the farmer
evaluation process; (c) a description of the main characteristics, which distinguish
the variety from other varieties; (d) a statement defining the agroecological
zone, for which the variety is suited, a statement indicating the procedures to be
followed for maintaining the variety.
The applicant shall be required to submit to the authority samples of a specified size
to be used as authentic standard samples of the variety for any tests of varietal purity or
authenticity, which may be required in relation to Quality Declared Seed.
The authority shall agree to the procedures for the maintenance of the variety
following the proposals in previous paragraphs. Any special requirements, which may
apply to the variety such as limitation of generations within Quality Declared Seed,
shall be published in the list of eligible varieties.
REGISTER OF SEED PRODUCERS
The government shall designate an appropriate authority to approve seed producers and
to maintain a register of them. To be eligible for registration, a seed producer must:
¾Have access to seed which is of an eligible variety and suitable for further
multiplication.
¾Have suitable land for the proposed production programme, or be in a position to
contract with suitable farmers to have the seed grown.
¾Nominate person(s) suitably qualified in seed production technology to supervise
and exercise quality control over the production and conditioning. The area of
seed crop which each of such persons may supervise must be limited to enable the
supervision to be effective. The authority may refuse to accept a nomination when
there is evidence that a person is not suitably qualified.
¾Have access to suitable seed conditioning equipment and storage facility to deal
with the proposed production.
¾Have access to a seed testing laboratory with trained staff capable of conducting
the required tests.
PRODUCTION OF SEED
Maintainer’s Seed shall be at least of the standard of Quality Declared Seed and shall
be produced and distributed under the responsibility of the maintainer for each variety
shown in the list of eligible varieties according to the agreed procedures and plan for
its production. Seed standards (germination, physical purity, etc.) and some of the
field standards (weed infestation, diseases) of seed produced from local varieties and
participatory varieties are similar, but differ mainly concerning genetic purity.
Quality Declared Seed shall be produced by a registered seed producer who shall be
responsible for the quality of the seed. Quality control measures shall include:
1. Ensuring that seed production fields have satisfactory previous cropping histories
for the proposed seed crops and that the seed used to sow the fields is eligible to
produce Quality Declared Seed.

Quality declared seed system
14
2. Ensuring that the seed crop is well grown and arranging for remedial measures to
be undertaken, such as rogueing of off-types, weeds and disease plants attacked
by major seed borne diseases as may be necessary.
3. Inspecting the seed fields according to the procedures outlined in the appropriate
crop standards and ensuring that only, those, which meet the standards, are
approved.
4. Ensuring that the identity of the seed at harvest is maintained and that it is
delivered for conditioning in identified containers.
5. Ensuring that seed conditioning is performed in such a way as to preserve the identity
and varietal purity of the seed. In addition, to ensure that the seed is maintained at
the appropriate moisture content, for individual species, whether in open storage,
non-moisture proof or vapor proof containers. Individual countries, or in some
cases, areas within countries will have their own standards and requirements for
seed moisture content for each of the species produced. In general, for open storage
the acceptable levels are: cereals 13 percent, legumes 10 percent and small seeded
vegetables eight percent. However, care must be taken to maintain each specie’s
optimum moisture content in locations with fluctuating ambient temperatures
and/or relative humidities. The levels for storage in moisture proof containers are
generally 2-3 percent lower than those for open storage. (See Annex 3)
6. Securing appropriate samples of the lot and submitting them to test in a seed
testing laboratory. Ensuring that only seed lots are included for which laboratory
results show that the standards specified for the crop are met before permitting
the seed to be designated as Quality Declared Seed. Where there are no national
procedures for seed sampling and testing, the ISTA or AOSA provide suitable
procedures for most crops.
7. Keeping records of all activities, inspections, test results and completing the
Quality Declared Seed Declaration.
The registered seed producer shall be responsible for submitting to the appropriate
authority information on the planned production, including details of the seed to be
multiplied and the location of all seed fields and, during the season, reports of the
inspections and test results and the outcome of the production.
Labelling
Quality Declared Seed shall be labelled when offered for sale. The label shall be affixed
by a registered seed producer. Each label will show at least the following: the crop
species; the name of the variety; the words quality declared seed; a reference number
of the seed lot; the name of the seed producer; germination percentage, physical purity
percentage, net weight, date of test, details of any chemical treatment and the name of
the responsible authority. Labels shall be attached in such a manner that it is impossible
for them to be reused once they have been removed. In some cases, it is possible for the
information to be printed directly on the container. Containers should be fastened or
sealed according to national requirements.
Supervision by government
The government shall designate the authority or authorities to control the use of the
term Quality Declared Seed.
The authority (ies) shall have the following duties:
1. To review and decide upon applications for varieties to be eligible for the
production of quality declared seed and to maintain an up-to-date list of those
varieties accepted as eligible. Such a list shall include the name of each variety, the
name and address of the maintainer and any special requirements.

Description of the quality declared seed scheme
15
2. To review and decide upon applications for registration as seed producers and
to maintain an up-to-date register of those which are authorized, to review
nominations of responsible persons.
3. To ensure that inspections are made on at least 10 percent of the seed fields for the
production of Quality Declared Seed. The results of these check inspections will
be reviewed in relation to the standards.
4. To obtain seed samples from at least 10 percent of Quality Declared Seed offered
for sale and to submit these samples for tests. These tests shall include tests
for germination and purity and may include such other tests as are considered
appropriate (e.g. plot tests for varietal purity or laboratory tests for seed-borne
diseases or moisture content). The results of all tests will be reviewed in relation
to the standards.
5. To receive and store the authentic samples of eligible varieties.
6. To initiate appropriate action when there is evidence that seed which does not
meet the appropriate standards has been designated as Quality Declared Seed.
PENALTIES

National governments shall provide that persons found to be using the term Quality
Declared Seed wrongly shall be guilty of an offence and subject to an appropriate
penalty. For example: a seed crop found at check inspection to be below standard
should not be permitted to be harvested as seed; seed offered for sale when it is shown
to be below standard should be withdrawn from the market; persistent or very flagrant
breaches of the standards should be penalized by withdrawal of registration from the
seed producer; or any other penalties provided in the national law.
ORGANIZATIONAL FRAMEWORK
A government wishing to authorize the production of Quality Declared Seed on its
territory should ensure that the following official organizations are established, staffed
and equipped.
SEED CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE AND VARIETY REGISTRATION
Duties: to advise the government on all matters concerned with the development of
the seed industry; to review and advise the government on the availability of varieties
and plant genetic resources, both nationally and internationally; to establish lists of
varieties eligible to produce Quality Declared Seed on the basis of evidence submitted
with applications. These duties may, if desired be divided between different bodies.
Representation on these bodies should be from the Ministry of Agriculture, agricultural
research, the seed quality control organization, the extension service, farmers,
cooperatives or seed trade organizations; in certain cases it may be desirable to include
persons from specialized product users (e.g. bakeries, breweries or food processors).
SEED QUALITY CONTROL ORGANIZATION
Duties: to control and monitor all activities under the system; to establish a register
of authorized seed producers; to check inspect a proportion of seed crops and to
sample and test a proportion of seed on offer for sale as Quality Declared Seed; to take
appropriate action against seed producers or nominated technicians who are ineffective
in quality control; to provide training for seed producers and nominated technicians;
to take appropriate action against seed traders when there is evidence that Quality
Declared Seed is being offered for sale when it is below the standards.

second during flowering and the third at maturity. Additional inspection during
flowering may be undertaken to check pollen shedders in the seed parent.
5.2 Technique
5.2.1
Before entering the field. The inspector will confirm with the seed grower the
exact location of the seed field, the identities and proportions of the parents of which
it is said to be composed and the previous cropping of the field. Fields of more than 50
ha should be divided into areas of 50 ha maximum, each to be inspected separately.
5.2.2
In the field. The inspector will examine plants from both parents to confirm
that they conform to the characteristics of the parents used and that the proportions
of the seed to pollen parents have been correctly established. The inspector will then
examine the boundaries of the field to confirm that the isolation requirement is satisfied.
The field will be generally surveyed and an estimate made of the weeds present and of
the disease situation (4.5 and 4.6). During each inspection the inspector will examine
carefully 150 plants from the female and 150 plants from the male parent by sampling
at least 30 plants from five places at random. The number of plants not conforming to
the true characteristics of each of the parent lines will be counted and if the number of
off-types in either male or female rows exceed three (out of 150) the field should be
rejected. At inspection during flowering the inspector will additionally examine 300
plants in the female rows taken from five separate places distributed at random in the
field (60 plants from each place) and count the number of plants that are shedding or
have shed pollen. If the number of pollen bearing plants exceeds three (out of 300), the
field should be rejected.

counted and if the number of off-types in either the female or the male rows exceeds
three the field should be rejected (paragraph 4.4). At inspections during flowering the
inspector will additionally carefully examine 300 plants in the female rows taken from
five separate places distributed at random in the field (60 plants from each place) and
count the number of plants which are shedding or have shed pollen; if the number of
pollen bearing plants exceeds 3, the field should be rejected.

that they conform to the characteristics of the parents said to have been used and that
the proportions have been correctly established (paragraph 4.2). The inspector will
then examine the boundaries of the field to confirm that the isolation requirement
(paragraph 4.1) is satisfied. The field generally will next be surveyed and an estimate
made of weeds present and the disease situation (paragraphs 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7). During
each inspection the inspector will examine carefully 150 plants from the female and 150
plants from the male parent. These plants will be taken from five separate places (30
plants from each place) distributed at random in the female rows and an equal number
in the male rows. The number of plants not conforming to the characteristics of either
parent will be counted and if the number of off-types in either the female or the male
rows exceeds three, the field should be rejected (paragraph 4.4). At inspections during
flowering the inspector will additionally carefully examine 300 plants in the female
rows taken from five separate places distributed at random in the field (60 plants from
each place) and count the number of plants, which are shedding or have shed pollen; if
the number of pollen bearing plants exceeds three, the field should be rejected.

Before entering the field. The inspector will confirm with the seed grower the
exact location of the seed field, the variety, which is said to be and the two previous
croppings of the field. Fields of more than 50 ha should be divided into areas of 50 ha
maximum each, to be inspected separately and a lot number is assigned to that field.
4.2.2
In the field. The inspector will confirm that the medic plants generally conform
to the characteristics of the variety and will then examine the boundaries of the field to
confirm that the isolation requirement (paragraph 3.1) is satisfied. The field generally
will next be surveyed and an estimate made of the weed plants present and of the
disease situation (paragraphs 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7). During this survey, the inspector will
examine carefully 150 plants taken at random, 30 at each of five separate places in the
field; the number of plants not conforming to the characteristics of the variety and the
number of plants of other species with similar seed size will be counted separately. If
either the number of off-types or the number of other medic species exceeds three, the
field should be rejected (paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3).

4.2  Technique
4.2.1
Before entering the field. The inspector will confirm with the seed grower the
exact location of the seed field and the variety which it is said to be and the previous
cropping of the field. Fields of more than five ha should be divided into areas of five ha
maximum each, to be inspected separately.
4.2.2
In the field. The inspector will confirm that the carrot plants generally conform
to the characteristics of the variety, and will then examine the boundaries of the field to
confirm that the isolation requirement (paragraph 3.1) is satisfied. The field generally
will then be surveyed and an estimate made of weed plants present and of the disease
situation (paragraphs 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7). During the survey, the inspector will
examine carefully 150 plants taken at random, 30 at each of five separate places in the
field; the number of plants not conforming to the characteristics of the variety and the
number of plants of other crop species with similar seed size will be counted separately.
If either the number of off-types or the number of other crop species with similar seed
size exceeds three, the crop should be rejected.
