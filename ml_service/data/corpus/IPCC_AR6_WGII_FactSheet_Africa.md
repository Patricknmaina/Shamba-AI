SIXTH ASSESSMENT REPORT
Working Group II – Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability
Fact sheet - Africa
Water
Recent extreme variability in rainfall and river discharge across
Africa have had largely negative and multi-sector impacts across
water-dependent sectors (high confidence). Projected changes
present heightened cross-cutting risks to water-dependent sectors,
and require planning under deep uncertainty for the wide range of
extremes expected in future (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.7}
Africa is one of the lowest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change, yet key development sectors have already
experienced widespread losses and damages attributable to human-induced climate change, including biodiversity loss, water shortages,
reduced food production, loss of lives and reduced economic growth (high confidence). Limiting global warming to 1.5°C is expected to
substantially reduce damages to African economies, agriculture, human health, and ecosystems compared to higher levels of global
warming (high confidence). {ES-Ch9}.
Climate Change Impacts and Risks
Ecosystems
African biodiversity loss is projected to be widespread and
escalating with every 0.5°C increase above present-day global
warming (high confidence). Above 1.5°C, half of assessed
species are projected to lose over 30% of their population or area
of suitable habitat. At 2°C, 7–18% of terrestrial species assessed
are at risk of extinction, and over 90% of east African coral reefs
are projected to be destroyed by bleaching. {ES-Ch9; 9.6}
Food
In Africa, agricultural productivity growth has been reduced by 34%
since 1961 due to climate change, more than any other region.
Future warming will negatively affect food systems in Africa by
shortening growing seasons and increasing water stress (high
confidence). Global warming above 2°C will result in yield
reductions for staple crops across most of Africa compared to 2005
yields. Climate change poses a significant threat to African marine
and freshwater fisheries (high confidence). Under 1.7°C global
warming, reduced fish harvests could leave 1.2–70 million people in
Africa vulnerable to iron deficiencies, up to 188 million for vitamin A
deficiencies, and 285 million for vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty
acids by mid-century. {ES-Ch9; 9.4; 9.8}
Economy
Climate change has reduced economic growth across Africa,
increasing income inequality between African countries and those
in temperate northern hemisphere climates (high confidence).
Across nearly all African countries, gross domestic product (GDP)
per capita is projected to be at least 5% higher by 2050 and 10–
20% higher by 2100 if global warming is held to 1.5°C compared to
2°C. {ES-Ch9; 9.6; 9.11}
Cities and Settlements
Exposure of people, assets and infrastructure to climate hazards is
increasing
in
Africa
compounded
by
rapid
urbanisation,
infrastructure deficit, and growing population in informal settlements
(high confidence). High population growth and urbanisation in low-
elevation coastal zones will be a major driver of exposure to sea
level rise in the next 50 years (high confidence). By 2030, 108–116
million people in Africa will be exposed to sea level rise (compared
to 54 million in 2000), increasing to 190–245 million by 2060
(medium confidence). Under relatively low population growth
scenarios, the sensitive populations (people under 5 or over 64
years old) exposed to heat waves of at least 15 days above 42℃in
African cities is projected to increase from around 27 million in 2010
to 360 million by 2100 for 1.8℃global warming and 440 million for
>4℃global warming. {ES-Ch9; 9.9}
1
Heritage
African cultural heritage is already at risk from climate hazards,
including sea level rise and coastal erosion. Most African heritage
sites are neither prepared for, nor adapted to, future climate change
(high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.12}
Figure 1: Risks increase with increasing levels of global warming, as shown by this Burning
Embers figure for selected key risks from climate change in Africa. Increase in risks are
assessed for the levels of global warming above pre-industrial (1850–1900). All three risks
are assessed to have already transitioned to moderate risk by the recent level of global
warming 2010–2020 (1.09°C), and are expected to complete the transition to high risk before
2°C. {Figure 9.6; Table SM 9.1}

SIXTH ASSESSMENT REPORT
Working Group II – Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability
Adaptation options
Adaptation costs will rise rapidly with global warming (very high
confidence). Increasing public and private finance flows by billions
of dollars per year, increasing direct access to multilateral funds,
strengthening project pipeline development and shifting more
finance to project implementation would help realise transformative
adaptation in Africa (high confidence). Concessional finance will be
required for adaptation in low-income settings (high confidence).
{ES-Ch9; 9.4}
Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programmes,
such as cash transfers, public works programmes and healthcare
access,
can
increase
resilience
to
climate
change
(high
confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.10; 9.11}
Gender-sensitive and equity-based adaptation approaches reduce
vulnerability for marginalised groups across multiple sectors in
Africa, including water, health, food systems and livelihoods (high
confidence). {ES-Ch9; Box 9.1}
Early warning systems based on targeted climate services can be
effective for disaster risk reduction, social protection programmes,
and managing risks to health and food systems (high confidence).
{ES-Ch9; 9.4}
Migration
Most climate-related migration observed currently is within
countries or between neighbouring countries (high confidence).
Over
2.6
million
and
3.4
million
new
weather-related
displacements occurred in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018 and
2019. Climate change is projected to increase migration (high
agreement, medium evidence). With 1.7°C global warming by
2050, 17–40 million people could migrate internally in sub-
Saharan Africa, increasing to 56–86 million for 2.5°C (>60% in
west Africa). {ES-Ch9; Box 9.8}
Barriers
Technological,
institutional
and
financing
factors
are
major
barriers to climate adaptation feasibility in Africa (high confidence).
Adaptation generally is cost-effective, but annual finance flows
targeting adaptation for Africa are billions of US dollars less than
the lowest adaptation cost estimates for near-term climate change
(high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.3; 9.4}
Adaptation Options and Barriers
2
Health
Mortality and morbidity will escalate with further global warming,
placing additional strain on health and economic systems (high
confidence). Above 2°C of global warming, distribution and
seasonal transmission of vector-borne diseases is expected to
increase, exposing tens of millions more people, mostly in west,
east and southern Africa (high confidence). Above 1.5°C risk of
heat-related deaths rises sharply (medium confidence), with at
least 15 additional deaths per 100,000 annually across large parts
of Africa. {ES-Ch9; 9.10}
Governance for climate resilient development includes long-term
planning,
all-of-government
approaches,
transboundary
cooperation and benefit-sharing, development pathways that
increase adaptation and mitigation and reduce inequality, and
implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
(high confidence). Robust legislative frameworks will facilitate
effective design and implementation of climate change response
options (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.4}
Climate Resilient Development
Climate-related research in Africa faces severe data constraints,
as well as inequities in funding and research leadership that
reduces adaptive capacity (very high confidence). From 1990–
2019, research on Africa received just 3.8% of climate-related
research funding globally. {ES-Ch9; 9.1}
Innovative index-based insurance schemes can help transfer risk
and aid recovery, including in food systems (medium confidence).
{ES-Ch9; 9.8; 9.11}
Agricultural and livelihood diversification, agroecological and
conservation
agriculture
practices,
aquaculture,
on-farm
engineering and agroforestry can increase resilience and
sustainability of food systems in Africa under climate change
(medium confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.8}
Ecosystem-based adaptation can reduce climate risk while
providing social, economic and environmental benefits (high
confidence). Maintaining indigenous forest benefits biodiversity
and reduces greenhouse gas emissions, but afforestation can
harm water security and biodiversity. {ES-Ch9; 9.6; Box 9.3}
The diversity of African Indigenous knowledge and local
knowledge systems provide a rich foundation for adaptation
actions at local scales (high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.4; Box 9.1;
Box 9.2}
Climate information services that are demand driven and context
specific, combined with climate change literacy can be the
difference between coping and informed adaptation responses
(high confidence). {ES-Ch9; 9.4}
