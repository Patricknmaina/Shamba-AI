Conservation Agriculture
Foreword
Over the last couple of decades, conservation agriculture has gained increas-
ing interest in Africa and worldwide. This approach to farming is very attrac-
tive for African farmers: it boosts yields, saves labour and money, and con-
serves the soil and the environment. It appeals to all categories of farmers –
from small-scale subsistence farmers, to high-tech commercial producers. It
can be used in all climates and on all soils where it is possible to grow crops.
And it appeals to the general public and to national leaders as a policy to
promote and approve.
Conservation agriculture contributes significantly to meet three of the Millen-
nium Development Goals.
Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
Conservation agricul-
ture helps farmers produce more food – for themselves and for the market.
It helps stabilize yields, especially during drought. It uses less labour and
fewer expensive inputs than conventional agriculture.
Goal  7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Conservation agriculture
produces a healthy, productive soil, halts erosion, reduces river pollution,
increases the amount of organic matter in the soil, and takes carbon diox-
ide out of the atmosphere.
Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development
Conservation
agriculture is a global movement. It brings development agencies, the pri-
vate sector, civil society, research institutions, local organizations and farm-
ers together to contribute to the other Goals.
Conservation agriculture also fits in well with two of the major NEPAD (New
Partnership for Africa’s Development) sectoral priorities: agriculture and the
environment.
This book explains why conservation agriculture has such promise. It shows
how farmers and extension workers can do it.
This book is the result of an initiative by a group of people from various insti-
tutions across Africa and throughout the world. This group includes farmers
and researchers, extension workers and policy makers, governments, non-gov-
ernment organizations and the private sector. A unique alliance for a uniquely
promising approach.
They have drawn on their own knowledge, on the work of their organiza-
tions, and on the successes of hundreds of thousands of farmers throughout
Africa. They have put all these experiences together into this guide: the first
manual on conservation agriculture covering the whole of Africa.
The method used to create this book – a “writeshop” involving more than 90
contributors – is highly appreciated. It shows an impressive will by a large
group from many different countries, from different walks of life, and with
different specializations and interests, to come together and produce a prod-

uct that all agree upon. The feeling of joint ownership will help the message of
conservation agriculture spread much more quickly than if a single person
had attempted to write this book alone.
It is our hope that this book will be distributed widely, and will be read by
many. More important, we urge readers to put to use the information it con-
tains. While the book is intended especially for extension workers and other
agricultural service providers, we would also recommend that students in
schools and universities read it. So should many farmers, and those who rep-
resent our peoples in various forums on agriculture and food security.
Finally, we want to recognize the international aspect of conservation agricul-
ture. This book is African. But it reaches even further out. It will be a major
input into the World Congress on Conservation Agriculture, to be held in Nai-
robi in October 2005 under a NEPAD arrangement and with the African Con-
servation Tillage Network. This congress marks a new beginning for a conti-
nent with an increasing will to get together to influence global policies and
decision making.
We thank all involved in producing and distributing this book, and those
charged with transforming its messages into practical use. Most of all, though,
we hope that our farmers will be able to use conservation agriculture to bring
prosperity to their families and for their societies.

Conservation Agriculture
Preface
Over 60% of Africans depend on some form of farming for their sustenance
and livelihoods. Agriculture remains vital for the continent’s development and
economic growth. So the recent stagnation or decline in farm productivity in
many parts of Africa is a major concern. For many communities and coun-
tries, this has translated into chronic food insecurity and growing poverty.
Households and communities are increasingly vulnerable, as their only resource
– their land – can no longer sustain them.
Africa is witnessing severe degradation to its farmlands. Much of this degra-
dation can be attributed to common, but exploitative, farming practices –
ploughing that destroys the soil structure and degrades organic matter, burn-
ing or removing crop residues, monocropping, and so on.
Soil and water management practices that sustain and enhance the produc-
tivity of arable soils are a must for Africa. They are a vital part of the long-term
solution to food insecurity and poverty.
Conservation agriculture aims to overcome these problems. It consists of three
simple principles – disturb the soil as little as possible, keep the soil covered, and
mix and rotate crops. These principles can be put into practice in many differ-
ent ways. Farmers throughout Africa, and throughout the world, are begin-
ning to adopt them. They have seen their yields rise, their soil gain in fertility,
and their labour needs fall.
But conservation agriculture must be promoted actively if it is to spread rap-
idly. Grassroot players (farmers, extension workers, input suppliers, etc.) of-
ten lack information on what to do and where to do it. This manual aims to fill
this gap.
This manual
This manual tries to do the following:
It explains what conservation agriculture is, and why it is important.
It describes how to use conservation agriculture principles in the field.
It highlights the issues and challenges that farmers and extension person-
nel may encounter when they adopt and adapt conservation agriculture.
It suggests ways to adapt and disseminate this approach to farming.
It gives examples of experiences with conservation agriculture in real life.
This manual is part of a larger effort to develop and promote conservation
agriculture in Africa and worldwide. It is designed to reflect the experiences
and views of many conservation agriculture practitioners (farmers, research-
ers and support organizations) to respond to the looming hunger and environ-
mental degradation in sub-Saharan Africa. It aims to enhance knowledge and
awareness on conservation agriculture and promote the adoption and adap-

xii
Conservation Agriculture
tation of this approach throughout Africa. It is the first truly Africa-wide manual
on conservation agriculture.
African farmers face a bewildering variety of conditions: highland and low-
land, tropical and temperate, high and low rainfall, rich and poor soils, large
and small farms. They grow a huge range of crops. Some farmers are commer-
cially oriented; others eat everything they grow. It is impossible for one book to
cover all the different variations.
Fortunately, this is not necessary. Conservation agriculture is not a single set
of techniques – there is no one “best practice”. Rather, its three principles can
be applied in different ways in different situations. This book outlines these
principles (on page 4), then shows how to adapt them to suit the particular set
of circumstances that you – the farmer or extension worker – face. It is up to
you to decide on what is best for you. Innovate, test and adapt the techniques
in this book, and encourage your friends and neighbours to do the same.
The manual also reflects the character of conservation agriculture – holistic
and multi-disciplinary. It also describes how conservation agriculture relates
to other key areas that farmers are concerned with: socioeconomic issues, cul-
ture and traditions, marketing, and livestock.
This manual is intended primarily for Africa’s farmers and extension workers:
the people who stand to benefit directly from conservation agriculture. It is
written in a simple style, avoiding jargon, so it is easy to understand, and easy
to translate into local languages. Many of the illustrations can be enlarged or
adapted for use on posters or training materials.
The book should also prove useful for others interested in conservation agri-
culture: agricultural researchers and policymakers, NGO staff, trainers, teach-
ers and students. It should serve as a comprehensive resource on conservation
agriculture in Africa and worldwide.
How this manual was prepared
The initial idea for this manual came from a meeting in Zambia, when over 40
researchers and field practitioners from Africa met to prepare for the Second
World Congress on Conservation Agriculture (held in Brazil in 2003). The large
number of papers and posters gathered for this meeting formed a rich poten-
tial basis for a comprehensive manual on conservation agriculture in Africa.
The International Institute of Rural Reconstruction (IIRR) developed the con-
cept of a manual further, and discussed the idea with RELMA, ICRAF’s Re-
gional Land Management Unit. RELMA provided a start-up fund. FAO, CTA
and IFAD also provided valuable financial support. The resulting manual was
to be ready for the third World Congress, held in Nairobi in October 2005.
A small consultative group of key stakeholders was formed into a steering
committee, which decided that IIRR and the African Conservation Tillage

xiii
Conservation Agriculture
Network (ACT) be the lead agencies. IIRR was designated as manager and
overall project coordinator.
A group of key stakeholders met in November 2004 in Nairobi to generate a set
of themes and topics for the manual. The same group identified various prom-
ising practices and suggested organizations that practise conservation agri-
culture, as well as resource persons and individuals who might generate case
materials and manuscripts on various topics. IIRR then invited them to pre-
pare manuscripts on the selected topics and to present them at a “writeshop”.
The Karen writeshop
The writeshop (an intensive, 2-week workshop) was held in Karen, near Nai-
robi, on 18–29 April 2005. The contributors brought their manuscripts with
them, along with other printed materials, photographs and conservation agri-
culture equipment. In all, some 60 farmers, extension staff, scientists and prac-
titioners from 14 African countries participated, as well as specialists from
Brazil and Europe. Another 30 contributors were unable to attend the write-
shop but submitted manuscripts for discussion by the participants.
The writeshop began with a series of presentations by participants on various
aspects of conservation agriculture. The participants were then divided into a
number of groups, each focusing on a specific theme, such as “field prepara-
tion” or “economics”. These groups were asked to write a draft chapter on
their theme, based on the manuscripts that had been prepared for the write-
shop and on their own knowledge and experience. Each group prepared a
draft chapter, which they presented to the plenary.
The other participants commented on the drafts, asked questions, and sug-
gested additions or changes. The individual groups then revised their drafts.
A team of editors assisted with drafting and revising the text, and artists drew
illustrations to accompany it.
The groups presented their revised drafts to the plenary a second time, along
with the illustrations, and the other participants were able to make further
suggestions. The editors and artists again helped revise the text and illustra-
tions. By the end of the writeshop, the groups had completed drafts for each of
the chapters in the book you are reading.
The groups were fairly fluid: individual participants were able to move from
group to group, so contributing to the detailed drafting of more than one chapter.
Throughout the writeshop, participants wrote about their specific experiences
with conservation agriculture. These cases appear in boxes in the text. They
provide valuable examples of how conservation agriculture works in practice.
After the writeshop, considerable restructuring and rewriting were necessary
to eliminate overlap among the various chapters and to ensure the style was
clear and consistent. This was done by the chief editor, who also commis-
sioned new artwork to fill in gaps.

xiv
Conservation Agriculture
Through the writeshop process, the initial manuscripts were revised substan-
tially or were completely rewritten. The information they contained was se-
lected, sifted, and combined with ideas from other sources, and was distrib-
uted throughout the manual. A single section in the book may contain infor-
mation provided by many different participants. This means it is not possible
to label a particular chapter or section as the work of a particular participant.
The “authors” of the manual are thus the contributors listed on page xviii:
both those who attended the writeshop and those who provided manuscripts.
Writeshop advantages
The sequence described above is an adaptation of the writeshop approach
pioneered by IIRR at its headquarters in the Philippines. IIRR-Africa has used
this approach to produce extension and information materials on a wide range
of subjects.
Writeshops have several advantages over conventional methods of producing
a publication. They speed up the production process, taking full advantage of
the participants’ expertise. The process of writing, getting comments, revising
and illustrating takes place at the same time, considerably shortening the of-
ten-difficult process of writing, editing and publishing. A large number of par-
ticipants contribute to each topic: in effect, the writeshop provides an oppor-
tunity for technical peer review by a large number of reviewers, as well as
pretesting for understandability and field relevance by a group of the intended
readers.
In addition, writeshops bring together a large number of people from various
institutions and walks of life, each with different perspectives and expertise.
They are an excellent training and networking opportunity, with individuals
learning about each other’s work and exchanging ideas and experiences that
will be of value for them when they return home. It is hoped that the relation-
ships and networks forged during the writeshop will continue long into the
future.
Structure of this book
This book is divided into 14 chapters.
Chapter 1, What is conservation agriculture?, explains the principles of conser-
vation agriculture, and describes the benefits it can bring to farmers who adopt
it. It compares conservation agriculture with conventional farming practices.
It also briefly describes the history of the approach worldwide and in Africa,
and outlines some challenges facing its rapid spread.
Chapter 2, Converting to conservation agriculture, tells readers what to expect
in the first few years after they adopt this new approach to farming. It lists
some questions farmers should ask when considering switching to conserva-
tion agriculture, and describes how to find the answers.

Conservation Agriculture
Chapter 3, Field preparation and planting, describes how to prepare a field for
conservation agriculture, various ways of planting crops, and how to work
out how much seed and fertilizer to use.
Chapter 4, Keeping the soil healthy, introduces the concept of soil health – which
depends on the amount of organic matter in the soil. It shows how to tell
whether your soil is sick, and what to do to nurse it back to health.
Chapter 5, Soil cover, discusses the importance of keeping the soil covered, and
the two main ways of doing so: using cover crops and mulch. It especially
addresses a major problem that many farmers face when they first adopt con-
servation agriculture: the choice of a cover crop and how to obtain seeds.
Chapter 6, Crops and cropping systems, discusses various types of cropping
systems (intercropping, sequential cropping, and so on), the benefits of crop
rotation, and factors to consider when choosing which crops to grow.
Chapter 7, Controlling weeds, discusses the vital topic of how to control the
weeds that will take over the fields unless the farmer manages them properly.
It describes various ways to control them: by maintaining soil cover, by me-
chanical weeding, or using herbicides. It gives special attention to using the
right amount of herbicides, in a correct and safe way.
Chapter 8, Conserving soil and water, describes various soil and water conser-
vation technologies that can be combined with conservation agriculture.
Chapter 9, Livestock, covers three issues relating to livestock and conservation
agriculture: feeding animals, protecting fields from livestock, and training ani-
mals to pull conservation agriculture equipment.
Chapter 10, Harvesting, marketing and input supplies, addresses issues that farm-
ers are likely to encounter in harvesting, storing, processing and marketing
their produce, and in obtaining inputs and credit for their conservation agri-
culture operation.
Chapter 11 is entitled Should you adopt conservation agriculture? It poses (and
answers) some questions that farmers may have about conservation agricul-
ture before they adopt it: How does it benefit me? How much does it cost? Is it
profitable?, and so on. For each question, it shows how farmers can work out
the answers themselves, so they can make an informed decision on what to
do.
Chapter 12, Conservation agriculture and people, explores the social and cul-
tural dimensions of this approach. It looks at five areas: the roles of women
and men, cultural beliefs, HIV/AIDS, farmers with disabilities, and young
people.
Chapter 13, Encouraging adaptation and adoption, is aimed primarily at exten-
sion workers, researchers and policymakers. It suggests various ways to test
and adapt particular conservation agriculture practices in a participatory way
with groups of farmers. It also provides ideas on how to promote conservation
agriculture through various extension approaches.

Chapter 14, Resources, includes the profiles and contact details of the con-
tributors, a list of resource organizations and websites, manufacturers of con-
servation agriculture equipment, and publications with further information
on this approach.
Throughout the manual, boxes describe how farmers, projects and research
institutions have applied conservation agriculture. These cases are drawn from
the experiences of the manual’s contributors, who represent a wide range of
countries and farming conditions from throughout Africa. For further details
on the individual experiences, please contact the individuals and organiza-
tions listed on page xviii (see addresses in Chapter 14).

Conservation Agriculture
M
ARIA ERRO used to struggle to grow
enough food on her half-hectare
plot in Karatu district, in northern Tan-
zania. She had no oxen to plough her soil.
She had to borrow seed from kind-hearted
relatives and her neighbours in Rhotia vil-
lage. After her husband died, she could
not do all the work – planting, hoeing,
weeding – by herself.
She managed to grow enough maize and
beans to feed her six children and four
grandchildren for only four months of the
year. The family had to make do with only
two meals a day. Sometimes there was
only enough food for a single meal. She
was late paying school fees. When her chil-
dren fell ill, she couldn’t afford medicine.
It was a tough life.
Maria’s life changed dramatically in Oc-
tober 2002, when she learned how to use an approach called conservation agricul-
ture. Instead of hoeing the soil, she left the dried stalks and leaves from the previous
crop on the surface. She learned how to plant maize seed directly through this mulch,
using an implement called a jab-planter.
Between the maize rows, she planted lablab – a legume that spreads quickly, covers
the soil with a dense, leafy mat, and produces an edible seed. The lablab smothered
the weeds, freeing her of the backbreaking task of weeding the plot. The lablab also
fixed nitrogen in the soil, so her maize crop benefited. She harvested six bags of
maize, instead of the two or three she had got in previous years.
She planted beans during the short rains, and for the first time, she was able to
harvest enough for her family to eat. There was enough left over for the next season’s
seed, and some to sell as well.
Thanks to conservation agriculture, Maria has to do less work, her yields have gone
up, and she has become an independent, confident member of the community.
“It was a miracle”, she says, “I will practise conservation agriculture forever.”

Introduction
C
ONSERVATION AGRICULTURE aims to produce high crop yields while reducing
production costs, maintaining the soil fertility and conserving water. It is
a way to achieve sustainable agriculture and improve livelihoods.
Conservation agriculture has three basic principles:
Disturb the soil as little as possible
Keep the soil covered as much as possible
Mix and rotate crops.
We will look at each of these in turn.
Disturb the soil as little as
possible
In conventional farming, farmers plough
and hoe to improve the soil structure and
control weeds. But in the long term, they
actually destroy the soil structure and con-
tribute to declining soil fertility.
In conservation agriculture, tillage is re-
duced to ripping planting lines or making
holes for planting with a hoe. The ideal is to
plant direct into the soil, without plough-
ing.
Keep the soil covered as much as possible
In conventional farming, farmers remove or burn the crop residues or mix
them into the soil with a plough or hoe. The soil is left bare, so it is easily
washed away by rain, or is blown away by the wind.
In conservation agriculture, crop residues left on the field, mulch and special
cover crops protect the soil from erosion and limit weed growth throughout
the year.
Mix and rotate crops
In conventional farming, the same crop is sometimes planted each season.
That allows certain pests, diseases and weeds to survive and multiply, result-
ing in lower yields.
In conservation agriculture, this is minimized by planting the right mix of
crops in the same field, and rotating crops from season to season. This also
helps to maintain soil fertility.
The three principles of
conservation agriculture
• Disturb the soil as little as
possible.
• Keep the soil covered as
much as possible.
• Mix and rotate crops.

Conservation Agriculture
To gain the full benefit of conservation
agriculture, all three principles have
to be applied at the same time. This is
the case with the ideal practice: direct
planting through a soil cover – what
Maria Erro does (page 2).
This ideal is not possible everywhere.
But farmers should try to go into that
direction as far as possible.
Because each farmer faces a different
situation, this may mean different
things. Some farmers may find it best to introduce a cover crop first. Others
might gain by reducing their tillage to “ripping” (using a narrow plough-like
implement that creates a small furrow without turning the soil over) or “pit-
ting” (digging planting holes with a hoe) as a first step towards conservation
agriculture. In a second step, these farmers can leave crop residues in the
field and start planting cover crops.
Practising conservation agriculture can be a challenge. It means a different
way of farming. Farmers may be reluctant to make the switch, and they need
to learn new skills. It also means a new mindset: for example, they have to
learn that a “clean” field is not the best.
But the benefits are real. Farmers quickly find that by applying these princi-
ples, they can save labour, reduce costs, and improve their soil’s fertility and
ability to hold water. That means higher crop yields. They can use the time
they have saved to expand the area they cultivate, or even to start other en-
terprises that earn more money. Conservation agriculture may at last give

Introduction
Why start using conservation
agriculture?
You might start using conservation agriculture for many reasons.
To improve your yields
Unlike the rest of the developing world, crop production
in Africa is not keeping pace with population growth.
Yields in many areas are actually falling. A major cause
of this is declining soil fertility, often caused by the way of
farming. The rising population has forced farmers to aban-
don traditional practices that left the land fallow for sev-
eral years, and to cultivate ever-smaller plots. Intensive
tilling and hoeing year after year can produce a hardpan
in the soil. That restricts root growth and stunts plants.
Rainwater pounds the bare soil, forming a surface crust that the water cannot
penetrate. It runs off, taking the valuable topsoil with it. Erosion in some places
is so severe that there is little soil left.
To get a good yield, farmers often apply more and more fertilizer. With less
moisture in the soil, plants are more vulnerable to drought. They start to wilt
after a few days without rain.
Conservation agriculture enables farmers to reverse this trend. It prevents hard-
pans from forming, protects the soil, increases soil moisture, and restores soil
fertility, so stabilizing yields and improving production over the long term.
To reduce your production costs
Tilling the soil is expensive. Fuel and fertilizer prices and
labour costs rise continuously, while market prices of farm
products have fallen. Many farmers cannot recoup their
production costs by selling what they produce, so they
end up making a loss.
Conservation agriculture helps these farmers cut costs
while increasing their yields.
To overcome shortages of labour and farm power
Many farm households suffer from a severe lack of labour and farm power.
Hunger and malnutrition combine to make people weak, unable to work hard,
and vulnerable to disease. Young people are moving out, and HIV/AIDS and
malaria create a severe labour shortage. Many draught animals have died be-

cause of disease, or their owners have had to sell them to
pay for medical treatment and burials. A lack of farm
power forces farmers to look for other ways to farm.
Conservation agriculture enables these people to grow
more food with less work. It offers them a real chance to
improve their lives.
How conservation agriculture works
in different types of farms
The three principles of conservation agriculture (disturb the soil as little as pos-
sible, keep the soil covered as much as possible, and mix and rotate crops) can be
applied in a wide range of conditions. How farmers put them into practice
will vary from place to place, depending on many factors.
Conservation agriculture can be practised on different types of farms, with
different combinations of crops and sources of power. Here are some exam-
ples.
Hoe farming
Many African farmers cultivate by hand, using hoes. These farmers can prac-
tise conservation agriculture by digging small planting holes in lines, at care-
fully measured distances, leaving the rest of the soil unturned. If hoeing in
previous years has produced a hardpan, the holes must be deep enough to
break through this hard layer.
The farmers can put compost or manure in the holes to raise the soil fertility
and the water-holding capacity, then sow maize or beans.
They can sow cover crops between the
planting holes to protect the soil from
erosion and to suppress weeds. They
can pull weeds out by hand, or slash
them with a machete.
The next season, they can plant dif-
ferent crops in the same holes. It is not
necessary to dig through the hardpan
again, because the first season’s crop
roots will have penetrated deep into
the soil and will help water to seep into
the soil. So it is necessary to do hard
work of digging the pits only once.

Introduction
Smallholder farming with draught animals
Farmers who own (or can hire) oxen
or donkeys to pull implements can use
a different set of conservation agricul-
ture practices.
They can use a subsoiler to break up
the hardpan (if there is one). This is
usually necessary only in the first year.
If there is no hardpan, the farmers can
use an animal-drawn ripper to open
up a narrow furrow for planting seed.
The soil between these furrows is left
alone. It is possible to use rippers and subsoilers that sow seeds and apply
fertilizer at the same time, so saving time and work.
Before planting the crop, the farmers can use a hoe or knife-roller to kill weeds,
or apply herbicide using a sprayer or wiper. They sow a cover crop with the
maize crop to smother weeds and to reduce evaporation from the soil surface.
When harvesting the main crop, the farmers leave the residues and cover crop
on the field. That protects the soil from the sun and rain, and further controls
weeds.
Mechanized farms
Farmers with tractors can use conservation agriculture too. They can replace
their mouldboard ploughs, disks and harrows with rippers, subsoilers and di-
rect-drill planters.
Farming in harmony with
nature
Conservation agriculture means farming in
harmony with nature.
In a forest, the ground is covered with a per-
manent layer of litter. The soil is rich in or-
ganic matter and has many earthworms,
beetles and other tiny animals. There is a
wide range of different plants, all growing
together. Worms, beetles and other tiny ani-
mals mix the soil and recycle nutrients.
The same is true of conservation agricul-
ture.

Conservation Agriculture
Challenges to agriculture in Africa…
…and how conservation agriculture can help overcome them
African agriculture faces three major challenges:
Lack of labour – or rather, lack of farm power
Most African farmers cultivate their fields
by hand. Unlike farmers in many other parts of the world, they do not have machines and
equipment to help them. Many young people do not want to become farmers. They move
to town in search of education and less laborious work. The AIDS pandemic and malaria
make this labour shortage even more acute.
How conservation agriculture can help
Conservation agriculture eliminates ploughing
and controls weeds better than conventional farming, so it needs less labour. Farming
may become more attractive to young people, and more profitable too.
Low yields
African grain yields are low – perhaps no more than 1 ton/ha. That is less
than half what is needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the
number of malnourished and hungry people by 2015.
How conservation agriculture can help
It can significantly raise yields and can provide
many different types of food and feed.
Environmental degradation
Many older farmers remember when their villages were
surrounded by trees, and their soils were rich with humus. Today, slopes are bare and
rivers run brown with eroded soil.
How conservation agriculture can help
Conservation agriculture protects the land and
feeds the soil. It can halt and even reverse land degradation. That means cleaner rivers
and less sediment to clog reservoirs and irrigation channels.
At the outset of the season, larger scale
farmers use a knife-roller, sometimes
in combination with herbicides, to kill
the previous season’s cover crop and
weeds. In the first season of conserva-
tion agriculture, they may need to use
a subsoiler to break up the ploughpan.
They then use a direct-drill planter to
sow seeds. A post-emergence herbicide
kills any weeds that come up after
planting and before the crop canopy can cover the surface.
After harvest, the crop residues stay in the field. The farmer then sows a cover
crop to protect the soil until the next planting season.
Many farmers are able to use a combination of implements and different types
of power. For example, a hoe farmer may be able to hire a neighbour with a
tractor to subsoil her field. She can then choose among various options so she
gets the full benefits of conservation agriculture (see the table on page 9).

Conservation Agriculture
Different situations
Conservation agriculture can be used in all parts of Africa, except where it is
too dry to grow crops. It can be applied in various climatic zones and under
different conditions, though it may look very different from place to place.
In semi-arid lands, conservation agriculture retains water in the soil, keeps
the soil temperature even, and protects the land from erosion during heavy
downpours. Maintaining soil moisture is the main challenge in these areas,
so rainwater harvesting methods can be very useful to increase the amount
of water available for crops. Crops may be planted with wide spacing, and
there may not be enough moisture to grow a cover crop, so farmers may
have to rely on mulch or residue to keep the soil covered. Livestock are
important in these areas. Farmers may have to restrict grazing on their
fields to keep as much soil cover as possible.
In sub-humid and humid areas, weeds and erosion are likely to be more of
a problem. Crops are planted at closer spacings, and cover crops help sup-
press weeds and protect the soil.
On slopes, conservation agriculture can be used in association with ter-
races, contour grass strips and other erosion-control methods. Terraces al-
ready exist in many places; conservation agriculture can be used on them.
Where labour is scarce, perhaps because of HIV/AIDS, conservation agri-
culture enables farmers to produce good yields with less labour.
In densely populated areas, conservation agriculture increases yields on
small plots of land under intensive cultivation.
On good soils, conservation agriculture keeps the soil healthy and main-
tains yields. On poor soils, it is a good way to rebuild soil fertility and
enhance water-holding capacity, so increasing production.
Conventional vs conservation
Both conventional farming and conservation agriculture include a very wide
range of operations: field preparation, planting, fertilization, weeding, har-
vesting, and field operations after the harvest. The table on the next two pages
compares practices common throughout Africa with conservation agriculture.
There are, of course, many variations in both “conventional” and “conserva-
tion” approaches, so the descriptions are simplified and may not depict what
happens in a particular area.
Conservation agriculture means less work because it is not necessary to plough
the soil and weed as many times. It suppresses weeds and reduces erosion. It
improves the soil structure, ability to retain water, organic matter content and
fertility. All these lead to higher and more stable yields.

Introduction
Effects of conventional farming and
conservation agriculture
In African conditions, conventional farming can produce high yields in the
first few years after a virgin soil is ploughed. But then – all too often – the
problems begin. The table on the next few pages summarizes some of these
problems, and shows how conservation agriculture avoids them. Again, the
descriptions are simplified: not all conventional farming suffers from the prob-
lems listed in the table.
Improving food security
Conservation agriculture creates a win–win situation with numerous advantages. Here
are two particular ways it can improve food security:
Conserving soil moisture
Maintaining cover on the soil protects it from heavy rain and
conserves the moisture during dry spells. It reduces the soil temperature under the
intense sun. Combining conservation agriculture with measures to prevent erosion and
harvest water can raise yields significantly.
Increasing crop diversity
The crop rotations and intercropping in conservation agricul-
ture enables farmers to broaden their own diet, and sell a greater variety of produce.
Different crops have different rooting depths, so draw nutrients and moisture from differ-
ent layers. Overall yield levels should rise, even on depleted soils.
Indigenous conservation agriculture practices in Côte d’Ivoire
Many indigenous practices have elements of what we now call “conservation agriculture”.
It may be possible to build on or adapt these.
In the rainforest zone of southern Côte d’Ivoire, for example, Ebrié farmers traditionally
clear the land, then build small mounds 30 cm high before the rainy season starts. They
plant a combination of crops on the mounds: cassava, maize, groundnuts, okra and
tomato. The mounds ensure good drainage and enable humus to accumulate, concen-
trating fertility around the crops. The soil stays covered for 2 years. A bush or tree crop,
such as coffee, cacao, palm or rubber, is often introduced later.
Organic matter breaks down quickly in the hot, wet conditions. Heavy rain washes nutri-
ents away, leaving a poor, acidic soil and causing gullying. Farmers often abandon the
land after a few years.
One way to keep land productive is to continue growing cereals, cassava and other crops,
closely spaced to cover the soil. Leaving mulch on the surface and growing a permanent
cover crop of legumes such as Pueraria and Centrosema protects the soil and increases
the organic matter level. Applying organic and inorganic fertilizer several times during the
season (instead of all at once) allows crops to use the nutrients before they are washed
away. Planting tree crops can also help protect the soil from heavy rain.

being stored in the soil.
Ploughing turns the soil over,
allowing much of the
moisture to evaporate in the
air. On flat land, water forms
pools on the surface, or is
trapped above the hardpan,
causing waterlogging and
Organic matter binds soil into

soak into the soil easily

is stored in the soil, so is
available for crops. There is
no hardpan, so water can

ground. Mulch and cover
crops shade the soil surface,
so less water evaporates.
Repeated ploughing, disking,
harrowing and harvesting
reduces soil organic matter
and destroys the soil
structure.  Very fine, unstable
particles result. A hardpan –
a hard layer that water
cannot pass through – forms
at the ploughing depth.
Deep ripping may be
necessary to break up a
hardpan. Deep-rooted
legumes can also break it up.
The soil is disturbed very
little, so its structure stays
intact, and no hardpan forms.

Introduction
Other types of sustainable agriculture
Conservation agriculture is not the only type of “sustainable” agriculture and resource
management. It overlaps with various other approaches. Here are some:
Sustainable land management (or “land husbandry”) is a broad term that includes vari-
ous types of crop and livestock production that aim to produce good yields year after year,
while conserving soil and water resources. It does not necessarily include all three prin-
ciples of conservation agriculture (don’t turn the soil, keep the soil covered, and rotate
crops). Conservation agriculture is a type of sustainable land management.
Organic farming involves growing crops and livestock without using agrochemicals. It is
possible to do conservation agriculture in an organic way (without using fertilizers, herbi-
cides or pesticides), but many types of conservation agriculture use these agrochemicals
– but in small amounts and with care.
Agroforestry is a combination of trees and crops (or livestock), and is a form of “sustain-
able land management”. Agroforestry promotes soil cover and crop rotation, so may
contribute to a conservation agriculture system.
History of conservation agriculture
In the 1930s, soil erosion in the United States reached crisis proportions. The
problem was particularly severe in the Midwest, where millions of tons of top-
soil were blown away by the wind or washed into rivers, in what came to be
known as the “Great Dust Bowl”. Supported by the government, American
farmers started abandoning their traditional practice of ploughing. Instead,
they left the crop residues on the soil surface, and planted the next crop di-
rectly into the stubble.
Faced with similar problems, farmers in South America also took up conser-
vation agriculture. They sowed cover crops to protect the soil, and rotated
crops in order to maintain soil fertility. Because of the benefits, knowledge
passed quickly from farmer to farmer.
By the year 2000, conservation agriculture was practised on about 60 million
hectares of land worldwide, mainly in North and South America. Govern-
ment support has been important: in some states in Brazil, conservation agri-
culture is official policy. In Central America, Costa Rica’s Ministry of Agricul-
ture has a Department for Conservation Agriculture. Conservation agricul-
ture is used to cultivate over half the crop land in Paraguay, about one-third of
the land in Argentina, one-third in Brazil, and one-sixth in the United States.
The many South American conservation agriculturists are well organized in
local and national farmers’ associations. They are supported by institutions
from North and South America and have links with international agencies
such as FAO, GTZ and the World Bank. This support is essential to help farm-
ers to adopt quickly new approaches and technologies that many see as a
radical change in the way they farm.

Conservation Agriculture
Conservation agriculture in Africa
Conservation agriculture has great potential in Africa because it can control
erosion, produce stable yields, and reduce labour needs.
The story of conservation agriculture in Africa is not new. Across wide areas
of Africa, conservation agriculture principles used to be normal practice, be-
fore ploughs were introduced. Farmers would cultivate by hand, often with
hoes, rotating crops and fallowing fields for several years. Rising populations
and ploughs changed all that. European settlers and colonial regimes intro-
duced ploughs, and they quickly came to dominate farming because they ena-
bled farmers to open up more land quickly and cheaply. But just as in the
United States, the plough has gradually eroded Africa’s soils. Fertility and yields
have fallen, and many countries now face critical food shortages.
But not all Africa’s farmland was put to the plough, or to the deep-till hoe,
and pockets of conservation-friendly farming still remain.
Conservation agriculture emerged in several different places around the same
time in Africa. The most dramatic story comes from Zimbabwe and Zambia,
where conservation agriculture came to the rescue of the land. Starting on one
large-scale commercial estate in Zimbabwe, a combination of zero-tillage and
direct planting into deep straw mulch meant a slow but sure recovery for de-
Lesotho’s lost soil
The first missionaries arrived in Lesotho in 1833. They introduced ox-ploughs to the
Basotho people. The ploughs were a welcome alternative to hand cultivation. They spread
very fast, and Lesotho became a breadbasket for South Africa. It exported tons of food.
Soon people believed this was the only way land could be cultivated. Some women would
refuse to marry a man who did not own a plough. Tractors followed, and more and more
land was ploughed.
But the tractors and ploughs compacted the soil. Rain fell on the bare land, and washed
Lesotho’s precious topsoil into the rivers. Millions of tons of soil a year are lost now each
year. According to one estimate, there will be no topsoil left in Lesotho by 2040 (see Photo
19).
Soil fertility began to fall, and crop yields declined. More and more fields were planted to
maize, instead of a variety of crops in rotation. Farmers started to rely on artificial fertilizer
and other chemicals as the only way to increase the poor yields.
Lesotho can potentially produce an average of 4 tons of maize per hectare, but in 2003 to
2004, it produced less than one-tenth of that.
Recently, a few farmers have begun to practise conservation agriculture. They have found
that they can get good yields without ploughing: they dig small planting holes in lines, add
manure or compost, and sow maize seeds. They protect the soil surface with cover crops
or residues from the previous crop. They have begun to restore the fertility of their soils
and to stop erosion. For the first time in decades, there is hope for Lesotho’s farmers.

a broad range of crops, including root crops, legumes, vegetables and tree crops.

graded land. A moderate use of herbicides was needed to kill weeds. By the
mid 1990s, nearly 4000 hectares were under conservation agriculture – all on
large-scale farms. Efforts are presently being made to transfer this success to
some of the many new small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe.
In Zambia around the same time, a dedicated extension unit, supported by
donor funds, spread the message. Here, small-scale farmers found that conser-
vation agriculture worked on their farms too. Currently more than 100,000
small-scale farmers in Zambia have converted to conservation agriculture.
Large-scale farmers in Kenya, South Africa and Namibia also use conserva-
tion agriculture practices. In South Africa, no-till farmers’ clubs similar to those
in South America have been set up. Initiatives by government research and
extension agencies, donors and the private sector promote conservation agri-
culture for smallholder farmers in Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar,
Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and other coun-
tries. Various institutions conduct research on or promote conservation agri-
culture (see Chapter 14 for more information).
The most important researchers and promoters of conservation agriculture in
Africa are farmers themselves. Every farmer is a researcher, who experiments
every season on his or her farm. Farmers who find something that works are
likely to repeat it the next season, and to tell their friends about it.
Challenges for conservation
agriculture
Conservation agriculture has the potential to change the face of Africa. But its
success is not automatic. It faces various challenges.
Change of mindset
Switching to conservation agriculture involves a funda-
mental change of mindset. For example, farmers must drop their traditional
practice of preparing the land with a hoe or plough, and instead rely on “bio-
logical tillage” by the plant roots and earthworms. The switch also encourages
farmers to begin to see their farms as a business rather than merely a way to
feed their families.
Conservation agriculture involves radical changes in what extension services
do. An effective way to promote conservation agriculture is through farmer
field schools and other approaches that put farmers and their needs at the
centre, rather than seeing them as mere recipients of advice.
Such revolutionary changes require teaching, not only on the farm itself but
also within schools and colleges. Extension staff will need intensive training so
they can learn the necessary technologies. Field demonstrations and aware-
ness-creation campaigns will also be needed. The mass media must be har-
nessed to support the campaign.

Introduction
A certification system for conservation agriculture?
In some countries, farmers who grow food organically (without using fertilizers, pesti-
cides and other chemicals) can apply for a certificate. This allows them to sell their
produce as “organic” – which fetches a higher price than similar produce grown with
chemicals.
Elsewhere, farmers who sign a contract not to plough their land for several years can be
given cash rewards.
Could such systems be introduced for African farmers who practise conservation agricul-
ture?
Conservation agriculture increases the organic matter content of the soil – so it stores
carbon dioxide rather than releasing it into the air. That helps prevent climate change.
Could conservation agriculture farmers someday be rewarded for storing carbon?
Do these ideas sound far-fetched? Farmers in South America are debating them already!
See Chapter 12 for more on changing mindsets, and Chapter 13 for more on
promoting conservation agriculture.
Crop residues
Keeping the soil covered is important in conservation agri-
culture. But it can be difficult. Farmers have many uses for crop residues: as
fodder, fencing, roofing and fuel. Livestock keepers let their animals graze on
stubble. In drier areas, it is impossible to grow a cover crop in the dry season,
and crop residues are a vital source of animal feed.
If they are to keep the soil covered, farmers will have to protect their fields and
find alternative sources of fuel and fodder. In wetter, sparsely populated ar-
eas, this is easy. In drier areas, it is more difficult. Alternatives include fencing
animals out, reaching agreements with livestock owners on grazing rights,
and growing special plots of fodder and fuelwood.
Land tenure
Farmers can go a long way towards adopting the principles of
conservation agriculture with a minimum of investment on their farms. But
they may be reluctant to do so if they do not have clear rights to the land they
cultivate.
The importance, however, of the land tenure issue varies widely throughout
Africa. In some countries, lack of guaranteed tenure impedes all agricultural
development.
Other challenges
It can be hard to find seed (particularly of cover crops),
inputs such as herbicides, and equipment. Crops such as tef, which has very
small seeds, can be difficult to sow without disturbing the soil. And for various
reasons, it can be difficult for farmers to work in groups, form organizations
or get the support they need to begin practising conservation agriculture.

Conservation Agriculture
C
ONVERTING FULLY to conservation agriculture may take several years. You
should plan carefully what to do. For example, it may be best to begin to
grow a cover crop before reducing tillage. If you are lucky, you may see yield
increases in the first year. Or improvements may be more gradual, and yields
may even decline in the short term before your soil fertility has improved, you
can control weeds properly, and other benefits can make themselves felt. It is
important to be aware of the potential problems so you do not have false ex-
pectations and can plan what to do.
It can be difficult to switch to conservation agriculture. You have to accept
new ideas and learn a new set of skills. You may have to overcome some pre-
conceptions about what is “good farming”. In order to give the right advice,
extension personnel need to know not only about conservation agriculture
techniques, but also about how best to work with farmers to introduce them.
This chapter describes in brief the three stages you may go through when you
first start using conservation agriculture. Remember: this is a simplified ver-
sion! You may find yourself following a different set of steps, depending on
your own situation. The chapter also lists some questions to ask, and shows
where to find some of the answers in this book.
See Chapter 11 for more detailed questions to ask when you are considering
adopting conservation agriculture.
Three stages
Converting from conventional farming to conservation agriculture falls into
three main stages:
Before you start
First season
Second and following seasons.
Before you start
Choose a field to start conservation agriculture. Select part of a field where
you feel able to take a risk, have good conditions for learning, and have a good
chance of success. If you start with a field with good potential, you are likely
to see results quickly. When you have converted this field to conservation agri-
culture, you can start on the others – for example, on badly eroded fields on
slopes. However, if you have fertile fields on a hillside that are susceptible to
erosion, make sure you protect them before starting to use conservation agri-
culture. See Chapter 8 for how to do this.
Start small
Try out what works on one field first. Observe closely and learn
what works and what does not. You can then gradually extend what you
have learned to other fields and crops.

How a Kenyan farmer started doing conservation agriculture
A small-scale farmer in western Kenya had the opportunity to visit Nyanza, the neighbour-
ing province. There he learned about lablab for the first time. He took a bag of lablab
seeds home and planted it between the maize rows about 3 weeks after he had planted
the maize.
After he harvested the maize, the lablab continued to grow and covered the soil com-
pletely during the dry season. The farmer and his family could eat lablab leaves as a
vegetable, and mixed the beans with maize.
At the beginning of the next season, he slashed the lablab and left it on the soil surface.
He made small holes with a hoe and planted the next crop of maize.
Lesson
This farmer started small, with cover crops: he began with intercropping, then
gradually adopted other conservation agriculture practices.
Get support
Get together with friends and neighbours who are also inter-
ested in conservation agriculture. Learn from one another, and visit each oth-
ers’ fields to check on the crops, soil, weeds, pests and diseases. It can be diffi-
cult to start conservation agriculture if you are alone: get advice from your
extension worker or development agent, the local NGO, or other farmers who
can advise you.
Before the first cropping season, you may have to do some work to prepare
your field. Don’t worry – you will have to do this extra work only once!
You may have to do the following (see Chapter 3):
If the soil is compacted or has a hardpan
Use an animal- or tractor-
drawn subsoiler or a ripper.
If the soil has ridges and furrows
Plough once, preferably with a chisel
plough with a long log or iron bar pulled behind to remove the ridges and
make the surface more even. Remove rocks or stumps that get in the way.
This is necessary because direct planters work better on a fairly smooth
surface.
If the soil is acidic (has a low pH)
Add lime.
First season of conservation agriculture
Cover the soil Here are some ways to do this (see Chapter 5):
If there are crop residues nearby
Carry them to your field and spread
them on the soil surface as mulch. This takes some work, but costs little. If
you do not have any suitable residues yourself, perhaps you can get some
from your neighbours.
Plant a cover crop during the first season
Choose a cover crop such as
lablab with deep roots to improve the fertility and soil structure. Consider
using fertilizer on the cover crop to help it grow well. It will produce enough
mulch for you to grow food crops on the same field in the second season.

28
Conservation Agriculture
Grow a cover crop on a nearby field, then cut it and spread it on the soil
at the beginning of the second season. This cover crop can also produce
seeds for you to sow or sell to neighbours.
Control weeds
It is vital to control weeds, especially during the first few
years of conservation agriculture. Pull them by hand, slash them, or kill them
with herbicide (see Chapter 7). Then sow cover crops to prevent new weeds
from growing.
Don’t plough
Instead of ploughing, direct-plant your crops through the
mulch, or dig planting basins (Chapter 3) where you can sow seeds.
Grow crops
You can grow the crops you normally do, but add an intercrop
or rotate crops if possible. For example, you might grow maize as normal, but
add an intercrop of legumes (Chapter 6).
Leave the soil covered
At harvest, leave the residue on the field to cover the
soil during the dry season. Leave the cover crop growing, or plant another
main crop if you can.
Second and following seasons
There should now be enough cover on your field. If not, carry in extra residues
from nearby and spread them on your field. It is much simpler to prepare for
planting in the second season.
Check for weeds
Hand-pull them, slash them, or kill them with herbi-
cide.
Crop residues
Decide if it’s possible to produce enough crop residues on
the field for the third season. If not, grow some cover crops nearby, then
cut them and spread them on the conservation agriculture field in the third
season.
Questions to ask
Here are some questions to ask yourself when you are thinking about starting
conservation agriculture.
Equipment
Do you have the right equipment? You can practise conserva-
tion agriculture using a just a hoe. But you may want to use other equipment
to save you work:
Jab-planter
Ripper or ripper/planter
No-till planter
Sprayer or weed wiper.

29

Converting to Conservation Agriculture
If you do not own these implements, you may be able to hire them, or get
together with a group of neighbours to buy them for the group to share.
Seed
Can you get the right types of seed? Especially seeds of cover crops
such as mucuna or lablab. You may be able to buy them from dealers or get
them from neighbours.
Inputs
Will you be able to buy herbicide to control weeds and fertilizer to
improve yields? Can you make compost or use manure to help restore the soil
fertility?
Labour
Conservation agriculture generally saves work. But it may mean more
work in the first year – for example for field preparation before the rains, or for
weeding. Can you handle this work yourself, or can you get family members
or hire labourers to help you when you need?
Storage and markets
Conservation agriculture should help you grow more,
and will produce a greater variety of crops. Will you be able to harvest these
crops, dry them, and store them in your grain store? Will you be able to sell
them?
Livestock
You should try to keep livestock out of your fields, even after har-
vesting the crop. Can you find other ways to feed your animals if you do not
allow them to graze the stubble? Some possibilities (see Chapter 9):
Cut the cover crop and carry it to the animal pen.
Make hay or silage to feed to the animals in the dry season.
Plant an extra plot of forage to feed to the animals.
Sell less-productive animals so you have fewer to feed.
Arrange with your neighbours to graze animals somewhere else.
How a research institute introduced conservation agriculture
Farmers in northern Tanzania harvested low yields because their soils were infertile and
eroded, and had hardpans caused by repeated ploughing. Extension staff advised them
to plant on the contour, and introduced fertilizer and improved seeds. But yields stayed
low.
A donor-supported project tried to help by providing subsoiling services. This helped for a
few seasons, but as farmers continued to plough the field, the hardpan quickly came
back.
Researchers at Selian Agricultural Research Institute learned through an international
workshop about how Brazilian farmers use no-till and cover crops. The researchers
introduced cover crops and reduced tillage using hoes, and the Tanzanian farmers tested
them on their farms. The researchers later showed them how to plant directly through the
soil cover – first using a hoe, and later with direct planting equipment.
Lessons
Subsoiling may be necessary to repair the damage caused by ploughing, but
alone it is not sufficient. Support from development agencies may be crucial to promote
conservation agriculture.

Information and support
Do you have the skills you need to practise conser-
vation agriculture? Where can you get advice if you need it? Consider joining
a group of other farmers who are also trying out this new way of farming so
you can compare ideas and experiences. If no group exists in your village,
perhaps you could start one.
Where to find answers in this book
Conservation agriculture is made up of many different components. You choose
those that suit your own situation. This book presents these components sepa-
rately to make them easier to understand. But in reality, you will combine
components into an integrated system. And you will introduce them in a se-
quence that suits your conditions best.
Field preparation and planting
You can prepare the field and plant seed
with a hoe, using a jab-planter or an animal-drawn implement, or with trac-
tor power.
See Chapter 3 for more on field preparation and planting.
Keeping the soil healthy
Conservation agriculture improves the soil by in-
creasing the amount of organic matter. You can plant legumes that fix nitro-
gen in the soil. You can improve the soil fertility further by adding manure,
compost, green manure, or by applying artificial fertilizers. You may have to
add lime or ash to lower the soil acidity.
See Chapter 4 for more on how to improve the soil.
Maintaining soil cover
It is important to keep the soil covered throughout
the year. You can do this using cover crops or a mulch of residues from the
previous crop.
See Chapter 5 for guidance on how to use cover crops and mulch.
Crop rotations and combinations
You can choose among many different
combinations of main crops and cover crops. You can grow these as intercrops
(sowing two crops in the field at the same time), relay crops (sowing one crop
before the previous one is harvested), or rotations (sowing a different crop
each season).
See Chapter 6 for more on crop rotations and combinations.
Controlling weeds
Cover crops and mulch help suppress weeds, but you
must still control weeds in conservation agriculture. You can hand-pull weeds,
remove them with a hoe or machete, or control them using herbicide. In time,
there will be fewer weed seeds in the soil, so weeds will become less of a prob-
lem.
See Chapter 7 for more on how to control weeds.

31

Converting to Conservation Agriculture
Controlling erosion and harvesting water
Conservation agriculture reduces
erosion by encouraging rainwater to soak into the soil, preventing runoff. On
steep slopes and heavily degraded land, you may have to build terraces, bunds
and drains to control erosion. In dry areas, you can use structures such as
half-moon basins to harvest water and make it available to the crop. You can
combine conservation agriculture techniques with these measures.
See Chapter 8 for ideas on how to combine soil conservation measures and
water harvesting techniques with conservation agriculture.
Managing livestock
You should try to keep livestock away from your fields
throughout the year. You may have to tether animals, fence land to keep them
out, or make agreements with the community to limit or prohibit grazing on
stubble or on fallow fields. Animals may need an alternative source of feed –
such as plots of fodder grasses.
Farmers’ choices
You can choose among many different conservation agriculture practices. Here are some
things that may affect your choice.
What is the soil type?
What is the rainfall, and at what times of year does it fall?
What is your farm size?
How much labour do you have? Men, women, children, elderly, hired labour…? At
what times of year? (Many people migrate in search of work at certain times of the
year.)
What types of crops do you want to grow?
What implements do you have (or can you get)? Hoes, planters, rippers, sprayers…?
What draught power is available? Donkeys, oxen, camels, tractors…? Or do you and
your family have to rely on your own muscles and sweat? If you do not have access to
draught power, you may have no alternative: you may have to turn to conservation
agriculture in order to survive.
What inputs are available? Seeds, manure, compost, artificial fertilizer, herbicides,
pesticides…?
How much financing is available? Credit for implements, field preparation, inputs,
marketing…?
What information is available? You may be able to get advice from extension work-
ers, NGO staff, input suppliers, traders, other farmers, the mass media – and of
course, manuals like this.
Because individual circumstances vary, it is not possible to prescribe a single best way to
do conservation agriculture. You may decide to use an animal-drawn ripper, followed by
direct seeding of maize and a mucuna cover crop. Your neighbour may prefer to make
individual planting pits before sowing maize and lablab. Both approaches can produce
good yields.
You must be able to choose the practices that suit your conditions. Extension workers and
development agents must be ready to advise you so you can make your own decisions.

32
Conservation Agriculture
See Chapter 9 for more on managing livestock in conservation agriculture.
Equipment
Conservation agriculture requires different types of equipment
from conventional agriculture. You no longer need mouldboard ploughs, disks
and harrows. You can continue to use hoes and dibble sticks, but it might be
worthwhile to invest in special equipment such as rippers, direct drills and
jab-planters. Hand weeding is possible on a small scale, but conservation agri-
culture generally uses slashers, sprayers and wipers to control weeds.
See Chapter 3 for more on field preparation and planting equipment, and
Chapter 7 for weed-control equipment.
Inputs, post-harvest storage and marketing
Conservation agriculture uses
some of the same types of inputs as conventional farming (such as fertilizers
and crop seeds). But it also needs certain other types of inputs that may be
new, such as cover crop seeds and herbicide. You may also plant new types of
crop in a rotation, and you may have to harvest and sell unfamiliar types of
produce. Better yields may lead to extra storage requirements.
See Chapter 10 for more on input supplies and post-harvest activities.
Finance and economics
You – and other farmers – have to be convinced that
you will benefit from conservation agriculture before you will adopt it. It is a
good idea to keep careful records of each farm operation, and work out how
much labour and money you put in, and how much profit they earn. You can
use simple methods to work this out. You should also see other benefits that
are harder to measure in money terms: river water is cleaner, there is more
water in wells, and erosion is checked.
See Chapter 11 for details of these methods.
Hope for Tseoa
Tseoa Khoanyane almost gave up hope in 1998. His 1.5 hectare, steeply sloping field in
Ha-Mosuoe in Qachas Nek District, Lesotho, was riven by gullies. His maize yield had
fallen from 240 kg to just 60 kg. In despair, Tseoa gave up growing crops on the land.
But 5 years later, in 2003, he was introduced to conservation agriculture. Instead of plough-
ing the land with a tractor or oxen, he dug contour furrows on his deserted field. He put a
lot of plant residues into the gullies. The vegetation slowed down the rush of water, and
silt started to build up. He built stone bunds on eroded parts of the field, and laid mulch on
the ground. He dug basins to collect water in preparation for planting in November 2004.
Animals damaged some of his basins, but he did not give up. He now has a good crop on
the land he had earlier deserted.
“I am expecting a very good harvest of maize and beans”, he says. “Whenever I walk
through the farm and see the crop, I get very excited. I am glad I embraced conservation
agriculture.”

Sociocultural issues
Conservation agriculture may have different implica-
tions for men and for women. Women may prefer to grow more food crops,
while men may want to sell crops for cash. Conservation agriculture requires
less labour, so makes it easier for people affected by HIV to grow food. It is also
attractive for young people who might otherwise have lost interest in farming.
There may be benefits if neighbours also adopt conservation agriculture to-
gether, sharing costs of equipment and marketing produce together.
See Chapter 12 for a discussion of these and other sociocultural issues.
Promoting and adapting conservation agriculture
Conservation agriculture
requires farmers and extension workers to be open to new ideas and to learn a
new set of skills. It is ideal for participatory extension approaches such as farmer
field schools and farmer-to-farmer extension. Because conservation agricul-
ture is still relatively new to Africa, much research is still needed – both by
research institutions and by farmers themselves – to adapt the systems to the
specific situations.
See Chapter 13 for more on promoting and adapting conservation agriculture.
What are the risks?
Conservation agriculture can prove very beneficial. But some things might not
work right for you at the start – as often happens when trying something new.
Learning
All farmers have to learn how to use conservation agriculture be-
fore they can reap its full benefits. For example:
Farmers who are not used to leaving crop residues in the field sometimes
make simple mistakes – such as leaving them in bunches instead of spread-
ing them uniformly. That makes it hard to plant the crop correctly, reduces
the crop stand, and cuts yields.
Why farmers may be cautious about conservation agriculture
Farmers are often cautious about giving up ploughing. This is what they have learned
from their parents and grandparents. They know how to grow crops using conventional
methods, and are sceptical about trying new ideas. Most do not have the money available
to try out something new. They fear that the new approach will put their food supply and
families at risk.
Farmers grow the crops the way they do for a reason. Generations of farmers have found
by trial and error whether something works. This indigenous knowledge has enormous
value as a basis for development.
Conservation agriculture will succeed best (a) where farmers recognize a problem with
what they currently do, (b) they adopt conservation agriculture gradually, and (c) adapt it as
they go, using their own skills – and the skills of extension agents.
See Chapter 12 for more on beliefs.

34
Conservation Agriculture
It can be difficult to learn how to cope with weeds. If you don’t control
them properly, your workload may actually increase, or weeds may in-
vade your field and you risk losing part of the harvest.
The solution?
Don’t try to do too much too fast! So if you make a mistake, it won’t matter
too much.
Look for advice. Some of your neighbours may have learned how to solve a
problem already and can tell you about it! Share your experiences with
others.
Learn by doing. Eventually, you will become a seasoned conservation agri-
culture user, and you will know more than anyone else how to make it
work for you, under your own conditions.
Getting support
Another problem is finding the quality support and serv-
ices you need. Many pioneers face this situation. For example:
If no-till planters or rippers are not yet available commercially, you might
have to rely on equipment that arrives too late.
You cannot find the herbicides you need in local farm supply store.
The extension agent may not know much about conservation agriculture,
or about your specific conditions. His advice may actually be misleading.
There are no real solutions to this in the short term. As a pioneer, you will have
to rely more on yourself than on the government services. You can help organ-
ize your neighbours to compensate for the lack of services. If you are well
organized, it is easier to negotiate with development projects, the government
and the private sector for the support you need.
See Chapters 10 and 13 for more on these and other questions.
Saving labour in northern Tanzania
Like many other places in Africa, Karatu District in Tanzania experiences labour short-
ages during parts of the year. Many people are ill from AIDS or malaria, so cannot work.
And many young people go off to work in the cities. There are not enough people left to do
the farm work.
Conservation agriculture can help. It eliminates the heavy work of ploughing. Using her-
bicides and cover crops means less time is needed for the backbreaking task of weed-
ing.
Farmers in Karatu were able to cut their labour needs by as much as three-quarters by
practising conservation agriculture. For sowing, they used jab planters or animal-drawn
no-till planters. They slashed weeds by hand or crushed them with a knife-roller, as well
as spraying herbicide.

Field preparation
and planting

36
Conservation Agriculture
C
ONVENTIONAL TILLAGE – with hand hoes, discs or mouldboard ploughs – dam
ages the soil structure and leaves it exposed to the wind and rain. Farmers
plough the soil for various reasons: to prepare a bed where seeds can germi-
nate easily, to loosen and aerate the soil, to incorporate fertilizer, and to con-
trol weeds. But tilling at the same depth season after season creates a hardpan
in the soil. Erosion results, even on moderate slopes. Tillage also cuts the amount
of organic matter in the soil, so reducing soil fertility and crop yields.
Tillage has an impact way beyond the farm. Eroded soil pollutes rivers and is
deposited as sediment behind dams. Tillage also releases carbon dioxide (CO2)
into the atmosphere, adding to climate change and global warming.
Conservation agriculture avoids these problems. It reduces the amount of till-
age, and can even eliminate it altogether when seeds are planted directly into
the soil. It maintains a cover of vegetation or mulch on the surface. It raises the
organic matter content of the soil, improving fertility and reducing the amount
of CO2 that is produced. It protects the soil from erosion, so helps keep rivers
free of silt.
This chapter describes how to prepare your field and plant crops when using
conservation agriculture. It shows how to do conservation agriculture with
the simplest equipment (a hoe and a piece of string), as well as with animal-
drawn equipment or with a tractor.
The chapter first describes how to remove problems such as compacted
soil, hardpans and ridges and furrows before you start using conserva-
tion agriculture.
It then describes several ways of preparing the field for planting: using
planting basins, planting spots, and ripping.
It goes on to describe various ways to plant seeds: using planting basins, a
planting stick, a jab-planter, and animal- and tractor-drawn planters.
Finally, the chapter describes how to make sure you are using the right
amount of seed and fertilizer.
Before starting conservation
agriculture
Before you start with conservation agriculture, you may have to deal with
various types of soil problems. Three of the most common problems are:
Compacted soils
Hardpans
Ridges and furrows.
The next few pages tell you how to deal with each of these problems.

37
3 Field Preparation and Planting
You may also want to combine conservation agriculture with other techniques,
such as terraces and water-harvesting methods. For example, if soil erosion is
a serious problem in your field, you should deal with it before starting conser-
vation agriculture. See Chapter 8 for some ideas on how to do this.
Compacted soils
Compacted soils have a hard, dense layer at or near the surface. It is difficult
for water to move through this layer, and for seedlings to grow in it.
Soils may be compacted when tillage destroys the soil structure by breaking
down the natural system of pores and channels. The soil can then be com-
pacted more easily by heavy rainfall, animals’ hooves, and wheels of tractors
and carts.
Heavy rainfall on a tilled soil compacts the surface and may form a crust.
This crust can prevent seedlings from growing and reduces infiltration by
rainwater. The water then runs off, causing erosion.
Animals’ hooves compact the top 5 cm of the soil.
Tractor wheels compact the soil at a depth of 10–15 cm.
All soils may become compacted. Sandy soils can be compacted over time be-
cause they do not swell and shrink like clay soils. But the problem is more
serious in clay soils if they are compacted when wet.
Compacted soils make it hard for crop roots to grow and to reach water and
nutrients. They prevent water and air from moving into the soil. This can lower
yields and make crops more susceptible to drought. If the soil is compacted, it
is harder to till.
If your soil is compacted, you should loosen it before starting with conserva-
tion agriculture. See below for how to do this.
Mulch protects the soil surface from heavy rain and stops a crust from form-
ing. It also helps reduce compaction by animals and equipment. By not plough-
ing, the pores and channels made by roots, earthworms and other soil life are
preserved. They let water and air move into the soil – which is good for crops.
Hardpans
A hardpan is a dense layer in the soil that is difficult for water and roots to
penetrate. Hardpans can form in two main ways:
If the soil is ploughed or hoed at the same depth season after season.
If the soil is clayey, hardpans can form naturally without any ploughing.
Hardpans prevent water from moving downwards in the soil. The water is
trapped above the hardpan, resulting in waterlogging. This may damage or
kill the crop.

38
Conservation Agriculture
Hardpans also prevent roots from growing downwards. The roots may be
shorter than usual or bent sideways. They cannot reach nutrients and water
deep in the soil, so the crop may be starved of food and may dry out quickly in
a drought.
If your soil has a hardpan, you should break it in order to get good yields. See
below for how to do this.
How to tell if a soil has a hardpan
Check for the following signs.
Stunted, uneven crops Crops may grow poorly because their roots can-
not reach down to nutrients in the soil.
Yellow leaves Yellow leaves and other signs of nutrient deficiencies (pur-
ple leaves, stunting, brown leaf edges, etc.) may be caused by poor rooting
systems.
Rapid wilting Crops may wilt quickly during dry periods as the surface
layers of the soil dry out.
Distorted roots Dig up plants and look at their roots. If they grow side-
ways at a certain depth, there is probably a hardpan (see Photo 18).
Waterlogging
Puddles on the surface after heavy rains mean that water
cannot drain down into the soil easily – perhaps because of a hardpan.
To check if a soil has a hardpan, use a hoe or spade to dig a small pit about 30
cm (1 foot) deep. You should be able to tell the depth where it becomes much
Roots deformed by a hardpan (left). The roots cannot reach water and nutrients in the soil
beneath the hardpan. The crop is stunted, and wilts easily. Breaking the hardpan (right)
enables water and roots to reach down deeper into the soil.

39
3 Field Preparation and Planting
harder to dig. If you find it difficult to dig, roots will probably find it hard to
grow downwards too. Push a knife blade into the side of the pit at various
depths. A hardpan will make it difficult to push the knife in and pull it out
again.
Treating compacted soils and hardpans
Loosening the soil and breaking the hardpan allow crop roots to penetrate
deeper into the soil and reach more nutrients and water.
There are four main ways to loosen the soil and break up a hardpan:
Using a ripper
Using a subsoiler
Using planting basins
Sowing a strong-rooted cover crop.
If your soil has a hardpan, make sure you break it up when you first switch to
conservation agriculture. If you do not, then your crops will not grow well.
You may have to deal with it again in the near future. That can be expensive
and take a lot of time.
Ripping
If the soil is fairly light, and if the compaction or hardpan is near the surface,
you can use a ripper to loosen the soil.
A ripper is a chisel-shaped implement pulled by animals or a tractor. It breaks
up surface crusts and opens a narrow slot or furrow in the soil, about 5–10 cm
deep. Unlike a mouldboard plough, a ripper does not turn the soil over. You
can rip the soil during the dry season, or at planting time. If you rip at planting
time, you can sow seeds in the slot by hand, or using a planter attached to the
ripper.
See page 47 for more information on ripping.
Do’s and don’ts when ripping and subsoiling
Use the subsoiler when the ground is dry to crack and shatter the hardpan.
Follow the contours when subsoiling or ripping. This encourages water to infiltrate
into the soil rather than running off.
Always dig a soil pit to see whether there is a hard pan, and how deep it is. Then work
with the subsoiler to slightly below this depth.
Don’t use the subsoiler when the soil is wet

Subsoiling
If the hardpan is deeper or if the soil is
heavy, you may have to use a subsoiler.
A subsoiler is a chisel-shaped imple-
ment that looks like a ripper but works
at a greater depth and has narrower
tines, up to 20 cm long. It is designed
to work at a depth of about 20–30 cm,
just below the level of the hardpan. It
breaks the hardpan and allows water
to infiltrate easily into the soil.
You may need at least four strong oxen
to pull a subsoiler. Subsoilers can also
be mounted on a tractor. Subsoiling
deep hardpans in heavy clay soils gen-
erally needs a tractor.
You do not have to subsoil every sea-
son! You may have to do it only once,
when you first switch to conservation
agriculture. It may be necessary to do
it again periodically, once every few
years. Consider hiring someone to do
it for you rather than buying the
equipment and doing it yourself.
Planting basins
If you do not have draught animals or
a tractor, and cannot hire them, then you may have to use a hoe to loosen the
soil and break up a hardpan. The easiest way to do this is to use planting
basins. Instead of hoeing the whole field, you dig basins only where you want
to plant the crops. Dig the basins slightly deeper than the depth to which you
normally hoe, so they break through the hardpan.
See the next page for more on planting basins.
Strong-rooted cover crops
Some cover crops have strong roots that can help break up hardpans, espe-
cially if they are not yet too hard. These cover crops can be planted after rip-
ping, subsoiling or digging planting basins.
Some examples of strong-rooted cover crops:
Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan)
Sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea)
Radish (Raphanus spp.).
Subsoiling again?
You may need to subsoil or rip your field
every few years if you find your soil be-
comes compact or a hardpan reforms.
That may happen on certain soil types, if
you cannot prevent animals from graz-
ing your field, or if you cannot keep the
soil covered all the time.
This subsoiler fits on to a standard plough
beam (like the ripper shown on page 48)

3 Field Preparation and Planting
Plant these crops as cover crops or in rotation with your main crop to break
up a hardpan.
Removing ridges and furrows
If you plan to use a wheeled direct planter, you should try to remove ridges,
bumps and furrows from the field before starting conservation agriculture.
This is because the planter’s drive wheel controls when the seeds are planted.
If the wheel hits a bump, it may sow too many seeds, or not enough. That will
produce an uneven crop stand. Some types of sprayers may also not work
well on uneven ground.
You can get rid of ridges and furrows by ploughing once, before you start
conservation agriculture.
You may want to preserve ridges and furrows if you irrigate your crops, of if
you use them to conserve water or control soil erosion. Remember, though,
that they will make it difficult for you to use a wheeled planter.
Other structures, such as terraces and bunds, can help control erosion on slopes.
Usually these structures are very useful – so keep them! See Chapter 8 for
more on soil conservation.
Planting basins
You do not need a tractor, draught animals or
special equipment to practise conservation ag-
riculture. You don’t need money. You can do it
using just a hoe and a piece of string.
Using planting basins can work under almost
all conditions in Africa. You can do it simply
and easily, and you can adapt it to suit your
own circumstances (see Photos 1 and 2).
Planting basins are small pits in the ground used
for planting many types of crops. They are about
15 cm wide, 30–35 cm long, and 15 cm deep – about the size of a man’s foot.
They are best suited to areas with about 1000 mm of rain a year.
You can dig the planting basins at any time during the dry season, so they are
ready for planting at the beginning of the rainy season.
Here are the basic principles. Adapt them to suit your own situation.
You do not need special
equipment to start using
conservation agriculture.
All you need is a hoe
and a piece of string!

42
Conservation Agriculture
Equipment
You will need the following tools:
A hoe or chaka hoe (a type found
in Zambia and Zimbabwe). It
should be as narrow as possible (10
cm wide is good size).
A long string (called a “teren rope”
in Zambia). This is used to meas-
ure off the correct distance between
the basins. Tie knots in the string
at the plant spacing you want. (In Zambia, for example, farmers space
their maize plants about 70 cm apart.) Instead of tying knots, you can clamp
bottletops to the string at the correct intervals with pliers. Clamp them
tightly so that they will not slip.
Two sticks to mark the rows and to make sure the rows are parallel.
Two strong pegs to hold the string at both ends.
Fertilizer cups to apply fertilizer or lime.
An empty drink can to apply manure.
How to make the basins
1
Stretch the rope across the field, at right angles to the slope, and fix both
ends in place using the two pegs. Keep the string well clear of the ground
so that it stays straight despite any vegetation. The knots or bottletops mark
where to dig each basin. They act as guides for accurate spacing, since you
will use the same basins again and again in the following seasons.
2
Starting at the first knot or bottletop at one end of the string, dig a rectan-
gular basin about 15 cm wide and 30–35 cm long (about the size of a man’s
foot). The basin should be about 15 cm deep (about as deep as your hand).
If there is a hardpan, make sure you dig deep enough to break through it.

At the next knot or bottletop, dig another basin the same size. Work back-
wards along the string so you do not tread on the basins you have already
dug.
4
When you reach the end of the row, use the sticks to measure the distance
to the next row. Move the pegs and stretch out the string again between
them. Stagger the holes so they are not directly next to the holes in the
previous row. This will help catch more rainwater and stops it from run-
ning away downslope.
Applying fertilizer, manure and lime
If you have dug the basins properly and spaced them correctly, you can apply
fertilizer, manure and lime very precisely to avoids wastage. Do this when you
plant, or about 2 weeks before (doing it beforehand speeds up planting).
Manure
Put 1–2 drink cans of manure in each basin. This amounts to 3–
4 tons of manure per hectare.
Compound fertilizer
Put a small container (8 g) of compound fertilizer
in each basin.
Lime
If your soil is acidic, put in two containers of lime as well.
After you have applied manure, fertilizer or lime, use a hoe to partially fill the
basins with soil. Leave the surface about 5 cm (2 inches) lower than the origi-
nal ground level so water will tend to collect in the basin.
You can also apply compound fertilizer at planting time instead of 2 weeks
beforehand.

Urea
Apply 2 containers of urea per basin. The best time to apply urea
depends on the crop. For maize, apply it as a top dressing when the maize
is knee high (make sure the soil is moist when you apply it).
Planting
Deciding when to plant is one of the most important decisions a farmer has to
make. The main aim is to make sure the seeds germinate quickly and evenly.
Some guidelines:
Plant seeds during heavy rain, or within 48 hours after it stops.
Plant only if there is enough moisture for the seeds to germinate evenly.
Mulching will improve the moisture level in the soil where you put the
seed.
Plant at the right depth for your crop. This
helps the seeds to germinate and emerge
evenly.
Try to finish planting a field in one day.
How many basins, how many seeds?
The key is to know how many plants you need per hectare. Here are 2 exam-
ples:
In Lesotho, farmers aim for about 35,000 maize plants per hectare. They
do not dig 35,000 basins! Instead, they dig about 17,500 basins at a spacing
of 75 x 75 cm. They put 3 maize seeds in each basin. They then thin the
plants back to an average of 2 per basin.
In Zambia, farmers aim for 47,000 maize plants per hectare. Their spacing
of 90 x 70 cm gives them about 15,500 basins per hectare. They put 4 seeds
in each basin, then thin them back to an average of 3 per basin.

Do’s and don’ts when using planting basins
Remember that the basins are permanent, and you will come back to plant the same
place next season, and the season after that. So take care the first time.
Train the whole family to make the basins. Everyone in the family should understand
the ideas of conservation agriculture. If they understand why and how, they can help
do it.
Don’t plant in a basin which is not nearly filled with soil – the crops will drown!
Don’t dig basins during the rainy season. Hardpans are best dealt with in the dry
season.

46
Conservation Agriculture
Advantages
It is easy to make and use planting basins. Elderly people, children and
disabled people can all use them to grow the food they need.
The required equipment (a hoe, string, bottle caps, drink cans) is readily
available.
You can dig the basins in advance, perhaps immediately after the harvest.
This spreads the labour needs over a long period and means that planting
can be done early – it is not necessary to wait for the soil to be ploughed
before sowing the seed.
Using basins makes it possible to plant early. They make weeding and ap-
plying fertilizer easier and quicker.
Marking out the correct spacing of basins and rows gives the best plant
population. Planting basins give better yields than conventional plough-
ing, and almost as good as rip planting (see the box above).
Basins allow you to use the right amounts of seed and fertilizer, at the
correct time. This avoids waste and saves money.
You can use the same basins year after year. Plant a different crop in the
same basins next season. The soil fertility in the basins builds up, guaran-
teeing a good yield.
Higher yields from basins
In an experiment in Zambia, planting basins and ripping gave more than twice the yield of
conventional tillage. Over 100,000 farmers in Zambia use basins to plant their crops.

3 Field Preparation and Planting
Disadvantages
Making the basins takes time, especially in the first year. It is a lot more
work if the soil is compacted. That may make it difficult if the family has
limited labour or if some of the family members are ill.
There may be lot of weeds in the field. It is important to deal with them
promptly (see Chapter 7).
Planting spots
If you do not have the time to dig planting basins, you can just scrape out
shallow planting holes in the unploughed soil. Sow the seed in the holes, then
cover them over. This approach is common throughout the Sahel (Mali, Niger,
Chad, and other countries). The only equipment needed is the hand hoe and a
planting stick. You can plant in the dry or just after the rains.
1 Dig small shallow holes at the correct distance from each other. Make the
holes just deep enough to plant the seeds.
2 Put the correct number of seeds in the hole, and cover them with soil.
3 About 2 weeks after the crop emerges, use a stick to make a hole about 10
cm away from each plant. Put fertilizer into the hole.
Advantages
Planting spots require less labour than planting basins or conventional cul-
tivation. That makes them an attractive option for vulnerable households.
Planting can be done on time: there is no need to wait until the soil is
ploughed.
Planting spots do not require expensive equipment – just a hoe and a stick.
Disadvantages
It may be difficult to control weeds.
Planting spots do not break a hardpan caused by hoeing at the same depth
year after year. Crop roots may not grow as well as with planting basins,
and less water will infiltrate into the soil.
Ripping and planting
Ripping opens a narrow slot or furrow in the soil surface, about 5–10 cm deep.
It is often used to break up a surface crust or a shallow hardpan, especially on
lighter soils (see page 39). It can also be used to open a furrow for sowing seeds
– either by hand or using a mechanical planter attached to the ripper itself.

48
Conservation Agriculture
Using the ripper allows you to sow the crop earlier and faster than if you
plough the soil and then plant.
If used for planting, ripped lines are usually spaced about 75 cm apart. The
ground in between the rows is left undisturbed, except for controlling weeds.
Rainwater concentrates in the planting lines and sinks into the soil where the
crop roots are growing.
Equipment
You will need the following:
A ripper There are many variations on the basic chisel-point design, and
rippers vary depending how they are made. Animal-drawn rippers made
by local blacksmiths are popular in eastern Africa.
Ripper with planter attachment
As the ripper-planter’s wheels turn, they drive the delivery of seed and fertilizer. If the
wheels skid, or if they hit a bump, the planter will apply too little seed and fertilizer (or too
much). That is why it is important to remove any ridges and furrows from the field before
starting conservation agriculture. Some makes of planter have wheels with strakes
(spikes) to prevent skidding.
One commercially available version (the Magoye ripper) consists of a ripper that fits on a
standard mouldboard plough beam. It also has a mechanism to sow seed, known as the
Palabana ripper-planter.
Animal-drawn ripper with planter attachment. Inset: The Magoye ripper body with wings to
make ridges. This body can be replaced by a narrower subsoiler to break up a hardpan
(see the drawing on page 40).

49
3 Field Preparation and Planting
Draught animals or a tractor Ripping takes a lot of power (though not as
much as ploughing), so you may need two strong oxen. You may be able to
use donkeys to pull the ripper if the soil is light, if the ripper has a narrow
blade, and if the ripping depth is shallow. On heavy soils or for deep rip-
ping, you may need a tractor.
A planting tool Some rippers have a planter attachment that can do both
ripping and planting in a single pass. The attachment sows the seed (and
perhaps applies fertilizer), then covers it over (see Photos 7–14 and the
drawing on the previous page). If you do not have a ripper-planter, you
can sow seeds in the ripped furrow by hand, or using a machete or plant-
ing stick.
How to do ripping and planting
It is best to do ripping when the soil is dry. That avoids compacting the soil
further, and ensures that the hardpan is broken.
If the field has a cover crop, slash it (or use a herbicide to kill it). When it has
dried out, you can use a ripper though the mulch. The mulch protects the soil
surface from heavy rain and prevents weeds from growing.
If your field is on a slope, rip along the contour (at right angles to the slope).
This will help control erosion.
Heavy clay soils will be difficult to rip when they are dry. If you are using
draught oxen, feed them well beforehand so they are strong enough to pull the
ripper easily. You may have to rip the field twice to make sure the soil is loos-
ened enough. If you use four animals, you may need to make only one pass.
Ripping heavy clay soils will produce large clods, especially if the soil has been
compacted. It is a good idea to leave these soils until the first rains have mois-
tened them a little before ripping them. You can plant seeds at the same time.
If clods are formed, someone should follow behind to make sure the seeds are
well covered.
How far apart to space the ripped slots? This depends on the optimum row
width for the crop you want to plant; about 75 cm is a common distance.
Animals are generally trained to follow the previous furrow, so the row width
will be determined by the length of the yoke between the animals. See Photo
10 and page 58 for how to adjust this.
As soon as you have ripped the soil, you can sow seeds in the ripped opening.
You can use any suitable method: by hand, using a planting stick or machete,
or with a planter attached to the ripper. Cover the seed after sowing so it is not
eaten by birds or animals.
You can rip along the same lines season after season. If possible, plant a differ-
ent crop in the row in the next season to rotate the crops.

50
Conservation Agriculture
Tractor ripping
Medium- and large-farmers often use tractors to rip the soil. Some small-scale
farmers hire a tractor to rip their fields.
Tractor ripping is faster than with draught animals, but it needs a larger area
to be profitable. Tractor ripping produces better results in heavy soils. Some
tractor-rippers also have a planter attachment.
Advantages
Ripping attachments that fit on a normal plough beam are cheaper than
complete implements.
Rippers can be used to make planting slots in dry soil. This allows you to
plant early and gives you a head start for other field operations.
Ripping disturbs the soil less than ploughing. It reduces soil erosion and
encourages water infiltration into the soil.
Disadvantages
Ripping needs strong draught animals or a tractor.
Ripping is difficult if there is a lot of residue on the surface, because the
residue wraps around the ripper shaft. You may have to clear it away from
the lines to be ripped, or cut it into pieces to stop it from tangling around
the ripper.
Ripping disturbs quite a lot of the soil surface: up to 30%.
It may be difficult to control weeds between the rip lines. You may need to
use hoes or herbicide to get rid of weeds.

3 Field Preparation and Planting
Controlling weeds and the cover crop
before planting
Conservation agriculture tries to keep the soil covered with a cover crop or
with crop residues. Before you plant, you may have to kill the cover crop,
along with any weeds. If you do not, they will smother your crop before it has
had a chance to grow.
You can do this in many different ways:
Hand-pull weeds or use a hoe to kill them.
Slash weeds and the cover crop with a machete or billhook.
Use an animal- or tractor-drawn knife roller.
Apply herbicides with a wiper or sprayer.
See Chapter 8 for how to use these different methods.
Planting methods
You can plant seed in various ways:
By hand in planting basins.
Using a dibble stick or machete.
Using a jab-planter.
Using an animal-drawn planter.
Using a tractor-drawn planter.
Horticulture
You can use conservation agriculture to grow vegetables. Many vegetable crops grow well
without tillage.
Root crops (such as carrots)
Use a pick to break the soil and make a hole so the
root can grow down. Put in the seed and cover it with soil.
Tomatoes
These grow very well under conservation agriculture. Make a hole in the
soil and put compost or manure in it. Cover the compost with a little soil, and plant
your seedling in the hole.
Potatoes
Spread a lot of manure on the area to be planted (say, 5 m x 5 m). Place
your potato seed at 30 cm intervals on top. Cover the seed with a thick layer of mulch
(up to knee height). The plant and tubers will be able to grow well.
Try to apply the principles of minimum soil disturbance, soil cover and rotation in your
garden. Try growing other vegetables on a small scale. Do not be afraid to make mis-
takes: you will quickly learn what works.

52
Conservation Agriculture
Reduced tillage for tef
Tef, a major grain crop in Ethiopia, has very small seeds. It cannot be planted in rip lines
because the tiny seeds do not come into enough contact with the soil. Farmers often
plough as many as five times in a crisscross pattern to produce a very fine seedbed. This
repeated tillage encourages erosion.
One alternative is to rip the field once, in rows 75 cm apart, before the rains. This allows
water to infiltrate into the soil easily. Subsoiling along the ripped lines is used to break a
hardpan. On heavy black soils, subsoiling is not needed because deep cracks form on
these soils in the dry season, breaking the hardpan.
The farmers then plough just once, 2–3 weeks before planting, using a maresha plough
modified to turn the soil to one side only. They can then plant tef seeds using a sweep: an
implement like a winged cultivator or a blade harrow that operates at a depth of 5 cm.
More information: Melesse Temesgen
All these methods disturb the soil as little as possible, and help maintain a
permanent soil cover (two of the three principles of conservation agriculture).
No-till planters are designed to plant seed in the soil through the surface mulch.
This makes them different from conventional planters, which are designed to
work in tilled soil without surface residues.
Hand-planting in basins
If you are using planting basins, plant seeds in the basins, add fertilizer, then
cover with soil. See page 41 for more information.
Using a dibble stick or
machete
You can use a planting stick or ma-
chete to make holes to plant the seed.
Cut a hardwood stick from the bush,
sharpen the point, and use it to make
planting holes. Make the holes in lines
at evenly spaced intervals. That makes
it easier to weed and apply fertilizer
or manure.
Adding a sharpened steel tip to the
planting stick makes it last longer and
easier to use. Such sticks are often
available from the village blacksmith.
A simple planting stick is all you need to
direct-plant your crops

53
3 Field Preparation and Planting
If you are planting into ripped lines, you may need a machete to open a hole
for the seed and to cover it over again with soil.
Using a jab-planter
A jab-planter makes planting seed
easier and quicker. A jab planter is a
simple device that is operated by hand.
It has two shafts made of metal or
wood, with handles at the top and a
steel beak at the bottom. A hopper on
one of the shafts holds the seed (Pho-
tos 4–6).
Using a jab-planter is easy, but does
require practice:
1
Hold the handles apart. This opens
a slide and allows a seed to fall into
the closed beak.
2
Jab downwards so the beak pushes
into the soil.
3
Push the handles together. This
opens the beak, so the seed falls
into the hole you have made.
4
Keeping the handles together, lift
the jab-planter out of the soil. The
soil will fall back into the hole, cov-
ering the seed.
Some jab-planters have two hoppers,
one for seed and one for fertilizer. You
can control the number of seeds and
the amount of fertilizer that is applied
by moving a slide at the bottom of the
hoppers.
Make sure you plant at the correct spacing for your crop. As a guide, a man’s
normal stride is about 60 cm long. If you want to plant at a spacing of 70 cm,
you will have to take a long stride between “jabs”. Test yourself with a meas-
ure until you can judge the right distance.
You can keep in a straight line by sighting on a tree or hill in the distance, and
head towards it while planting. You can keep the right distance between rows
by checking the marks you made in the previous row.

Conservation Agriculture
Using an animal-drawn planter
Animal-drawn planters open up a narrow slot in the soil, plant the seed, then
cover the seed over with soil. There are several types.
Hand-operated planters
With the simpler, cheaper types such as those designed by Triple W Engi-
neering (Photos 7–8), the operator drops seed down a tube into the slot cut by
the ripper. Wings on the ripper cover the seed with soil. The operator must
drop the seed down the tube at the right rate in order to get required seed
spacing and plant population. Again, this takes practice.
The planter can plant any type or size of seed without adjustments. These
planters can be made locally using inexpensive raw materials, such as used
car springs. The planter equipment can be taken off the frame and replaced by
other tools, such as a weeder.
Automatic planters
More sophisticated models have a seed hopper and metering system that sows
the right number of seeds automatically, and perhaps a second hopper for
fertilizer. Some planters can be attached to a ripper (see page 49).
The Fitarelli No. 12 planter, for example, is attached to a yoke pulled by draught
oxen. A disk cuts through vegetation and mulch on the surface, and a chisel
point opens a furrow for the seed and fertilizer. The rear wheel drives a mecha-
nism that drops seeds and fertilizer through tubes just behind the chisel. The
rear wheel then covers the seed with soil. The operator can correct the seed
spacing in the row by adjusting the gears on the wheel.
Other planters (e.g., Knapik, IADEL and Triton: see Photos 13–14) are at-
tached to a chain that is pulled by draught animals. Like the Fitarelli machine,
they have a vertical disc to cut through
mulch, and a chisel point or a pair of
inclined discs to open a furrow. They
have hoppers for seed and fertilizer,
and a mechanism to control how much
of each is applied.
Semi-automatic planters
One problem with automatic planters
is that their wheels may sometimes
skid, especially on stony or muddy
ground. The wheels control the release
of seed and fertilizer, so leave un-
planted gaps if they do not turn.

the Ethiopian Agricultural Research
Organization. More information: Melesse

3 Field Preparation and Planting
Equipment suppliers
African farmers can choose from several
makes of animal-drawn planters and
fertilizer applicators. See Chapter 14 for
a list of manufacturers and suppliers.
A semi-automatic row planter, devel-
oped by the Ethiopian Agricultural
Research Organization, avoids this
problem. The operator moves a han-
dle back and forth to release seeds and
fertilizer. The planter has no wheels,
so can be used in fields where other
planters would be hard to manage.
Tractor-mounted planters
Tractor-mounted planters can plant and fertilize several rows at a time. They
have several hoppers for seed and fertilizer (typically 3–6 for small and me-
dium tractors), mounted side-by-side (Photo 12). They work in a similar way
to the animal-drawn equipment described above, but are faster and more ac-
curate – and of course, more expensive.
It is possible to use a hand-tractor to pull a ripper or planter. Such tractors
may be useful if draught animals are scarce – for example if there is not enough
fodder in the dry season to feed livestock.
Using the right amount of seed and
fertilizer
When using equipment that plants seed or applies fertilizer, it is important to
make sure that the right amount is being applied. If you do not, you will end
up with the wrong plant spacing, plant population and fertilizer dosage. You
risk getting lower yields and wasting money.
Working out how many kilograms of seed you need
You want to know how many kilograms of seed you will need to plant your
field. You will need to know how big your field is, and what the recommended
seeding rate per hectare is.
1
Borrow some scales (from a shopkeeper?) and weigh out 10 grams of the
seeds. Then count the number of seeds you have weighed.

Work out how many kilograms of seeds you need for your field:

Adjusting a jab planter
You have to adjust the settings of a jab planter so it delivers the right amount
of each. There is a slide at the base of the hoppers that determines the amount
of seed and fertilizer that drop through when you pull the planter handles
apart. How many seeds drop through depends on how big the seeds are.
Move the slide until the right number of seeds crop through – for example, two
or three maize seeds each time. Check this by opening and closing the handles
10–20 times, then counting the number of seeds that drop.
You can open and close the jab planter over someone’s hands to show how
much seed and fertilizer it delivers.
Calculating the planting distance and plant population
for a jab planter or planting stick
If you know the number of plants you want per hectare, you can use this
equation to calculate the planting distance within the row:
Example
You count the number of seeds in 10 grams, and find there are 23 seeds.
The recommended seeding rate for this crop is 50,000 per hectare.

Calculating the amount of fertilizer to apply with a jab
planter or planting stick
How much fertilizer should you apply in each hole? You need to know the
planting distance within the rows, the distance between the rows, and the
fertilizer recommendation per hectare. You can then use this equation:

If you are using a jab planter with a fertilizer hopper, fill the hopper, adjust
the fertilizer delivery slide, then open and close the jab planter until a constant
amount of fertilizer falls to the ground. Open and close the jab planter 20
times, then weigh the fertilizer that has fallen through. If it is more (or less)
than 20 times the amount you need, close (or open) the slide a little and test it
again.
Adjusting the distance between rows with an animal-
drawn planter
If you are using draught animals, how can you make sure your planting rows
are spaced the right distance apart?
Draught animals are trained to follow the previous furrow or planting line. So
the distance between the rows will be half the distance between the animals –
which is determined by the length of the yoke (crosspiece) between them.
For a row spacing of 75 cm, the animals must be 150 cm apart. Use a yoke a
little longer than this so it is long enough to harness the animals to it.
Adjusting an animal-drawn planter
You can adjust the number of seeds that a planter delivers in different ways.
How to make this adjustment depends on the particular planter you are using.
Here is how to work out the planting distance and number of seeds per hec-
tare for planters that use a wheel to control the seeding.
1
Make sure you are using the right seed plate for your seed. Seed plates are
designed for graded seed. If your seed is ungraded (if the seeds are differ-
ent sizes), you will get different numbers of seeds in each planting hole.
Choose a plate that gives you the best number on average for your needs.
2
Mark one point on the drive wheel (the wheel that runs the seed and ferti-
lizer feed). Put the planter in the gear you will use, then pull it in a line
along the ground, counting how many times the drive wheel turns. Pull it
Example
You want to apply 100 kg of fertilizer per hectare. Your planting distance is 0.75 x 0.5 m.
How much fertilizer should you apply in each hole?

until the wheel has gone round 10 times. Now measure the distance you
have pulled it.
3
Now fix a plastic bag over the bottom of the seed spout. Put some seeds in
the hopper and hold the planter up so the drive wheel is clear of the ground.
Without moving the planter, turn the wheel 10 times. Turn the wheel at
the same speed as if animals were pulling the planter.
4
Count the number of seeds that are collected in the plastic bag.
5
You can now work out the planting distance for this seed size and planter
setting:
Distance between seeds (m)
=
(Equation F)
Distance covered in 10 wheel turns (m)
Number of seeds dropped
Example
You pull the planter along and count drive wheel turning 10 times. You measure the
distance, and find you have pulled it 15 m.
When you rotate the drive wheel 10 times, you collect 37 seeds in the plastic bag. What is
the planting distance?
Distance between seeds (m)

=
about 0.4 m

Adjusting the fertilizer rate is different on different planters.
On the Fitarelli No. 12 planter, you can change the star wheels. There
are two of these wheels, one half the width of the other. The smaller
wheel will deliver half the amount of fertilizer. You can use more than

Test the planter on a sandy piece of soil to demonstrate where it places the
seeds. Measure the distance between the seeds to make sure your calcula-
tions are correct.
8
You can adjust the seeding rate by changing the gears or sprockets on the
planter. The settings are different on each machine.
On the Fitarelli planter, slide the gears along the drive shaft until the
one you want is engaged.
On other planters (e.g., Knapik, IADEL, Triton), remove one sprocket
and replace it with a large or smaller one to get the seed rate you want
(Photos 15–16).
Adjusting fertilizer amounts
The best amount of fertilizer depends on the type of fertilizer, the soil and the
crop type. You will have to adjust the planter for each situation.
You can calculate the fertilizer application rate in a similar way to the seeding
rate:
1
Tie a plastic bag over the fertilizer spout, raise the wheel off the ground,
and turn it 10 times. Weigh how much fertilizer is collected in the bag.
2
Calculate the fertilizer delivered per hectare using this equation:
Example
Your planter delivers 70 g of fertilizer when you turn the wheel 10 times. When you pull the
planter so the drive wheel turns 10 times, it travels 15 m.
Your row spacing is 0.75 m. How much fertilizer will you apply per hectare?

one wheel, and you then slide a metal plate along to prevent fertilizer
from leaking.
On the Knapik planter, you can change the drive sprocket to set the
amount of fertilizer delivered. You can fine-tune the amount by adjust-
ing the cover on the fertilizer spout.
On the IADEL planter, you can change the drive sprocket, and raise or
lower the hopper to allow more or less fertilizer to be fed into the deliv-
ery tube.

Keeping the soil
healthy

64
Conservation Agriculture
M
any of Africa’s soils are sick. Yields in many places have fallen over the
last 20 years. Fields that used to produce 20 bags of maize might now
produce less than 10 bags.
Many farmers face crop failure, and their families are hungry. Countries that
used to export maize now depend on food aid.
Conservation agriculture can make these soils healthy again. And if the soils
are healthy, yields will go up. Farmers will be able to feed their families and
have extra to sell.
What makes soils hungry and sick?
Virgin soils under forest, bush or grasslands have a lot of organic matter. This
rich, black material has built up over many years. It is very fertile. When farm-
ers clear the natural vegetation, they at first get very good yields.
But ploughing the land and removing the crop residue leaves the land bare.
The plant nutrients are washed away. The fine particles, clay and valuable
organic matter are eroded first, leaving a poor, hungry soil (Photo 17).
When the soil is turned, the organic matter decomposes quickly. It turns into
lifeless minerals or into carbon dioxide gas, which disappears into the air.
Within 10 years after opening virgin land, more than half the organic matter is
lost.
Which would you prefer?
Three bags of maize from your acre of land.
Or 22 bags?
Farmers in Lesotho harvest just three bags of maize per acre: 375
kg per hectare. They plough their fields with oxen or with tractors.
They plant the same crop year after year. The soils are poor, com-
pacted and eroded. And three bags are all they can harvest.
People are leaving the land because they cannot
make a living.
But if they manage their soil well, the
same farmers can produce 22 bags of
maize per acre – or 4 tons per hectare.
By using conservation agriculture –
avoiding ploughing, keeping the soil
covered, and rotating crops – they can
rebuild their soil fertility. The soil will re-
pay them many times over with higher
yields, year after year.
Of course, not all farmers can get such dra-
matic increases – but some can! Worth a try?

have?
Low crop yields
High levels of inorganic fertilizers
needed to produce a good crop
Crops are short and stunted
Bare soil
Yields vary widely from year to year.
Yields tend to fall year after year
What makes a soil sick?
“Mining agriculture”: farming for
many years, taking away nutrients
without giving any back to the soil
Soil erosion
Loss of organic matter
Loss of soil life
Breakdown of soil structure
Compaction of the soil
Bare soil exposed to the rain and
sun
Organic matter holds onto water and
plant nutrients. Once the organic mat-
ter is gone, the water drains away or
runs off easily. Nutrients are washed
deeper down into the soil, where plant
roots cannot reach them.
Earthworms, termites and other tiny
animals normally make burrows in
the soil and break down the organic
matter into simpler forms that plants
can use. But they cannot live if there
is no organic matter. Without them,
the soil becomes hard and lifeless.
Ploughing destroys the soil structure.
Below the ploughed layer, a hardpan
develops. Crop roots cannot push
through this hard layer, so they can-
not reach water and nutrients beneath
it. The shallow layer above the hard-
pan dries out quickly during dry spells,
so the crops go thirsty too.
The soil has become seriously sick. It
has lost its ability to produce a good
crop.

Keeping the Soil Healthy
What is a healthy soil?
A healthy soil is a living soil.
It has many different animals in it: earthworms, beetles, and many tiny animals that
are so small they cannot be seen with the naked eye.
It is high in organic matter.
It is rich in nutrients that plants can use as food.
It is deep enough for plant roots to grow properly.
It has a mixture of fine (clay) soil particles and coarse particles (sand and silt).
It contains lumps and clumps of different sizes.
The surface does not seal after rain.
Organic matter
A healthy soil has a lot of organic matter.
Organic matter provides a home and food
for earthworms and other beneficial soil or-
ganisms. It binds soil particles together and
improves the soil structure. It helps the soil
hold water. It improves the soil fertility and
leads to higher yields.
A healthy soil is a living soil. It must be full of earthworms and other soil
organisms. These organisms loosen the topsoil better than a hoe or a plough.
They break up dead leaves and stalks, carry it down into the soil, and mix it in.
They speed up the decomposition of organic matter and release of plant nutri-
ents. They compete with harmful organisms that may cause crop diseases.
How fast the organic matter breaks down depends on three things:
Soil organisms: animals (earthworms, beetles, termites, other insects), mi-
croorganisms (bacteria and fungi too small to be seen with the naked eye),
and plants. (If there are many of these organisms, the organic matter will
decompose quickly.)
The physical environment: the soil texture, temperature, moisture and
air. (Organic matter decomposes slowly if the soil is dry, for example.)
Quality of organic matter: Woody stems and waxy leaves break down
slowly.
The soil can lose organic matter in several ways:
It is broken down into minerals and carbon dioxide gas. This happens
quickly if the soil is turned over by ploughing and if it is exposed to the sun
and rain.
Erosion: it is washed away by water, or carried off by wind.
It is carried out of the field as crops or fodder.
Conservation agriculture
aims to keep the soil alive

68
Conservation Agriculture
You can do many things to prevent organic matter from being lost:
Don’t plough or hoe.
Use mulch or a cover crop to protect the soil from sun and rain.
Prevent erosion: plant along the contour, use bunds and microcatchments,
etc.
Don’t take the crop residues out of the field. Leave them on the ground.
Do not allow animals to graze on the field.
You can add to your organic matter bank in several ways:
Leave crop residues in the field.
Plant cover crops.
Bring in mulch from outside.
Add compost and manure.
Making the soil healthy again
Fortunately, it is possible to make a sick soil healthy again. Here are the steps:
1
If your soil has a hardpan, break it with a subsoiler. This allows water to
sink into the soil, and lets crop roots reach nutrients and water deeper in
the soil.
2
Stop ploughing and hoeing the soil. Instead, you can use a hoe to make
planting basins, open planting lines with a ripper, or plant directly using a
jab planter.
3
Do not remove crop residues, and do not allow animals to graze on them.
Leave them on the ground so they protect the soil and add to the organic
matter.
A healthy soil has lots of organic matter, earthworms and other tiny animals in it.

4 Keep rainwater in the field When it runs off, the water carries plant
nutrients and organic matter with it. Build microcatchments or bunds along
the contour to prevent it from running away.
5 Add organic matter and plant nutrients: compost, manure, mulch brought
in from outside the field, and inorganic fertilizer.
6 Plant cover crops to protect your soil and produce more organic matter. If
your soil is compacted, you can loosen it by planting strong-rooted cover
crops such as pigeonpea or sunn hemp (see Chapter 5).
Keeping the soil healthy
It is not enough to apply inorganic fertilizer to keep the soil healthy.
In conventional farming, it is necessary to apply more and more fertilizer to
get the same yield.
Conservation agriculture, on the other hand, produces more yield for the same
amount of fertilizer. It does this because the soil structure is better and there is
more organic matter. Crop roots can go much deeper, and more water can
sink into the soil. There are more living organisms to recycle organic matter
and make plant nutrients available.
Conservation agriculture keeps the soil healthy. Only a healthy soil can pro-
duce a good yield.
Using conservation agriculture can increase number of earthworms and other small animals
in the soil very quickly

How rich is your soil?
Here’s one way to check the organic matter in your soil.
1
Take a handful of soil from a field that has been ploughed for several years. Put it in
a glass of water.
2
Now take a handful of the best soil you can find – a soil full of organic matter. Put it in
another glass of water.

Compare what you see in the two glasses.

Many worms make light work
Earthworms are the farmer’s best friend. They break down organic matter
into simpler materials that plants can use. They mix organic matter into the
soil, and they help bind soil particles together, improving the soil structure.
Their burrows allow water and air to get
into the soil. They also allow roots to pen-
etrate the soil easily.
Organic matter is food for earthworms. If
there is a lot of organic matter, earthworms
can multiply. The more worms, the healthier
the soil.
Important plant nutrients
Plants need many different types of nutrients. The most important are nitro-
gen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) (see the table below).
Let earthworms till the
soil. They do it better
than a plough or hoe.

Organic fertilizers
There are many different types of organic
fertilizers:
Crop residues
Cover crops
Mulch brought in from outside
Animal manure
Compost
Organic fertilizers have two big advantages: they add organic matter to the
soil directly, and they are free! You can grow or make them yourself. If you
have more than you need, you can also sell them to your neighbours.
Unfortunately, most organic fertilizers do not contain much phosphorous.
Plants need this nutrient to grow. You can improve the quality of organic fer-
tilizer by adding plants that are high in phosphorus, or by adding phosphate
fertilizer (see page 75).
Crop residues, cover crops and mulch
Keeping a permanent soil cover is a good way to replenish the organic matter
in the soil. You can use various types of cover:
Crop residues The stalks and leaves of crops are good as mulch. Stover
from maize and sorghum breaks down slowly, so stays on the surface for a
long time and protects the soil. The stalks and leaves of legumes are rich in
nitrogen and break down quickly, so the nutrients can soon be used by the
following crop.
Cover crops Plant these when they fit in your cropping system and al-
low them to grow and cover the soil. Slash them or kill them with herbicide
just before planting the next crop and leave the dead material on the ground
as mulch. Leguminous cover crops are especially valuable because they fix
nitrogen from the air and make it available for other crops.
Grasses and weeds You can cut grasses and weeds from the edges of
the fields or from outside. Spread them on the soil as mulch. Do not bring
in vegetation that contains seeds, as you will spread weeds.
Prunings from shrubs and trees You can trim branches and use them as
mulch. You can harvest the branches at any time during the year. Legumi-
nous trees and shrubs are high in nitrogen.
Some plants decompose quickly, while others break down more slowly.  Try to
use several different types of materials to get the best combination of soil cover
and decomposing vegetation when you need it.
See Chapter 5 for more information on crop residues, cover crops and mulch.

Animal manure
Animal manure makes good-quality fertilizer. Leave it to decompose before
applying it to crops, as it will “burn” the plants if it touches them.
Poultry droppings make the best manure, followed by goat droppings, then
sheep and cattle dung.
Animals fed on good-quality feed produce the best-quality manure.
Compost
You can make compost from leaves, weeds, manure, ash, kitchen waste, and
any other organic material available.
Try to use materials that rot easily, such as grass and leaves. Woody materials
such as tree branches and maize stalks, and shiny leaves such as eucalyptus,
do not make good compost.
You can make compost in a pit (best in areas with low or medium rainfall), or
in a pile (best in high-rainfall areas).
Inorganic fertilizers
There are many different types of inorganic fertilizers. They contain nitrogen
(N), phosphorus (P) or potassium (K), or some combination of these three nu-
trients. They may also contain other nutrients that plants need in smaller
amounts. If you know what nutrient your soil needs, you can choose the right
type of inorganic fertilizer that provides that nutrient (see the table on page
72).

Making compost, Swazi style
There are many ways to make compost. Here is how farmers in Swaziland do it.
1
Choose a shady place under a tree or a thatched roof to protect the compost from the
sun and rain.
2
Push four sticks (1.5 m long) into the ground, one at each corner of where you want to
make your compost pile. Push in a fifth stick in to mark the centre of the pile.
3
Start the pile with a layer of sticks or maize stalks, 30 cm thick. This layer lets air
circulate in the pile.
4
Add a layer of dry grass or other vegetation. Make this layer about 10 cm thick.
5
Add a layer of manure, also about 10 cm thick.
6
Add a layer of dry straw from legumes, also about 10 cm thick.
7
Sprinkle a thin layer of ash on top.
8
Add more layers of grass, other vegetation, manure, straw and ash until the pile is
about 1.5 m high – as tall as the sticks. A well-made compost pile has almost vertical
sides and a flat top.
9
Cover the pile with a layer of topsoil.
10 Water the pile about three times a week. If it has been raining, you do not need to
water it.
11 After 4 weeks, turn the pile over to mix the different layers. Do not add any fresh
materials. Water the pile for another week, then leave it for 6 weeks.
12 After the 6 weeks, the compost is ready for use.
Fortified compost in western Kenya
Some farmers in western Kenya have learned how to make “fortified compost”. They add
a little rock phosphate (about 2–5 kg) to the compost pile, or leaves and stems of the wild
sunflower (Tithonia diversifolia).
Tithonia decomposes very fast. It contains high levels of nitrogen and potassium, and a
reasonable amount of phosphorus (see the table on page 74). It is common in western
Kenya, and is found on roadsides and farm boundaries.
Lantana camara, Vernonia and Acanthus are also good compost fortifiers.
The farmers say that carrying these materials to the compost pile takes some work, and
some are hard to harvest because they are thorny.
Compost in conservation agriculture
“In our farm, we practise conservation agriculture. We intercrop maize and beans. We
introduced a cover crop by planting lablab between the maize and beans rows. Since
lablab forms a big canopy, we plant at a wider spacing. At harvest time, we cut the maize
with a panga, and spread it low to avoid smothering the cover crop.
My brother and I help my parents make improved compost near our homestead. When
the compost is ready, we carry it to the field and spread it evenly without disturbing the soil.
When we plant the crop, we move the crop residue a little to make room for planting.”

Feed your soil
If  you work your oxen day after day,
but feed them nothing, they will die!
If  you keep taking from your soil with-
out feeding it, it will die!
What have you fed your soil lately?
Inorganic fertilizers are much more
concentrated than organic fertilizers.
A bag of inorganic fertilizer may con-
tain as much nitrogen as a tonne of
compost! You need only a small
amount of inorganic fertilizer for
each plant. That makes inorganic fer-
tilizers easy to use.
Inorganic fertilizers do not contain
organic matter themselves. But they
do add organic matter to the soil in
an indirect way: they help crops
grow better, so you will have more
crop residues to leave on the soil at the end of the season. They also replenish
nutrients (especially phosphorus) that compost and other organic fertilizers
have only in small amounts.
Inorganic fertilizer can be expensive and hard to find. If you cannot afford a
whole bag of fertilizer, it may be worth getting together with your neighbours
to buy a bag between you.
What’s in a fertilizer?
Inorganic fertilizers usually contain 3 main elements: nitrogen, phosphorus and potas-
sium. Some have only nitrogen, some have only phosphorus, and some have only potas-
sium.
Some types of inorganic fertilizer have two or all three of these nutrients, and are called
“compound fertilizers”.
Check the label on the fertilizer bag to see what it contains. A bag of diammonium phos-
phate should say something like this:
NPK 18–46–0
This means that 18% of the fertilizer is nitrogen (N), 46% is phosphorus (P), and there is
no potassium (K) (0%).
There are many different combinations of fertilizer. For example:
Urea is 46–0–0 (46% nitrogen, no phosphorus or potassium).
TSP (triple superphosphate) is 0–45-0 (no nitrogen, 45% phosphorus, no potas-
sium).
If possible, get your soil tested to find out what nutrients it needs. Then choose the type of
fertilizer that your soil and crop need.

Keeping the Soil Healthy
Combining inorganic fertilizers and organic manures
Inorganic fertilizers are expensive, and organics are sometimes poor quality
and contain little nitrogen. So it is best to combine inorganic fertilizers with
organic manures – perhaps at half the recommended rates of application. This
combination also improves the fertilizer use efficiency. You can combine the
two types of fertilizers by fortifying compost or by applying them both directly
to the field.
How to apply fertilizer
When you apply both organic and inorganic fertilizers, disturb the soil as little
as possible, and try not to interfere with the soil cover.
Planting basins
Mix the fertilizer with soil before planting. Use bottle
caps or cans to measure the amount of fertilizer you put into each basin.
Ripped lines
Apply the fertilizer into the ripped lines. Apply DAP, TSP
and compound fertilizer in the line before planting. Apply urea as top-
dressing to maize and sorghum plants at the tasselling or flowering stage.
Cover crop and direct planting
Make a hole with a small hoe or planting
stick, and put in the fertilizer by hand. Cover the fertilizer with soil and
Combining inorganic and organic fertilizer
“I used manure and inorganic fertilizer before I learned about conservation agriculture.
But I wasn’t using the right amounts, and I didn’t apply them the right way. I was using low-
quality manure. I spread it over my whole farm and ploughed it in. Then I made planting
holes and put in a very small amount of fertilizer (1 handful of fertilizer for more than 10
holes). I used to get only 5 bags of grain per acre.
I was introduced to conservation agriculture through my farmers group in late 2002. We
trained how to do it on a group farm in 2003.
I started practising conservation agriculture on my own farm in 2003. But I didn’t have
enough materials: I didn’t use any crop residue, and I didn’t have enough fertilizer. I used
the same amounts as I was using before. But I didn’t plough the soil. My maize yield
doubled from 5 to 10 bags.
I was well-prepared this year. I left three-quarters of the maize stover in the field as mulch.
I cut the top quarter to feed my livestock. I also grew lablab as a cover crop in the field. And
I have learned how to make compost to improve the quality of manure.
When I plant maize, I make a row of holes with a hoe. I put a handful of manure and a
teaspoonful of fertilizer in each hole. I mix them and put the seed beside the mixture to
keep the fertilizer from scorching it.
When the maize is knee-high, I top-dress it with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN). I apply
CAN on the surface when the soil is wet, in a circle around the plants.”

Conservation Agriculture
More with less in Brazil
Farmers in Brazil used to have very similar problems to those faced by many African
farmers today: heavy rain washed away their fertilizer and eroded their soil. For every
kilogram of soybeans harvested in Brazil, 10 kg of precious topsoil was lost.
Frank Dijkstra was one of the first farmers to use conservation agriculture in Brazil. He
switched to conservation agriculture in the late 1970s. Twenty years later, his maize yields
had doubled, and his soybean yields had risen by 75%.
More inorganic fertilizer?
No. In fact, less. Frank now uses only half the amount of fertilizer on soybean, and two-
thirds of the amount on his maize.
With conservation agriculture, he produces much more yield, with much lower inputs, and
has stopped erosion.
That’s good for the environment, good for the future, and good for his pocket.
More information: Rolf Derpsch, rderpsch@telesurf.com.py
Precision placement with a string
Farmers working with the IMPALA project (see box on page 110) in western Kenya use a
string to sow seeds and apply fertilizer.
The farmers plant leguminous shrubs as part of their crop rotation. These shrubs provide
enough nitrogen for their maize crop. But the soil is short of phosphorus.
When they plant maize, beans or legumes, the farmers take a long string with a knot every
25 cm. They make a small hole with a panga (large knife) or hoe next to each knot. They
put a pinch of TSP fertilizer (the amount that would fit on the tip of a teaspoon) in the hole,
followed by two seeds. They then cover the hole with their foot.
This precision placement saves seeds, fertilizers and work.

put the seeds on top. Apply urea to the planting stations, for maize at
tasselling, for sorghum at flowering.
Using a jab planter or animal-drawn planter Some planters have two
containers: one for seeds, and one for fertilizer. See page 53 for details.
Converting to conservation agriculture
Switching from ploughing or hoeing to direct planting through a soil cover
will help degraded soil recover. The fertility will go up. Your soil health will
gradually improve from year to year.
But you need to be careful. Many crop residues, especially straw from maize,
sorghum and wheat, are low in nitrogen. When they decay, they make soak
up nitrogen (and maybe phosphorus) from the soil. So you may have to add

79

Keeping the Soil Healthy
extra inorganic fertilizer to make up for this. You should, of course, add nitro-
gen in other ways too: rotate with legumes, plant leguminous cover crops,
leave mulch on the surface, and apply compost or animal manure.
Once the soil is healthy again, you can slowly reduce the amount of fertilizer
you apply. In the long run, conservation agriculture can produce higher yields
than conventional farming, but needs less inorganic fertilizer.
Over time, the amount of organic matter builds up in the soil. Yields increase
steadily over time.

Soil cover

82
Conservation Agriculture
A
PERMANENT YEAR-ROUND soil cover is central to conservation agriculture. It is
important for several reasons:
It protects the soil from rain, sun, and wind.
It reduces soil erosion and protects the fertile topsoil, so preventing the
silting of rivers and lakes.
It stops the soil surface from sealing, and reduces the amount of precious
rainwater that runs off.
It suppresses weeds by smothering their growth and reducing the number
of weed seeds. This reduces the amount of work needed for weeding.
It increases the soil fertility and the organic matter content of the soil.
It increases soil moisture by allowing more water to sink into the ground
and by reducing evaporation.
Decomposing vegetation and the roots of cover crops improve the soil struc-
ture and make the clumps and
lumps in the soil more stable – mak-
ing it harder for rain to break them
up and wash them away.
Earthworms and other forms of life
can prosper in the cover as well as
in the soil.
Soil cover stimulates the develop-
ment of roots, which in turn im-
prove the soil structure, allow more
water to soak into the soil, and re-
duce the amount that runs off.
There are two main types of soil cover:
Living plant material: crops and cover crops.
Mulch, or dead plant material: crop residues and prunings from trees and
shrubs.
You will often use a combination of mulch and living plants to keep the soil
covered.
To obtain a good soil cover, you should leave crop residues such as maize and
sorghum stalks in the field. You might also be able to add mulch from outside
the field: for example, you can cut grass from nearby, or bring in leaves and
prunings from trees and shrubs. They will decompose after a while, so you
will have to replace them regularly.
In addition, you can plant a cover crop, either during the cropping season (to
cover the area in between the crop rows), or afterwards to cover the whole
field. During the cropping season itself, the crops themselves act as soil cover.
An intercrop of tall plants (such as maize) and low-growing plants (such as
beans) makes a good cover.
Like an umbrella
Soil cover protects the soil and micro-
organisms that live in it from the heat
of the sun and the impact of rain. A
good farmer gives her soil an umbrella
to keep it healthy. Only a healthy soil
can produce a good crop.

83
5 Soil Cover
Feed the soil to feed the people
Cover crops are the food of the soil.
Only a healthy soil can provide the nec-
essary food to the people. Soil has life,
which needs to be fed.
Farmer slogan, Swaziland
It can be difficult to keep the soil cov-
ered, especially in semi-arid areas. It
may be necessary to compromise: some
cover is better than none.
Cover crops
Cover crops are planted to provide a
soil cover, improve soil fertility and
produce food and feed. They are nor-
mally grown during the dry season or as intercrops. They may be allowed to
grow throughout the cropping season, or they may be killed and left on the
soil surface as mulch.
Africa has many different cover crops. They fall into four main groups: leg-
umes, shrubs, grasses, and other. The type of cover crop you choose influence
the quantity and quality of mulch it provides. The most common cover crops
in Africa are listed in the table on the next page (see also Photos 21–27).
Some farmers already intercrop maize with beans, where the beans may act as
a cover crop for part of the year.
How to choose the right cover crop
Small-scale farmers prefer a cover crop which fits into their normal cropping
system and which has multiple purposes:
Edible seeds and vegetables
Soil fertility
Animal fodder
Firewood/fencing material
Weed suppression
Medicines.
First, check which cover crops grow well in your area. This depends on the
soil type, rainfall, temperature and altitude. If you live in an area with little
rainfall, select a cover crop that grows quickly, such as cowpea, desmodium,
lablab, lucerne, mucuna, or pigeonpea.
Then check how much work each cover crop will need: for land preparation
before planting, weeding, and producing and harvesting the seeds. Species
with big pods and grains (such as pigeonpea and mucuna) are easier to deal
with than species with small pods (such as vetch and grasses). Most farmers
prefer species that cover the soil quickly and completely, and which can also
be used for food and fodder.

Make sure that the cover crop does not interfere with the main crop. For
example, avoid growing a tall cover crop that might shade the main crop. You
can also prevent the cover crop from interfering with the main crop by plant-
ing it later (see page 92).
If you cannot prevent livestock from getting into your fields, you might want
to choose a cover crop that they do not like to eat, such as jackbean (Canavalia)
or sunn hemp (Crotalaria).
When they die, some cover crops rot quicker than others. Legumes decompose
more quickly than grasses. This means that the next crop can use nutrients
such as nitrogen from the legumes quickly. A mixture of legumes and grasses
is best to ensure a lasting soil cover.
Seed supply
It can be difficult to get hold of good quality seed – especially for cover crops.
You may be able to find seeds from these sources:
Research institutes or the extension service
Ask extension agents or
researchers if they can get seeds for you. Research stations may have a
collection of varieties and be willing to let you have some seed.
Seed dealers and farm supply stores
Good seed companies provide only
certified seed, which has been treated with fungicide and insecticide to
prevent problems in germination and early growth. If the seed seller doesn’t
have any seed in stock, perhaps they can get some from elsewhere. Don’t
be afraid to ask!
Wild sources
Leguminous trees such as calliandra, sesbania or gliricidia
may grow wild in your area, or they may be planted as hedgerows or wind-
breaks. Collect the seed, dry it and store it ready for planting.
Farmer groups
You can organize a group of neighbours to produce seeds
for the group members. You may be able to sell any extra seed to other
farmers.

Conservation Agriculture
Growing your own seed
1
During the growing season, walk through the fields and mark with a piece of cloth or
string good, healthy plants that have the characteristics you want. Be careful! Select
only from pure stands of a single variety, where there is no mixing with other varieties,
and no chance of cross-pollination. Do not collect seed from hybrids, as the result
will usually be very poor.
2
Harvest the marked plants separately, before harvesting the rest of the crop.
3
Dry the seed carefully. Treat it with suitable fungicides and pesticides recommended
in your area. You may be able to use natural insecticides such as neem extracts.
4
Store the seed in a safe place.
5
Dry seeds at regular intervals to prevent them from getting damp.
Cover crops improve the soil
“Since I stopped ploughing and started growing cover crops, the colour of my soil has
changed. It has become much darker, and when I walk across the fields, I feel that the soil
is no longer hard and has become soft.”
Farmer from Karatu, Tanzania
Grow your own
If you already have some cover crops, you can harvest
your own seed and plant it again in the next season. You may be able to sell
surplus seed to neighbours. If there is a lot of demand for seed in your area,
it may be worthwhile to plant a special field with a pure stand of a cover
crop so you can harvest and sell the seed. Ask your extension agent for
training on how to produce good-quality seed.
If you do not know the quality of your seed, you can test it for germination
before planting. Count out a certain number of seeds (e.g., 50 or 100). Plant
them in a container of soil. After the seeds have started to sprout, count how
many germinate. If only a few germinate, you can either increase the amount
of seed you plant, or try to get new seed.
Seed treatment
Inoculation
Legumes are valuable because they fix nitrogen from the air and make it avail-
able for other crops. They do this in nodules (bumps) on their roots that con-
tain special bacteria. Most types of legumes can make nodules by themselves,
but some types may need some help. If you are planting a particular legume
for the first time, you may need to inoculate the seeds first.

91
5
Soil Cover
Inoculation is easy. Here’s how to do it.
1
Sterilize some soil by pouring boiling water on it and letting it cool.
2
Find a good plant (or tree) of the species you want to inoculate (It has to be
the same species, as there are different bacteria for each species of legume.)
Dig to the roots and look for a nodule – a bump on the root. Squeeze it and
check that it is pink inside. Collect several nodules from the plant or tree.
3
Gently crush the nodules and mix them with the sterile soil.
4
Mix your seeds with the soil before planting them. For seedlings, gently rub
the soil over the roots before planting.
For some legumes such as soybeans and some tree species, it is possible to buy
ready-made inoculant from farm supply stores. Make sure you get the right
type of inoculant for the species you want to plant.
Note: In many cases, inoculation is often not necessary (and does not always
work). If you are considering growing a legume, try growing a few plants in
the field first, then check the plant roots for nodules. If there are nodules, you
probably do not need to inoculate.
Speeding up germination
You do not need to treat most types of cover crop seeds. But if you need stylo
and some types of sunn hemp seeds to germinate quickly, put them in hot
water for 5–15 minutes before planting them. This is a good idea only in areas
with reliable rainfall: if they don’t get enough moisture to germinate, soaked
seeds will rot.
Spreading mucuna in Benin

Mucuna (velvetbean, Mucuna pruriens) is one of the most promising cover crops in West
Africa. Soils here are fairly infertile, farmers use little fertilizer, and the soil degrades
easily if it is used intensively. Farmers traditionally use shifting cultivation, clearing land to
grow crops, and then allowing it to lie fallow for several years so the fertility can recover.
However, rising populations mean that farmers can no longer leave the land fallow for
long enough for the soil to rebuild its fertility.
Researchers and extensionists first tested mucuna with farmers in southwestern Benin
in 1988–1992. Farmers in densely populated areas were interested in adopting the crop
because they could no longer practise shifting cultivation.
The farmers like using mucuna as a fallow crop because it suppresses speargrass
(Imperata cylindrica), a major weed in this area. They are more likely to adopt the crop in
areas with a long growing season (7 months or more), where the soil fertility is declining,
inorganic fertilizers are expensive, and where weeds such as speargrass are a problem.
Mucuna can also provide livestock feed, and suppresses Striga weeds and nematodes
in intensified cereal cropping. Close contacts between farmers and development organi-
zations are needed encourage the spread of mucuna, as are markets for the seed.

When to plant cover crops
You can plant cover crops in many ways. Here are some possibilities:
Intercropping
Planting at the same time as the main crop. This is easy because you can plant
both crops at the same time. It is suitable for sub-humid and humid areas. A
possible problem is that the cover crop might grow so quickly that it smothers
the main crop. Also, you cannot plant a cover crop this way if you are already
intercropping a cereal (e.g., maize) with beans.
Relay cropping
Planting when you weed the main crop. This is suitable for sub-humid and
humid areas. You can plant the cover crop when you do the first weeding
(usually about 4 weeks after planting the main crop). Or if you are intercrop-
ping maize and beans, you can plant the cover crop when you harvest the
beans.
Sequential planting
Planting after you harvest the main crop. In dry areas, you can plant the cover
crop when you harvest the main crop. This prevents the cover crop from com-
A question of cover
Here are some questions to help you decide when to plant the cover crop.
Questions about the cover crop itself
How much moisture will the cover crop need to grow and produce enough mulch and
seed?
At what time of year will there be enough moisture for the cover crop to grow?
What other factors (temperature, frost) will favour or hinder its growth? Is it sensitive
to the day length? To frost? To drought?
How easy will it be to manage the cover crop while it is growing and afterwards
(mulch management)?
Questions about the cropping system
When will cover be most needed?
How fast will the cover crop grow and provide the required cover?
How long will the cover last?
Might anything (grazing by animals, burning, etc.) reduce the amount of cover?
How to stop the cover crop and main crop from interfering with each other?

93
5 Soil Cover
Is there a market for cover crop seeds?
In 1998, a project in Uganda introduced farmers to lablab, mucuna, tephrosia and crota-
laria. These cover crops were popular: demand for the seed was far greater than the
supply. Some farmers and farmer groups agreed to multiply the seed. They sold the seed
to local farmers and people in the neighbouring district. Lablab seed sold for the highest
price.
But as more and more farmers produced seeds, the local market became saturated, and
selling seed began to be difficult. Local community organizations and NGOs helped to
market the seed in other districts and even abroad.
It is fairly easy for farmers in an area to produce enough cover crop seed for their own use,
but they may need outside help if they are to market their seed successfully elsewhere.
peting for moisture with the main crop. You can use the cover crop to provide
extra mulch and to produce livestock feed. Harvest water to make sure there is
enough moisture to grow the cover crop (see Chapter 8).
If you live in a semi-arid area with only one rainy season, you can plant a
drought-tolerant cover crop such as lablab between your rows of maize. Leave
the cover crop in the field after the maize harvest so it covers the soil and
suppresses weeds. Before the next season’s rains, slash it or roll it, and leave it
on the ground as mulch.
See Chapter 6 for more information on different types of cropping systems.
How to plant cover crops
You can plant a cover crop as an intercrop (or relay crop) or in a pure stand.
For cover crops with large seeds, plant with a hand hoe, jab planter or animal-
drawn direct planter (for pure stands).
You can broadcast cover crops with small seeds (such as finger millet), pro-
vided the soil cover is not too thick. If the soil cover is thick, sow the seeds in
lines by hand or use a seed drill.
The plant spacing and number of seeds per hole depend on several factors.
Use a narrower spacing in pure stands, and a wider spacing in mixed (in-
tercropped) stands.
Use a wider spacing in drier areas, so the plants don’t compete with each
other for moisture.
The number of seeds per hole depends on the amount of moisture avail-
able: fewer seeds per hole in dry areas; more in wetter areas. In general,
plant 2–4 seeds per hole.

94
Conservation Agriculture
Do cover crops need weeding?
Yes! You will need to weed cover crops at least once while they are becoming
established. Once they have covered the soil well, they will prevent most weeds
from germinating.
If you are intercropping or relay cropping your cover crop with maize or sor-
ghum, plan to weed according to the requirements of the cereal crop. Make
sure the cover crop does not tangle with the cereal crop.
Controlling pests and diseases
In parts of Kenya and Tanzania, farmers plant lablab as the only cover crop.
In some villages, quite large areas are covered with the same crop. Farmers in
these villages risk a pest outbreak that may ruin their cover crop.
How to reduce the danger of pests and diseases:
Rotate the types of crops grown: food, cover and cash crops.
Select cover crops that are unlikely to be attacked by pests.
Plant various different types of cover crops.
Use chemical spray.
Harvesting and seed storage
Harvest the seeds before you slash a cover crop to make mulch. You may need
to harvest the seeds for several reasons: so you can plant the cover crop next
season, if you want to use the seeds as food or fodder, or if you want to sell
them to other farmers.
Store cover crop seeds well. Here are a few tips on how to handle them:
Collect seeds from several plants so you get a range of seeds.
Dry the seeds and treat them with insecticide. If you want to use the seeds
for food, make sure that the insecticide is not harmful.
Keep seeds for planting in partly opened bags or in containers in a well-
ventilated store.
Take the seeds out and dry them again regularly. Throw out any bad seeds.
Preparing to plant the main crop
At the beginning of the next season, your field may have a cover crop, stalks
still standing from the previous main crop, and of course, weeds. You need to
prepare the field so you can plant the next main crop. You can do this in
several ways: by slashing the cover crop and weeds with a machete or hoe,

using a knife roller to bend over and crush the standing vegetation, or by using
a herbicide.
It may be better to use a knife roller to crush the vegetation rather than slash-
ing it, because equipment such as rippers and planters can easily drag pieces
of vegetation along with them.
See Chapters 3 and 7 for more information on how to prepare the land for
planting.

Conservation Agriculture
Using cover crops for food and feed
Cover crops are new for many farmers who switch to conservation agricul-
ture. Some (such as Canavalia and sunn hemp) need to be dried or processed
before they can be fed to livestock. As more and more farmers take up conser-
vation agriculture, you may be able to sell cover crop seeds to your neighbours
or in the market.
Various cover crops can be used as food and feed. Livestock can be fed forage
from many cover crops directly, though it is necessary to dry some, such as
jackbean and sunn hemp, before giving then to animals.
Seeds from cowpeas, lablab, lucerne and pigeonpea can be cooked and eaten
as part of a nutritious diet. Mucuna seeds need special treatment to remove
poisonous substances (see the boxes below).
Lablab recipes
Lablab seeds are used for food in the same way as dry beans. They are rich in protein and
are especially suitable for HIV/AIDS patients, nursing mothers and old people. Some
recipes from Tanzania and Kenya:
Mix lablab seeds with shelled maize and cook for at least 1 hour. Then mix with sour
milk. Serve hot or cold.
Cook the seeds for 1 hour and serve with cooked banana and rice.
Boil the seeds for 30 minutes. Give the soup to women early in their pregnancy to
reduce bleeding.
Cook lablab leaves and serve as a vegetable.
More information: Thomas Loronyo and John Odingo
Making mucuna fit to eat
Mucuna seeds are very nutritious and can be fed to cattle, sheep and goats without
processing. But they contain a substance that is poisonous to people, chickens or pigs.
This poison can be removed in several ways:
Soak the seeds for at least 48 hours, changing the water every 12 hours.
Crack the seeds and soak them in running water (from a faucet) for 36 hours.
Put the seeds in a cloth bag and leave them in a flowing river for 3 days.
Crack the seeds, boil them for 90 minutes, take the hulls off, then grind them and
make a soup.

5 Soil Cover
Mulch
Mulch may come from different sources:
Cover crops, slashed, crushed or sprayed to kill them.
Crop residues from the field itself.
Prunings from trees and shrubs.
Other plant materials brought in from outside the field.
Mulch requires management for land preparation and planting of crops.
Mulch from a cover crop
Some types of cover crop produce a thick layer of living and dead plant mate-
rial on the ground. Before you plant a new crop, you have to flatten this mass
and kill the living plants so they do not compete with your crop. You can do
this in several ways:
Slashing the cover crop with a machete.
Breaking the stems with an animal- or tractor-drawn roller-chopper
Applying herbicides.
You can plant the new crop directly through the mulch layer (see Chapter 3).
Mulch from crop residues
Many annual crops are good sources of mulch after harvesting. Cut the stalks
of cereals and lay them on the ground to cover the soil. If you have not yet
planted a cover crop, this may be the only source of soil cover.
In some areas, it may not be possible to grow a cover crop. For example, in
semi-arid areas, there may not be enough water to grow a cover crop in the
dry season. Leaving crop residues in the field is a good option in these areas.
Residues from different crops decompose at different rates. Cereal stalks de-
compose slowly, so stay on the soil for longer. Legumes rot quickly (so quickly
release their nutrients, which can be used by the next season’s crop).
To keep the soil covered for a long time, a mixture of legumes and grassy spe-
cies is best.
Farmers in many areas remove as many of the residues as possible so they can
use it as livestock feed or thatch. Or they allow animals into the field after
harvest to graze on the stubble. Here are some better alternatives:
Leave as much residue on the land as you can, given your other needs.
Consider collecting some of the leaves (which are more palatable to live-
stock) but leaving the rest of the leaves and the stalks on the field.

98
Conservation Agriculture
Control grazing to prevent animals from trampling and compacting the
soil, and to stop them from eating all the crop residue.
Find other sources of livestock feed and building materials. For example,
plant a forage plot to feed to animals, and plant a woodlot for building
poles.
Mulch from trees and shrubs
Trees and shrubs produce a lot of leaves and twigs that can be used as soil
cover and as animal fodder. They also have many other advantages:
Leguminous trees and shrubs fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.
Trees and shrubs improve the structure of the soil and reduce compaction.
They shade the soil and act as windbreaks, so reducing the soil tempera-
ture and help to conserve moisture.
They prevent erosion.
They provide fodder (see Chapter 9), food, medicine, firewood, timber,
thatch and fencing.
They produce fruit and attract bees that can be used for honey.
Farmers can choose from many different trees and shrubs:
Multipurpose trees Various types of trees provide timber, fruit, fodder,
and shelter. Rows of trees planted along the contours reduce runoff and
erosion. You can prune the branches or collect the leaf litter and spread it
on the ground in between the rows to protect the soil.
Living fences Species such as Acacia, Ziziphus, Grevillia and Cassia can
be planted as live fences and windbreaks. You can prune them to produce
fencing, firewood and fodder, as well as mulch.
Leguminous shrubs Shrubs such as Crotalaria, Tephrosia, Sesbania and
Gliricidia replenish the soil by fixing nitrogen from the air. You can grow
them in rotation with maize and sorghum, then cut them to produce mate-
rial for mulch, fencing and fodder. None of the leguminous shrubs are ed-
ible, but most can be used as fodder and firewood. When these shrubs
flower, they attract bees – perhaps you can use them to produce honey?
Leguminous shrubs produce seeds 8–12 months after planting – longer than a
single season. The seeds can be hard to find. You may be able to obtain them
from the same sources as for cover crops (see page 89). It may be a good idea to
set up a nursery, either by yourself or with a group of other farmers. Some
farmers make money by selling seeds and firewood. You may be able to collect
seeds of certain shrubs from the bush.
Farmers may be reluctant to plant leguminous shrubs because they cannot use
the land to grow a food crop during the short rainy season. However, in most
cases the legume will improve the soil fertility so much that the higher yields in

99
5
Soil Cover
the long rains more than make up for the loss of output in the short rainy
season. Another attraction is that growing leguminous shrubs takes little work.
Pruning trees and using the leaves and branches as soil cover is common, but
it can be a lot of work. To reduce the amount of work, plant trees on your farm
and as living fences close to your conservation agriculture fields.
Mulch from other plant materials
If you do not have enough mulch from crop residues or a cover crop, consider
bringing in extra materials from outside. You can slash vegetation growing
around the field or nearby, and spread them on your field. You can also grow
trees and shrubs especially to use as mulch (see the section above).
Bringing in mulch from outside takes a lot of work, but it may be possible to do
it when you first start conservation agriculture, to protect the soil before you
have been able to plant a cover crop.
Make sure you do not spread weeds or cause other problems when you bring
in this vegetation.
Do not use Striga or couchgrass (Cynodon dactylon) as mulch. Burn them
instead.
Do not use weeds that have already flowered and produced seeds as mulch.
Slash them before they have had a chance to produce flower, or use them
to make compost (composting kills most seeds).
Do not use mulch that can spread diseases to your crop.
You can use sawdust or rice husks as mulch, but be careful: they can cause
soil fertility problems. For example, they can soak up nitrogen from the
soil, leaving less for your crops.
Crop rotation with leguminous shrubs
In western Kenya, many farmers leave their fields fallow for one or more seasons. They
grow maize intercropped with beans in the long rainy season. When they harvest the
beans, they plant leguminous shrubs in the former bean rows, and leave them to grow in
the short rainy season. The most common shrubs are Crotalaria grahamiana, Crotalaria
paulina, Tephrosia candida, Tephrosia vogelii, Sesbania sesban and Gliricidia sepium.
When they prepare the land in February or March, the farmers cut the shrubs. They use
some of the leaves and twigs as fodder, and leave the rest on the ground as mulch. They
use the stems as firewood, for fencing, or as stakes to support tomatoes and passion
fruit.
Some farmers like to plant Crotalaria grahamiana and Tephrosia candida because they
flower early and attract bees, so increasing honey production.

Challenges for maintaining soil cover
Here are some problems you may encounter with soil cover, and ways to over-
come them.
Semi-arid areas
In semi-arid areas, where there is little rain and most of it falls in one season,
establishing a cover crop may be difficult. Crops, shrubs and trees produce
few residues, and farmers often need them for feed or building materials. Cover
crops use precious water.
It may be impossible to maintain soil cover for the whole year. You may
have to rely on crop residues and prunings from trees and shrubs as the
main source of soil cover.
Diseases and pests
Diseases and insect pests might attack the cover crop and will require special
attention. Farmers often use fire to destroy pests and diseases. But this leaves
the soil bare and destroys valuable organic matter.
Rotate crops rather than burning them to control pests and diseases. Con-
sider using insecticides if necessary.
Rats
A dense cover crop may encourage rats, which may attack the crop.
Slash the live cover crop as close to the ground as possible before planting
the crop. It may also be necessary to trap rats or bait the rats with poison.
Caution: Keep poisons out of reach of children!
Rotating crops helps to control rats because it interrupts their food supply
and disturbs their living conditions.
Termites
Many farmers fear that soil cover will attract termites.
Termites are important because they break down plant material on the
surface and carry into the soil, where it adds to soil organic matter. They
also help aerate the soil and improve infiltration by water.
Most types of termites are beneficial: only a few types attack crops. They
may eat the stems or damage the grain. This normally happens towards
harvest time. Leave plant material (such as cover crops) on the surface so

101
5 Soil Cover
the termites attack this rather than the crop itself. The crop can be har-
vested before they do any damage to it.
Fire
Bushfires or uncontrolled fires on neighbouring fields can spread into a con-
servation agriculture field and destroy its soil cover. To prevent this, you can
leave a buffer zone around your field.
Once many farmers in the area practise conservation agriculture, burning
will be less of a problem. Bylaws and education are needed to reduce dam-
age by uncontrolled fires.
Livestock
Livestock need to be fed. Farmers often allow them to graze on stubble or on
fallow fields, and other livestock owners may not keep their animals out of a
field planted to a cover crop. This may especially be a problem in dry years or
in semi-arid areas, where few alternative sources of feed are available.
You can keep livestock out of your fields by planting living fences, by spray-
ing the field boundaries with cattle urine, or by planting fences or cover
crops that cattle do not like to eat.
You can also try to negotiate with your neighbours (or persuade the village
leaders) to find alternative grazing arrangements – such as identifying al-
ternative sources of forage or pasture. Or you may be able to restrict graz-
ing to those times when the soil cover is dense and the soil is not too wet.
See Chapter 9 for more on livestock.
Information
Farmers need information and training on how to maintain soil cover.
Try to get information and training from extension workers, non-govern-
ment organizations, or nearby research institutes. Visit other farmers to
find out how they maintain cover on their soil.

Crops and
cropping systems

104
Conservation Agriculture
Y
OU PROBABLY have many different combinations of crops on your farm, and
you manage each combination in a different way. For example, you may
grow vegetables close to your house, using manure and supplemental irriga-
tion, with a fence around the plot to protect it. You may plant cereals in fields
further away, without irrigation but using chemical fertilizer and herbicides.
Farmers have many reasons for making these choices. Fields are different sizes,
have different types of soil, and may be on a slope or on flat land. Some are
close to the house, while others are further away. Perhaps you don’t have the
time to plant or weed at certain times of year. Or maybe different members of
your family want to grow different things. What you plant depends on how
much moisture is in the soil and whether the rains are early, on time, or late.
And of course it depends on what you want to grow for your own use and to
sell.
Cropping systems
You can choose from many different types of crops, and you can plant them in
different combinations. Here are some options:
Monocropping
Example
Planting maize year after year in the same field.
This is where the field is used to grow only one crop season after season. This
has several disadvantages: it is difficult to maintain cover on the soil; it en-
courages pests, diseases and weeds; and it can reduce the soil fertility and
damage the soil structure. So avoid monocropping if you can. It is much better
to rotate crops, or use intercropping or strip cropping.
Crop rotation
Example
Planting maize one year, and beans the next.
This means changing the type of crops grown in the field each season or each
year (or changing from crops to fallow). Crop rotation is a key principle of
conservation agriculture because it improves the soil structure and fertility,
and because it helps control weeds, pests and diseases (see page 106).
Sequential cropping
Example
Planting maize in the long rains, then beans during the short rains.
This involves growing two crops in the same field, one after the other in the
same year. In some places, the rainy season is long enough to grow two crops:
either two main crops, or one main crop followed by a cover crop. Growing

105
6 Crops and Cropping Systems
two crops may also be possible if there are two rainy seasons, or if there is
enough moisture left in the soil to grow a second crop. If the crops are differ-
ent, this is a crop rotation (see above).
Intercropping
Examples
Planting alternating rows
of maize and beans, or growing a
cover crop in between the cereal rows.
This means growing a two or more
crops in the same field at the same
time. It is possible to do this in differ-
ent ways:
Broadcasting the seeds of both
crops, or dibbling the seeds with-
out any row arrangement. This is
called mixed intercropping. It is
easy to do but makes weeding, fer-
tilization and harvesting difficult.
Individual plants may compete
with each other because they are
too close together.
Planting the main crop in rows
and then broadcasting the seeds of
the intercrop (such as a cover
crop).
Planting both the main crop and
the intercrop in rows. This is called
row intercropping. The rows make
weeding and harvesting easier
than with mixed intercropping.
A possible problem is that the inter-
crop may compete with the main crop
for light, water and nutrients. This
may reduce the yields of both crops.
Strip cropping
Example
Planting alternating strips of
maize, soybean and finger millet.
This involves planting broad strips of
several crops in the field. Each strip is
3–9 m wide. On slopes, the strips can
Row intercropping with alternate rows of a
cereal and a grass cover crop
Row intercropping with alternate rows of
maize and beans

Mixed intercropping: no rows

106
Conservation Agriculture
be laid out along the contour to prevent erosion. The next year, the farmer can
rotate crops by planting each strip with a different crop.
Strip cropping has many of the advantages of intercropping: it produces a
variety of crops, the legume improves the soil fertility, and rotation helps re-
duce pest and weed problems. The residues from one strip can be used as soil
cover for neighbouring strips. At the same time, strip cropping avoids some of
the disadvantages of intercropping: managing the single crop within the strip
is easy, and competition between the crops is reduced.
Relay cropping
Example
Planting maize, then sowing beans between the maize rows four
weeks later.
This is growing one crop, then planting another crop (usually a cover crop) in
the same field before harvesting the first. This helps avoid competition between
the main crop and the intercrop. It also uses the field for a longer time, since
the cover crop usually continues to grow after the main crop is harvested.
Crop rotation
Rotating crops is one of the key principles of conservation agriculture. It has
many advantages:
It improves the soil structure
Some crops have strong, deep roots. They
can break up hardpans, and tap moisture and nutrients from deep in the
soil. Others have many fine, shallow roots. They tap nutrients near the
surface and bind the soil. They form many tiny holes so that air and water
can get into the soil.
It increases soil fertility
Legumes (such as groundnuts and beans) fix
nitrogen in the soil. When their green parts and roots rot, this nitrogen can
Unhappy marriages
Make sure that your crops will grow together well. Here are some examples of some
unhappy marriages:
A climbing cover crop may clamber up tall crops such as maize and cotton. If it grows
too well, it may shade the taller crop and reduce its yield. (Choose a creeping variety
of the cover crop instead.)
Intercropping lablab with cotton may contaminate the cotton fibre, so lower its price.
Mucuna can take over a maize field too quickly and make it difficult to harvest the
maize. (Plant the mucuna later so it does not have a chance to smother the main
crop.)

107
6
Crops and Cropping Systems
be used by other crops such as maize. The result is higher, more stable
yields, without the need to apply expensive inorganic fertilizer.
It helps control weeds, pests and diseases
Planting the same crop sea-
son after season encourages certain weeds, insects and diseases. Planting
different crops breaks their life cycle and prevents them from multiplying.
It produces different types of output
Growing a mix of grain, beans,
vegetables and fodder means a more varied diet and more types of pro-
duce to sell.
It reduces risk
A single crop may fail because of drought. It may be at-
tacked by pests. Or its market price may be low when time comes to sell it.
Producing several different crops reduces these risks.
In some ways, crop rotation takes the place of ploughing the soil: it helps aer-
ate the soil, recycles nutrients, and helps control weeds, pests and diseases.
Intercropping, strip cropping and relay cropping bring many of the same
advantages as rotation. Even so, it is a good idea to rotate crops even if you use
these approaches.

Selecting crops
Choosing the right crops and crop combinations
You probably already know which main crops you want to grow. You prob-
ably want to plant maize (or whatever the staple food in your area is), beans
(nutritious and a good source of protein), vegetables (needed for a healthy
diet) and some fodder for your animals.
But you may want to grow other crops too. You may have several fields, and
you can try different crops on each. And which cover crop should you choose?
Some things to consider when choosing crops:
What does it produce?
Crops produce many different things: food, fod-
der, firewood, fence poles, thatch and medicines. Farmers grow some crops
(such as cotton) only for cash. For other crops, such as cereals or vegeta-
bles, you may be able to sell what you do not use yourself. Make sure there
is a market for the output.
Will it grow well?
This depends on many things: the amount of rain or
moisture in the soil, the season (some crops and varieties do not grow well
at certain times of year), the soil fertility, and so on.
Healthy soil from crop rotations
Farmers in Busia and Vihiga districts, western Kenya, are using leguminous shrubs to
increase the fertility of their soils.
The farmers used to grow maize year after year, with few inputs. Their soils were com-
pacted and infertile, and were eroding away. Maize yields were less than 1 t/ha.
Beginning in 1999, an ICRAF project known as IMPALA has worked with the farmers to
find a solution to these problems. The project introduced zero-tillage and various legumi-
nous shrubs (Crotalaria spp., Tephrosia spp., Gliricidia sepium and Sesbania sesban).
The farmers intercrop maize and beans in the long rains, then plant the shrubs and let
them grow in the short rainy season.
Towards the beginning of the long rains, they slash the shrubs and leave them on the
surface as mulch. Two weeks later they plant maize and beans again through the mulch.
In 2001, just 2 years after starting conservation agriculture, one farmer harvested 1.9 tons
of maize per hectare. By 2004, the same farmer was harvesting 3.2 t/ha.
The shrubs and mulch controlled weeds and smothered the most aggressive grasses.
Striga infestation has fallen. The soil is now darker and softer, and has more organic
matter.
The benefits do not stop there. Farmers can produce enough firewood for their own use
and can sell bundles of wood at KSh 20 each. The shrubs attract bees, so one farmer
was able to make KSh 18,000 worth of honey. Another produced 90 kg of Tephrosia
seeds, which he sold for KSh 15,000.

6 Crops and Cropping Systems
Questions about crops
Choose one of the crops that you grow, and think about it for a few minutes. How would
you describe it?
Is it a food crop? Forage? A cash crop?
Is it short or tall?
How many days or weeks does it grow in the field?
Can it withstand drought well?
All these are important. But did you think of these things?
How well does it cover the soil?
What type of roots does it have?
Does it improve the soil fertility?
These are important questions to answer if you want to make the best possible use of
different crops under conservation agriculture.
What inputs are needed? How much work does it take to grow the crop?
Can you get seed? Do you need other inputs, such as fertilizer or insecti-
cide?
What are the roots like? Tall ce-
reals (millet, maize, sorghum), fin-
ger millets and some legumes (e.g.,
pigeonpea and sunn hemp) have
strong roots that penetrate deep
into the soil – up to 1.2 m for tall
cereals. Their roots improve the soil
structure and porosity, so are a
good choice if the soil is compacted
(see Chapter 3).
Does it improve the soil fertility?
Legumes improve the soil fertility by fixing nitrogen from the air. They use
part of it for their own needs, and leave the rest in the soil. Cereals and
other plants can use this nitrogen if they are intercropped with the legume,
or if they are grown as the next crop in the rotation.
Does it cover the soil well?
Tall cereals do not cover the soil well be-
cause they have upright leaves and they are planted far apart. Short grasses
(Brachiaria, Cenchrus, Andropogon) and many legumes (lablab, groundnut,
cowpea, beans) cover the ground very quickly after they are planted. When
their main use is indeed to provide cover, we call them cover crops. If their
main use is to provide food, we call them food legumes (beans, ground-
nuts).
Does it work with other crops?
Try to find combinations of crops that
complement each other well. For example, cereals grow well with legumes
Different crops have different types of roots

Conservation Agriculture
New rice varieties around Lake Alaotra, Madagascar
Farmers around Lake Alaotra usually do not plant rice in rainfed or poorly irrigated areas
because their traditional varieties do not grow well there.
Researchers introduced two varieties (Sebota 281 and Agronorte 147) from Brazil. These
new varieties can produce more than 6 tons/ha under normal irrigation, and still yield
around 2 ton/ha under poor irrigation or in rainfed conditions, where traditional varieties
would fail to produce a harvest.
The new varieties can be planted directly in the mulch of winter legumes, without field
preparation. This means that more moisture is available during years when little water is
available for irrigation.
More information: Olivier Husson, CIRAD
(either food legumes or cover crops): the cereals benefit from the nitrogen
fixed by the legume. Two different legumes or two different cereals do not
usually work well together. If you have problems with Striga in your field,
you may want to grow trap crops such as Crotalaria or Tephrosia to encour-
age the Striga to germinate and die when they do not find any suitable
plants (such as maize or sorghum) they can live off.
It may be more difficult to find the right combination of crops for your situa-
tion. You and your neighbours can try out new combinations to see which
ones work. Or you can check with extension workers, researchers or farmers
in other villages to see what they suggest.
Choosing the right varieties
Farmers all know that not all sorghum is the same. Some varieties grow quickly
and produce a yield in a short time. Others take longer until harvest. Some are
taller than others, or produce more leaves. Some respond better to fertilizer,
some are more tolerant to drought or Striga.
The same is true for other crops. For example, some varieties of cowpeas can
be harvested in 55 days; others take more than 100 days. Some climb, while
others crawl on the ground.
Choose a variety that has the characteristics you want. Make sure you get
the right seed.
If you find a variety that you like, consider producing your own seed to
sow in the future (see page 91).
Choosing a crop rotation
What crops should you plant next year, and the year after that? That depends
on many things – see the questions above about crops and crop combinations.

6 Crops and Cropping Systems
Here are some extra considerations.
See if you can modify your existing cropping system so it is better suited to
conservation agriculture. It is easier to adjust an existing system than to
come up with one that is a completely new.
Consider changing the main crop in your field. For example, if you nor-
mally grow maize, consider planting sorghum next year. If you have sev-
eral fields, you can use a different one each year to plant your main crop.
Change the cover crop you grow. If you planted lablab this year, you might
sow mucuna next year.
Challenges in cropping systems
Here are some problems you may encounter with cropping systems, and some
ways to overcome them.
Pests and diseases
Certain insect pests and diseases may spread easily from one crop to the next
through the crop residues.
Avoid crop combinations where this is a problem.
Markets
Markets do not always exist for new crops you may want to plant as part of
your rotation. It may be hard to find seed, you can’t find anyone to buy the
yield, or prices are too low to make it worthwhile growing the crop.
Check the source of seeds and price of the output before you decide which
crops to plant. It may be worthwhile getting together with your neigh-
bours to grow a certain crop, then transport it to a market in a bigger town.
Adapting an existing cropping system
It may be easy to convert an existing cropping system to conservation agriculture.
In conventional maize cropping in humid western Kenya, farmers can start by plant-
ing lablab as a cover crop between the maize rows, 2–3 weeks after planting the
maize
In northern Cameroon, farmers can plant Brachiaria, a grass cover crop, at the same
time as cotton (see the next page).
Both of these are easy because they adapt what farmers already do.

114
Conservation Agriculture
From conventional to conservation: Cereal/cotton rotations in
northern Cameroon
Farmers in northern Cameroon grow cereal and cotton in rotation. Here is how they can
switch to conservation agriculture.
Year 1
Cereals
1
If necessary, plough to remove any ridges and furrows left from the previous season
This is necessary in the first year only. If the ground surface is even, do not plough.
2
Treat the fields with a pre-emergence herbicide such as atrazine. (Do not use atra-
zine if crotalaria is growing because atrazine will kill it.) If there are many weeds, it
may be necessary to apply gramoxone or glyphosate along with atrazine. Make sure
that you control weeds well at this stage: it is difficult to do so once the cover crop is
growing.
3
Plant the cereal in rows using the same methods and plant spacings as usual.
4
Plant the cover crop between the cereal rows using the guidelines in the table below.
(These recommendations are for northern Cameroon. Adapt them for your own area.)
5
Grow and harvest the cereal crop.
6
Leave the crop residues on the field. Prevent animals from grazing on them.
Year 2
Cotton
1
Control weeds. Use diuron (a pre-emergence herbicide). If weeds are already grow-
ing, use paraquat or glyphosate to control them.
2
Sow cotton through the residue as early as possible. Use treated seeds to prevent
attacks by insects. Sow the cotton seeds in the rows previously used for the cover
crop. Sow at the same plant spacing as usual.

Crops and Cropping Systems
Knowledge, skills and labour
Managing rotations properly requires more skills than a single crop. It also
needs work at different times of year. People may be reluctant to try out new
crops because they are not used to growing or eating them.
Try out the new crops on a small scale first so you can learn from your
mistakes. Visit other farmers who are already growing the crop, or ask an
extension worker for advice. Ask about ways to use or sell the output, or
recipes for how to cook it.
Conservation agriculture fuels firewood production
Firewood is perhaps not the first thing most farmers would think of when they consider
switching to conservation agriculture.
But for farmers in western Kenya, it is one of the main ways they benefit from this new
approach. They rotate their maize with Tephrosia candida and Sesbania sesban. They
have found that growing these leguminous shrubs for 8 months can supply three-quar-
ters of their firewood needs. And if they leave them in the field for 18 months, they have lots
of wood to sell.
Firewood is scarce in western Kenya, and farmers and their children spend a lot of time
searching for it. Conservation agriculture is saving them the effort and making them
money at the same time. And it is helping conserve the area’s remaining forests too.

Controlling weeds

118
Conservation Agriculture
Weeds are thieves
They take light, water and food away
from your crops.
They push the crops out of their liv-
ing space.
They shelter pests and diseases that
attack the crop.
The longer you leave them, the harder
they are to control. Control them before
they steal your yield!
W
EEDS ARE any plants that grow where they are not wanted. They compete
with the cultivated crops for nutrients, moisture, sunlight, and space.
They shelter pests and diseases that attack the crop. They reduce crop yields
and farmers’ incomes. Controlling weeds can be a lot of work.
In conventional farming, tillage (turning the soil over) is a major way to con-
trol weeds. Farmers plough repeatedly in order to suppress weeds and have  a
clean field when they plan their crop. Ploughing buries many weed seeds, but
it also brings other seeds back to the surface, where they can germinate. Burn-
ing crop residues may also stimulate the growth of some types of weeds.
Conservation agriculture reduces weed numbers in several ways:
It disturbs the soil less, so brings fewer buried weed seeds to the surface
where they can germinate.
The cover on the soil (intercrops, cover crops or mulch) smothers weeds
and prevents them from growing.
Rotating crops prevents certain types of weeds from multiplying.
How to manage
weeds
Controlling weeds is vital in conser-
vation agriculture. If you do not con-
trol weeds properly, they may take
over your field, and you will be left
with little or no yield! It is important
to control weeds at the right time, be-
fore they become a problem. Do not
allow them to compete with the crops,
and do not let them grow long enough
to produce seeds. You may have to
slash weeds even after harvesting the
crop in order to prevent them from
producing seeds.
Weeds can be a big problem when you first start using conservation agricul-
ture. You may have to work hard in the first couple of years to control weeds.
Be patient! If you do it properly, weeds will become less of a problem later on.
You can manage weeds in many different ways (see also Photos 28–34):
Using crops and other forms of soil cover.
By hand weeding or using equipment to cut or crush the weeds.
Using herbicides.
We will discuss each of them in turn.

119
7 Controlling Weeds
You will probably need to use a combination of these methods to control weeds.
It is best to prevent weeds from growing by using various forms of soil cover.
These methods are cheap and avoid disturbing the soil. You can then kill any
weeds that do grow by using a hand hoe or machete, or with herbicides.
Managing weeds with soil cover and
crops
There are various ways to control weeds using crops and other forms of soil
cover. They include planting the main crop and intercrops at the right spac-
ings, planting cover crops, using mulch, rotating crops, and intercropping.
Crop spacing
You can plant crops closer together to shade weeds that try to grow in be-
tween. The best crop spacing suppresses weeds but avoids competition be-
tween individual crop plants. The ideal spacing depends on:
Soil moisture and temperature Weeds grow quickly in hot, wet areas, so
closer spacing is needed to smother them.
Soil fertility Weeds grow fast in fertile soil, so closer crop spacing is rec-
ommended.
Cover crops
Good cover crops spread over the soil quickly and suppress weeds before they
can grow.
Select cover crops that have several uses (food, fodder, fuelwood, etc.), and
that produce a lot of green matter that covers the surface rapidly. Cover crops
such as lablab can cover the soil completely 2 months after planting.
You may have to weed once to give the cover crop a chance to get established.
You can also use a pre-emergence herbicide after planting maize and lablab to
stop weed seedlings from emerging.
If the rainy season is long enough, consider planting the cover crop as a relay
crop. It will spread over the soil and smother weeds after you harvest the main
crop.
Some cover crops (such as black oats) control weeds by producing chemicals
that prevent weeds from growing.
See Chapter 5 for more information on cover crops.

120
Conservation Agriculture
Mulch
Weed seeds germinate easily if the soil is bare. Leaving the crop residue on the
surface as mulch makes it hard for weeds to grow because they do not have
enough space or light. Take care that the mulch does not smother emerging
crop seedlings. See Chapter 5 for more information on mulch.
In some cases (such as in semi-arid areas) it is difficult to get enough mulch to
cover the soil. Consider bringing in mulch from other fields. This takes more
work, but is probably worthwhile. The mulch will not only manage weeds; it
will also reduce the soil temperatures, conserve moisture, encourage water to
sink into the soil, and add organic matter.
Take care not to bring in mulch that can spread weed seeds! Do not use as
mulch plants that have flowered and produced seeds.
Crop rotation
Planting a different crop on each field breaks the life cycle of weeds. There are
fewer weeds, and they are easier to control. A good crop rotation prevents the
buildup of weed populations. If you cannot rotate your main crop, try to plant
a different cover crop or intercrop each season.
See Chapter 6 for more information on crop rotations.
Mulch suppresses weeds, so saves time
when you prepare the field for planting
No mulch? Get ready to spend a lot of
time preparing the field and fighting
weeds!

121
7
Controlling Weeds
Intercropping
Intercropping helps cover the soil and smother weeds that grow between the
rows of the main crop. Choose a crop that spreads quickly and produces a lot
of vegetation. Legumes, pumpkins and sweet potatoes are a good choice.
Weeding by hand or with equipment
Hand weeding
You can pull out weeds by hand, or slash them with a machete, sickle, slasher
or billhook. You can also use a hoe for weeding, but this disturbs the soil sur-
face. Hand weeding is often the job of women and children.
Here are some advantages of hand weeding:
Uprooting weeds by hand disturbs the soil less than using most types of
equipment. Try not to disturb the soil too much if you use a hoe or other
implements.
Hand tools are cheap and can be bought in most markets.
Hand weeding has several disadvantages:
It is hard work and takes a long time.
The weeds may regrow easily.
The stalks may not be crushed well, making it difficult to plant crops through
the residue.
Animal- and tractor-drawn weeders
To use an animal- or tractor-drawn weeder, plant the crops in rows with the
same spacing as the cultivator blades.
Weeding by draught animal or tractor power is quicker and easier than by
hand. Using an animal-drawn weeder can take less than one-fifth of the time
needed for hand hoeing.
However, weeders have several disadvantages:
They can damage crop roots. This may be a problem especially in arid and
semi-arid areas.
They disturb the soil. They bring up weed seeds to the surface and let them
germinate more easily. That means more weeding later on.
They may carry weed seeds from place to place.
They do not work properly if the field has crop residues or mulch from
cover crops.

122
Conservation Agriculture
Knife-rollers
A knife-roller kills the cover crop and
weeds by bending them over and
crushing them. It is used before plant-
ing the main crop. It can be pulled by
draught animals or by a tractor. Knife-
rollers are fairly simple, and can be
designed and made locally.
Herbicides
In some places, there are not enough people to do the weeding. If this is the
case, consider using herbicides.
Herbicides are quick and easy to apply, and do not disturb the soil. Some her-
bicides kill only certain types of weeds.
Not many smallholder farmers use herbicides because they are expensive and
hard to find. They also need special equipment, such as sprayers or wipers. It
is important to use the right amounts of chemicals, mix them with clean wa-
ter, and handle them safely. If you are considering using herbicides, get train-
ing on how to use them the right way.
Herbicides can be applied in different ways:
Weed wiper (such as a Zamwipe)
Knapsack sprayer
Hand-pulled sprayer
Animal-drawn sprayer
Tractor-mounted boom sprayer.
Knife-rollers and black oats
Farmers in Brazil plant black oats (Avena strigosa) as a cover crop. They use a knife-roller
or roller-chopper to kill the oats after flowering but before the seeds have matured. The
best time to do this is when the oats have reached the milk stage (squeeze the grains and
a white liquid like milk comes out). This has two advantages: when the oats are this old,
the dead leaves and stalks stay on the ground as mulch for longer. And the oats do not
have a chance to produce seeds, which would be difficult to control.
The knife-roller crushes the cover crop, but does not cut it up. That means the residues
are not dragged along by the roller and do not get tangled in equipment.

Controlling Weeds
Weed wipers
A weed wiper looks like a broom with
a sponge on its head. A small tank on
the handle holds the herbicide, which
flows down into the sponge. The best-
known type of weed wiper is the
“Zamwipe”, used in Zambia.
Wipers are ideal for small farms. Use
them to apply herbicide on weeds be-
tween crop rows, or to kill cover crops
before planting the main crop.
Their advantages include:
They are light and easy to use, and
ideal for women farmers.
They are fairly cheap (about US$ 17) and easy to maintain.
They have low application rates (only 20–25 litres/ha), so use little water.
There is no risk of wasting herbicide or damaging the crop because of
spray drifting in the wind.
Wipers have some disadvantages:
They are useful only for small plots of land.
Farmers need to know how to use the wiper properly.
Wiping weeds on uneven ground is difficult.
The Zamwipe works best just before planting the main crop. Use it to kill
weeds that have started to regrow after they are slashed, when they are 10–
12 cm tall. Use it also to deal with individual weeds. It can also be used to
control weeds in between rows of maize or sorghum, when the crop is knee-
high – i.e., at the same time as when farmers normally weed their fields.
Never use dirty water, and clean the wiper immediately after use.
Knapsack sprayers
Many small-scale farmers already
have a knapsack sprayer. These
sprayers may be manual or powered
by a petrol engine. They are reason-
ably cheap and easily available.
Mounting a shield prevents the spray
from drifting onto crops, so the sprayer
can be used after the crop has
emerged. Knapsack sprayers are not
suitable for large farms.

sponge on one end and a bottle on the handle

Conservation Agriculture
Hand-pulled sprayers
Hand-pulled herbicide sprayers are
like a knapsack sprayer mounted on
wheels. When the wheels turn, they
pump the herbicide into a boom with
four or six spray nozzles. The height
of the boom can be adjusted to deal
with plants of different heights.
These sprayers are sometimes called
“pedestrian-pulled” sprayers.
They have more nozzles and a larger
tank than a knapsack sprayer, so can
cover a larger areas more evenly. They
are suitable for treating a whole field;
they cannot be used to spot-spray in-
dividual patches of weeds. Because the
spray is behind the operator (unlike with knapsack sprayers), there is much
less risk of breathing in the spray or getting it on your skin other clothing.
Animal-pulled sprayers
Animal-powered sprayers may have up to 10 nozzles (spaced about 50 cm
apart). They can be pulled by one or two animals. They have a larger capacity
than hand sprayers, so are suitable for larger areas.
Tractor-powered sprayers
Tractor-powered sprayers can be very sophisticated. They are suited for large
farms. It may be possible to hire someone to spray your farm with a tractor
sprayer, rather than investing in one yourself.
When and how to weed
After changing to conservation agriculture
When you first adopt conservation agriculture, weeds may be a big problem.
Conservation agriculture improves the soil fertility, so encourages weeds to
grow. African couch grass (Digitaria abyssinica) and yellow nutsedge (Cyperus
esculentus) may be a particular problem because they are difficult to uproot.

Controlling Weeds
There are a lot of weed seeds in the soil, and if you let them grow, they will
destroy your yield!
Here are some steps in controlling weeds. Adapt them to suit your own situa-
tion.
1
It is a good idea to slash weeds immediately after the harvest and during
the dry season to prevent them from producing seeds.
2
Before you plant, slash any plants (weeds, cover crop, stalks left over from
the previous crop) in the field. (A disadvantage with this is that it may
encourage grasses and certain other weeds to grow if it is wet.)
3
Dig planting pits with a hoe, or open planting furrows with a ripper or
subsoiler.
4
After the first rains have fallen, allow weeds to regrow or new weeds to
emerge. Wait about 2 weeks until they are growing vigorously, then apply
a post-emergence herbicide such as glyphosate using a Zamwipe or a
sprayer. This will kill all emerged weeds before you plant.
5
Immediately afterwards, plant the main crop.
6
Plant a cover crop between the rows of the main crop.
7
Check for weeds every week and control them by pulling them out by hand,
scraping the soil surface with a hoe, using an animal-drawn weeder, or
using a selective herbicides.
8
Harvest the main crop and allow the cover crop to grow.
9
Continue checking for weeds and pull them out before they can flower
and seed.
10 Harvest the cover crop seeds.
11 Manage (bend over and crush) the mixture of crop residues and cover crops
using a sickle, machete, knife-roller or another implement some 3 weeks
before you expect the first rains to begin.
In later years
If you control weeds diligently, they should be easier to control in later sea-
sons. It can take 3–5 years for the number of weeds in the soil to be reduced so
much that very few new weeds grow.
Leave the soil undisturbed, and keep the soil covered so that weed seeds do
not have a chance to germinate. Any weeds that are lucky to germinate have
no space or light, so they die.
You should still check for weeds regularly and pull out any you find. You may
also need to use herbicides to control weeds. But overall, weed control will be
a lot less work.

126
Conservation Agriculture
Challenges in managing weeds
The switch from conventional farming to conservation agriculture is the
most challenging time. Many farmers do not realize the importance of con-
trolling weeds, or they may not know how to do it without disturbing the
soil.
Weeding with hoes or with equipment pulled by animals or tractors is more
difficult because of the crop residues or mulch on the ground.
Farmers may be reluctant to use herbicides because of the expense, or be-
cause they do not have the right equipment.
Some critics of herbicides say they damage the environment or make peo-
ple ill. (Herbicides are safe as long as they are used and stored properly.)
Farmers may not know how to use sprayers properly, or how to spray the
right amount of herbicide. (See the guidelines below.)
Using the right amount of herbicide
If you use herbicides, it is important to make sure you apply the right amount.
If you do not, you risk either using too much (which is wasteful and expen-
sive) or too little (which will not control weeds properly).
Zamwipe
The Zamwipe manufacturer estimates that wiping the weeds or cover crop on
one hectare of land will use about 20 litres of liquid. The actual amount used
depends on the number of weeds (or cover crop) and how thorough the op-
erator is.
Here’s how to make sure you use the right amount of herbicide in a Zamwipe:
1
Fill the Zamwipe container with clean water. Do not put herbicide into the
tank.
2
Use the Zamwipe to wipe the weeds in a field until the container is empty.
3
Calculate the area you have wiped:
Area wiped with 1
container (m2)
x
Width of area

wiped (m)
=
4
Calculate the number of containerfuls needed to wipe one hectare:
Containers of liquid needed to wipe 1 ha  =
10,000 (m2)
Area wiped with 1 tank (m2)

127
7
Controlling Weeds
Example
You do a test-wipe of cover crops in a maize field, with rows 0.75 m apart. You find that you
can wipe an area of 0.75 m x 650 m with one containerful.
Area wiped with 1 containerful = 0.75 m x 650 m = 488 m2
To wipe 1 ha, you will need 10,000 / 488 = about 20 containerfuls of liquid.
The glyphosate label recommends an application rate of 3 litres of glyphosate per hec-
tare.
Amount of glyphosate per container = 3 x 1000 / 20 tanks = 150 ml
You will need to put 150 ml of glyphosate into each Zamwipe container.
5
Check the label of the herbicide you want to use. What is the recommended
application rate?
6
Calculate how much herbicide to add to each containerful to get the right
application rate:
Sprayer
You can use the same approach to make sure you use the right amount of
herbicide in a sprayer.
1
Fill the sprayer tank with clean water (do not add herbicide).
2
Spray a field until the tank is empty. Walk at the same speed as if you were
spraying weeds in a field, moving the nozzle for side to side as you nor-
mally do.
3
Calculate the area you have sprayed, the number of tankfuls needed per
hectare, and the amount of herbicide to add to each thankful, using the
equations above.
Example
In your test-spray, you use a tankful of water to spray an area 20 m x 100 m. The herbicide
label recommends an application rate of 3 litres per hectare.
Area sprayed with 1 tankful = 20 m x 100 m = 2000 m2
To spray 1 ha, you will need 10,000 / 2000 = 5 tankfuls
Amount of herbicide per tank = 3 x 1000 / 5 tanks = 600 ml
You should put 600 ml of the herbicide in each sprayer tank.

Hand-pulled or animal-drawn sprayers
You can use a similar method to the one above to work out how much herbi-
cide to apply using a hand-pulled or animal-drawn sprayer.
During your test run, make sure that the sprayer boom is set to the right height
so the sprays overlap with no wastage of liquid. Pull the sprayer (or lead the
animals) at the same speed as you would when normally spraying.
Using herbicides correctly and safely
Using herbicides correctly
Check the amount of herbicide the sprayer applies to make sure you are
using the right amount (see text above).
Spray from the right height. This depends on the height of the weeds and
the type of nozzle. If you are using a hand-pulled or animal-drawn sprayer,
adjust the height of the boom so the spray from the nozzles covers the
weeds evenly – not too much overlap, and no gaps.
Mix the herbicide with clean drinking water.
Always read the label carefully before using any herbicide.
Make sure you know how to use the herbicide properly. Get training if you
need it. If you are not sure about any herbicide or equipment, ask a special-
ist for help.
Some dealers sell fake or outdated herbicides. Buy only from a certified
dealer. Check the date on the label to make sure the herbicide you buy is
still effective.
Do not use the same herbicide year after year, because weeds may become
resistant to it. Switch herbicides each year or every few years.
Using herbicides safely
Use protective clothing to protect yourself from harmful effects of the her-
bicides.

Controlling Weeds
Weed control in Laikipia
Farmers who practise conservation agriculture in Laikipia district, a semi-arid area in
Kenya, use herbicide to control weeds.
Immediately after harvest, when the soil is not too hard and dry, they rip their fields using
an animal-drawn ripper. This allows dew and the first rains to sink into the soil.
It also allows weeds to grow. So the farmers check which type of weeds have germinated,
then buy a herbicide that will kill these weeds. In the short rainy season, broadleaved
weeds are normally more common, so the farmers buy 2,4-D herbicide (a very toxic
chemical!). In the long rains they buy Roundup (a herbicide that contains glyphosate),
which controls grass weeds.
They check on weeds regularly and apply another round of herbicide after the crop has
started to grow.
The farmers save on herbicide by spraying early in the season when the weeds are
small, and by spraying early in the morning. They need only 400–800 ml per acre.
They have found the number of weeds has fallen since they introduced conservation
agriculture in 2000. Farmers who cannot buy herbicide use an animal-drawn cultivator,
ridger or plough for the first weeding.
Wash your hands, face, body and equipment immediately after handling
or using any herbicide.
Rinse and clean spray equipment well away from water sources such as
wells, ponds or rivers.
Always store herbicides in their original containers, well out of reach of
children and animals.
Dispose of containers in a deep pit, or as indicated by the manufacturer.
Care of sprayers
Ensure that the equipment is in good working condition (no leaks or block-
ages). Check that the valves and switches are working properly and that
the spray nozzles and filters are not worn or clogged. Replace worn-out or
defective parts.
Clean the equipment immediately after use.
Grease and oil moving parts.
Tighten loose bolts and nuts.

How a Tanzanian farmer controls weeds
“When I was practising traditional agriculture, I had to hand-hoe intensively twice, and do
one lighter weeding. It took three labourers 6 or 7 days to weed one acre under normal
conditions, or 10 days if the soil was wet.
When I switched to conservation agriculture, I was able to reduce the workload and save
time and money. It took fewer people and less time to do the weeding.
The first season when I started conservation agriculture, I had to spend extra on lablab
seed and Roundup herbicide. But in the following seasons and years, the costs went
down because I had to weed less. I left half of the residues from the previous crop on the
field to cover the soil. So the work was easier: only one person could weed an acre in just
2 days by pulling the weeds.
This has given me more time for other work, such as planting trees, gardening, control-
ling erosion, and making honey. I have three beehives, which produce enough honey for
my family and to sell.”
Thomas Loronyo, Ngorbob village, Arusha
Controlling Striga with agroforestry
Striga hermonthica is a weed that attaches itself to the roots of maize and sorghum
plants. It is a parasite – like a flea or leech. It takes nutrients away from the maize or
sorghum plant, and reduces the crop yields. It is especially a problem on infertile soils.
Striga is a serious problem in parts of western Kenya. An ICRAF project in this area
promotes crop rotation as part of conservation agriculture. It recommends planting legu-
minous shrubs in rotation with the main crop. These shrubs include Crotalaria grahamiana,
Crotalaria paulina, Tephrosia candida, Tephrosia vogelii, and Sesbania sesban.
The shrubs encourage Striga seeds to germinate, but the Striga plants cannot attach
themselves to the shrub roots, so they soon die. They can completely remove Striga from
a field after only two years of rotations.
The shrubs have other benefits too. Because they are legumes, they improve the soil
fertility and raise the yield of the main crop. They also provide soil cover, reduce runoff, and
control erosion.

Conserving soil
and water

132
Conservation Agriculture
E
ROSION AND lack of rainfall are problems that many African farmers face.
Conservation agriculture can help overcome both by conserving soil and
by storing water in the soil. If erosion is severe, you can combine conservation
agriculture with other techniques to control erosion. In drier areas, you can
combine it with water-harvesting methods to make more water available to
the crop.
This chapter describes various erosion control and water management meth-
ods that you can combine with conservation agriculture. It does not describe
these approaches in detail. You can find this information in many other manu-
als (see, for example, Critchley et al., 1991 – full details in the Resource materi-
als section in Chapter 14)
Measures that control erosion and conserve soil almost always help to con-
serve water too. And techniques designed to conserve water may help reduce
soil erosion. Choose from the techniques below, and combine and adapt them
to suit your needs.
Soil conservation techniques
Erosion can be a severe problem in conventional farming, especially on steep
slopes. Conservation agriculture helps control erosion in several ways:
Protective cover
Cover crops and mulch on the surface protect the soil
against heavy rain. They prevent rainsplash from dislodging fine particles
and from forming a surface crust.
Soil structure
Undisturbed by ploughing, the soil structure stays intact.
Organic matter holds the soil particles together, making it harder for water
to carry them off, or for wind to blow them away. Roots bind the soil and
hold it in place.
Less runoff
More water sinks into the soil through cracks and pores, so
less runs off and causes erosion. Ripping and planting along the contour
helps prevent runoff. So does using planting basins, which collect water
and allow it to sink in.
If your field is on a steep slope or is badly eroded, you should not expect con-
servation agriculture, on its own, to remedy the situation quickly. You will
have to take special measures to prevent erosion before starting conservation
agriculture. These measures may include:
Contour and cutoff ditches
Gully treatment
Grass strips
Stone lines
Level contour bunds
Fanya juu terraces
Bench terraces.

8 Conserving Soil and Water
You should start by stabilizing gullies and digging cutoff drains to prevent
runoff from upslope from washing your soil away. Then, beginning at the top
of the slope, mark out contour lines running across the slope. You can use an
A-frame, line-level or water-tube level to do this. Establish grass strips (or
trash lines, or whatever other form of bunds or terraces you have chosen)
along the contour lines.
Building terraces takes a lot of work and can be expensive. Terraces can be
hard to maintain. So it may be better to choose a simpler, cheaper option such
as grass strips and stone lines.
If your land already has terraces, bunds or other erosion-control structures,
you can practise conservation agriculture on the terraces or the land between
the bunds. Plant crops using no-till methods (Chapter 3), keep the soil cov-
ered with cover crops or crop residues (Chapter 5), and rotate crops from
season to season (Chapter 6). Make sure you maintain the terraces, and keep
other structures in good repair.
Contour and cutoff ditches
A contour ditch is a ditch dug along the contour to stop water from running
down the slope and causing erosion. Water stays in the ditch and gradually
sinks into the soil. Contour ditches are useful to harvest water in dry areas.
A cutoff ditch is like a contour ditch but has a slight slope (about 1%), so
water drains slowly away. Cutoff ditches are useful to protect fields from un-
controlled runoff and to divert water away from gullies.
If your field is on an eroded hillside, dig a contour ditch or cutoff ditch at the
top end first to protect it. You can then start using conservation agriculture on
the field.
Soil and water conservation techniques that are difficult to
combine with conservation agriculture
Some commonly used soil and water conservation techniques are difficult to combine
with conservation agriculture because they involve disturbing the soil or removing the soil
cover. Here are some of them:
Trash lines (laying stalks and other crop residues in lines along the contour to slow
down erosion). This leaves the rest of the soil bare.
Contour ploughing (ploughing along the contour). This aims to reduce runoff – but it
means disturbing the soil and removing the soil cover.
Tied ridges and tied furrows. These are semipermanent ridges along the contour,
with short cross-ties to prevent water from flowing along the furrows between the
ridges. In tied ridges, the crops are planted on the ridges; in tied furrows, they are
planted in the furrows. These techniques also involve disturbing the soil. The ridges
interfere with planters and other conservation agriculture equipment.

How to set your A-frame to measure a slope
You want to dig a cutoff drain with a slope of 1%. How do you know where to dig it?
Simple: use your A-frame. You can mark the A-frame so it shows a slope of 1%. Here’s
how.
1
Cut a small block of wood 2 cm thick.
2
Put it on a level piece of ground, then put one end of a straight, 2 m long board or pole
on top of it, so the other end of the board rests on the ground.
3
Stand the A-frame on the board, and mark where the string touches the crossbar of
the A-frame. This mark shows a slope of 1% (2 cm is 1% of 2 m).
4
You can now use the A-frame to mark out a 1% slope in the field. Position the legs of
the A-frame so the string touches the mark you have made.
You can also use a line-level or a water-tube level to measure slopes as well as contours.
A-frames for different gradients
If you want the A-frame to mark a different slope, you can use blocks of wood of different
thickness:

Conserving Soil and Water
Put cross-ties in contour and cutoff ditches to slow the flow of water and to
encourage the water to sink into the ground. Plant grasses to protect the sides
of the ditch from erosion and to provide fodder for livestock.
Gully treatment
To control a gully, you must first stop water from flowing into it. Dig a cutoff
ditch above the head of the gully to divert water safely away. Then build check-
dams from rocks or wooden stakes across the gully floor to slow down any
water that still flows down the gully and to encourage sedimentation. Plant
trees and grass in the gully and on its sides to stabilize them.
Vegetative strips
A vegetative strip is a strip planted
with grass, shrubs or trees that runs
across the slope. It slows down water
flowing down the slope, and catches
sediment that has been eroded uphill.
Over time, soil may build up behind
the strip, forming a terrace.
Vegetative strips are cheap and easy
to establish. Once they are growing,
they are easy to maintain, and they can
provide valuable fodder for animals.
You can practise conservation agricul-
ture on the land between the strips.
You can cut mulch from the strips and
use it to cover the land in between.
Mark out contours with an A-frame, line-level or water-tube level. If your field
has stones, you can lay these along the contours as an additional barrier. Then
plant the strips with grass and (if you want) trees. Here are some options:
If you need fodder for your livestock, plant grasses such as Napier grass
(elephant grass, Pennisetum purpureum). Do not allow animals to graze the
strips; instead, cut grass and carry it to the animals. Caution: Napier grass
can compete with the crop growing next to it, so keep it under control.
Makarikari grass (Panicum coloratum mararikariense) is a popular grass for
barrier strips in East Africa. It is quite drought resistant and can be fed to
livestock in the dry season.
Vetiver grass (Vetiver zizanioides) forms a dense hedge and grows well
even if it is cut for fodder.
Cash crops such as pumpkins and melons may also be grown in vegeta-
tive strips.
Fodder production on vegetative strips

136
Conservation Agriculture
An alternative to grass is a hedgerow of leguminous trees such as gliri-
cidia and leucaena. You can feed the leaves to livestock, or prune the trees
and spread the branches on the ground as mulch.
One option is to allow natural vegetation to grow in the strips. Make sure
that you control weeds in these strips.
One problem with vegetative strips is that they can create alternating bands of
fertile and infertile soil. Rich sediment builds up just behind the barrier, so
crop yields here are good. Further back from the barrier, though, yields are
poorer because the topsoil here has been eroded. These bands may last for
some time, until the land between the strips is levelled. Conservation agricul-
ture can help to prevent such bands from developing.
Stone lines
Stone lines are common throughout Africa, in both dry and humid areas. They
are used wherever there are loose stones in the field. In the Sahel (especially
Burkina Faso and Niger), they are small – at most three stones wide, and one
or two high. They slow down runoff, and soil gradually builds up behind them.
The distance between the lines depends on the slope and how many stones are
available. On 2–5% slopes they are often 25–50 m apart.
You can make stone lines from stones in your field, though some farmers bring
them in by donkey cart or lorry from up to 10 km away. Line them up along
the contour, and plant grass or trees on either side.
Planting pits are often used in combination with stone lines. This is a tradi-
tional form of conservation agriculture.

Conserving Soil and Water
Contour ridges
Contour ridges
Contour ridges are ridges of soil that run along the contour. Like other con-
tour barriers, they slow down water flow and catch sediment before it is washed
away.
You can make small ridges (called “cross-ties”) at right angles to the contour
to make the contour ridges more effective at trapping water. These cross-ties
prevent the water from flowing along behind the contour ridge and collecting
at the lowest point – where it may break through the ridge and start a gully.
Space the cross-ties 10 m apart (closer on steeper slopes and in areas with
heavy rainfall).
Fanya juu terraces
Fanya juu terraces are made by digging a drainage channel and throwing the
soil uphill to make a ridge (fanya juu means “throw soil uphill” in Swahili). The
channel is usually 50–60 cm deep and may have cross-ties at 10 m intervals.
Grass planted on the ridges helps stabilize the ridges, prevents erosion, and
can be used to feed livestock or as mulch.
In drier areas, fanya juu terraces may be built along the contour, and trees
planted in the ditches.
In high-rainfall areas, it may be better to build them with a slight gradient so
the water drains slowly away. Trees can be planted on the banks.

Fanya juu terraces in Makanya
Farmers in Makanya, a dry, hilly area in northeastern Tanzania, use fanya juu terraces to
conserve water and control erosion. They use a line-level to mark contours in their fields,
then dig trenches 50 cm wide and 60 cm along the contours. They pile the earth in ridges
upslope of the trenches, and plant fodder grass on the ridges.
They grow maize on the land between the trenches. They used to harvest less than 1.5 t/
ha using conventional ploughing. But when they used an animal-drawn Magoye ripper,
the yield rose to 2.4 t/ha. Applying manure and planting dolichos as a cover crop raised it
still more, to 3.6 t/ha.
Bench terraces
Bench terraces are usually found on medium to steep slopes. They consist of
beds which are more or less level, and risers (walls or bunds). It is easy to grow
crops on the beds because they are fairly level.
Bench terraces can be made by moving soil from one place to another on the
slope. Moving large amounts of soil takes a lot of work: 1500 person days or
more to terrace a single hectare on a steep slope. To make this worthwhile,
bench terraces must produce much higher yields than before. This is not al-
ways the case, so building new bench terraces is going out of fashion. If you do
want to build bench terraces in a field, you should do so before starting con-
servation agriculture.

Conserving Soil and Water
Bench terraces may also develop gradually as soil builds up behind a vegeta-
tive strip, contour bund or stone line.
To be effective, bench terraces must be well maintained. Keep the risers planted
with grass, and repair them if necessary. Use conservation agriculture on the
beds to conserve the soil, encourage water to sink in, and maintain fertility.
Water harvesting and conservation
In areas with poor rainfall, there may not be enough water to grow crops
reliably. But even in dry years in these areas, more than half the precious rain-
water may be lost through evaporation or because it runs off. Conservation
agriculture helps conserve water and use it efficiently in at least five ways:
More water in the soil
Crop residue or a cover crop protects the soil,
prevents crusting on the surface, and slows runoff. Roots, earthworms and
other soil life maintain cracks and pores in the soil. Less water runs off,
and more sinks into the soil. Ripped furrows and planting basins collect
and store water.
Less evaporation
Reduced or no tillage means the soil is not turned and
does not dry out. The cover protects the soil from wind and direct sun (you
can often feel the temperature difference with your hand). Because there is
no hardpan, water can sink deeper into the soil.
Better use of season’s rainfall
Ripping during the dry season allows farm-
ers to plant earlier – right at the start of the rains.
Bench terraces

Conservation Agriculture
More crop per drop
Over the last two decades, smallholder farmers in Babati District, Tanzania, have adopted
conservation agriculture. Instead of disc ploughs, they now use animal- and tractor-
drawn rippers and subsoilers. Their yields have more than doubled since the mid-1980s.
That means farmers get more crop for every drop of rain: an extra millimetre of rain now
produces as much as 4 kg more grain per hectare. Before, each millimetre produced only
1.5 kg of grain.
It is easy to see – or rather, to feel – the effects of conservation agriculture. Several weeks
after the last rains, the soil in ploughed fields is hard and dry. On conservation agriculture
fields, however, the soil is still soft and moist. Even after a prolonged dry spell, the crops
are still vigorous and do not show signs of water stress.
Roots can reach more water
Breaking the hardpan with a subsoiler al-
lows roots to reach water deeper in the soil.
Water concentrates in planting lines or pits
Rainwater collects in ripped
planting lines or planting basins, where it sinks into the soil – just where
the crop needs it.
In wetter areas, conservation agriculture can also help manage water. It can
reduce runoff and erosion, make springs run more steadily, and reduce pollu-
tion in rivers.
Conservation agriculture helps conserve water, but it may not be enough in
dry areas. You can use various other techniques to harvest extra water, either
in the field itself, or by bringing water in from outside to where the crops are
growing.
Techniques to manage water include:
Broad beds and furrows
Planting basins or pitting
Permanent strips
Contour bunds and catchment strips
Bunds and runoff strips
Road catchments
Half-moon microcatchments
One word of caution: cover crops also use water. In dry areas, you should
consider using other types of mulch, such as crop residues or plant remains
brought in from outside the field. That will help conserve moisture in the soil
where it can be used by the crop.

141
8 Conserving Soil and Water
Broadbeds and furrows
Broadbeds are flat beds about 1–1.2 m wide, separated by furrows. The width
of the broadbeds and furrows depends on the crops grown. In areas prone to
waterlogging, the furrows drain water away from the beds. In drier areas,
they can be used to bring water harvested elsewhere into the field.
Crops such as maize can be grown on the broadbeds, while rice can be planted
in the furrows. It is necessary to make the beds only once, before starting con-
servation agriculture. Afterwards, plant the seeds directly on the beds through
the soil cover without tilling, using the techniques described in Chapter 3.
Planting basins or pits
Planting basins (see Chapter 3) collect water and give it time to sink into the
soil. Stagger the rows, so basins in one row catch the water that does not fall
into basins in the row upslope. Add manure or compost to the basins to im-
prove the soil fertility.
Planting pits (known as zai in Burkina Faso and tassa in Niger) are a variation
on the idea of planting basins. They are hand-dug circular holes which collect
water and store it for use by the crop. Each pit is about 20 cm across and 20 cm
deep. After planting, the holes are left partly open so they collect water.
Planting pits take a lot of work to dig when the soil is dry. But they produce
good yields in areas where otherwise crops might die because of a lack of
water.
Once made, the pits can be used again, season after season. Leave the soil
covered, and add compost or fertilizer to the pits to increase their fertility.

Conservation Agriculture
Contour bunds and catchment strips
In areas with low rainfall, there may not be enough water to grow a crop over
the whole area. On gentle slopes (less than 3%), one possibility is to use con-
tour bunds and catchment strips. Catchment strips are areas where no crops
are planted. When rain falls on this ground, it flows downslope and is trapped
by the contour bund. Plant rows of crops behind the bund to use this water.
This can produce a good yield even with very little rain.
Mulch the cultivated area with crop residues to prevent erosion, help water
sink in, and slow evaporation. Plant crops using conservation agriculture prac-
tices such as ripping, pitting or direct planting through a soil cover.
Road catchments
Water from roads – and from other unproductive areas such as paths and
homestead compounds – can be channelled onto fields. It may be possible to
divert water from structures that already exist, such as the ditches below fanya
juu terraces. Or special bunds can be built around fields close to the road.
Another possibility is to direct the water into a pond, which can be used to
irrigate crops.
Permanent strips in Botswana
In very low rainfall areas, it is possi-
ble to grow crops by planting them
in strips. By sloping the ground in
between towards the strips, rainwa-
ter will flow towards the strips, close
to the crop.
A farmer in Botswana makes his
cropped strips 0.8–1 m wide and
3.3 m apart. He subsoils these
strips using a tractor-powered sub-
soiler to a depth of 0.7 m. He shapes
the land between the strips so it
slopes towards the cropped strips,
so rainwater will flow towards the
crop. He plants two rows of maize
in each strip, and sows a cover crop
such as cowpea in between the strips.
The strips are permanent: they can be used to grow crops season after season. The
tractor never drives over them, so there is no risk of compaction or hardpan formation.
The soil in the strips gradually improves in fertility as crop residues accumulate there.
Rotating maize with a legume crop will improve the soil fertility further. The farmer has
been able to grow up to 6 t/ha of maize with less than 400 mm/season of rain.

Half-moon microcatchments
Half-moon microcatchments are small, semicircular earth bunds. They are quite
common on the desert margins of the Sahel, where they are called “demi-
lunes”. The half-moons catch water flowing down a slope. Crops such as sor-
ghum, millet and cowpeas can be planted in the lower portion of the half-
moons, using conservation agriculture techniques. Half-moons are helpful to
rehabilitate degraded land.
Harvesting rainwater in Kordofan
The Agricultural Research and Technology Corporation has tested contour bunds and
catchment strips in Kordofan, western Sudan, since 1998. Soils in this area are sandy or
sandy clay loams. Slopes are gentle – about 1%. Rainfall is erratic, varying from 140 to
625 mm a year in the period 1998–2002. Prolonged dry spells during the cropping sea-
son are frequent. The main crops are sorghum, millet, watermelon and groundnuts. With
the first rains the soil surface becomes crusted. The precious water runs off and is lost.
Researchers and farmers have tried using parallel earth bunds, about 40 cm high, spaced
10 m apart. The upper half of the area between the bunds serves as the catchment. Most
of the lower half is ripped and planted with sorghum, while cowpea or groundnuts and
roselle are planted in the lowest part. This simple technique can triple or quadruple
sorghum yields in normal years, and prevent total crop failure in dry years.

No-till irrigation in western Sudan
Farmers in the Khor Abu-Habil Agricultural Scheme in western Sudan grow crops using
irrigation from the Khor Abu-Habil, a seasonal stream.
The fields in this scheme cover 2 ha each. They are surrounded with earth bunds, 1 m
high. Water is diverted from the stream into a main canal, and from there through feeder
canals and the fields. The fields are flooded to a depth of 80 cm for 15 days – which
allows the water to sink 1 metre into the soil. The fields are then ready for sowing.
The farmers do not plough the soil. Instead, they direct-sow cotton, sorghum, sunflower,
tomatoes and legumes. They weed the fields by hand.
The farmers of Khor Abu-Habil could improve their production further by introducing other
aspects of conservation agriculture: a soil cover (such as cowpeas) and crop rotation or
intercropping.

Livestock

148
Conservation Agriculture
L
IVESTOCK ARE VERY important for many farmers. They provide meat, milk,
hides, and manure, and they pull farm implements and carts. Farmers
often allow their animals to graze on crop residues in fields after the harvest.
But this is a problem in conservation agriculture because of the need to keep
the soil covered. If the animals eat all the cover crops or stalks from the previ-
ous crop, the soil surface will be bare and exposed to heavy rain and to the
wind. There will be little organic matter left to enrich and protect the soil.
Heavy animals such as cattle also trample the soil and compact it, especially if
the soil is wet.
So it is best to keep animals out of the fields even when there is no crop grow-
ing. You can fence your fields to keep livestock out, or you can reach agree-
ments with neighbours who own animals about where to graze them.
But if the animals do not graze on the crop residues, what do they eat? You
and your neighbours must find other ways to feed them. You can feed them
with some of the residues from the main crop and part of the cover crop. If the
animals do not trample the cover crop, you can use more of it as feed. You can
also grow fodder in special plots.
It is quite possible to produce enough feed so that both crops and livestock
benefit from conservation agriculture.
Animals provide meat and milk to people and pull farm implements. They also produce
manure that can be used to fertilize the crop field. They can be fed with crop residues and
specially grown fodder.

Feeding animals
Here are some ways to feed livestock within conservation agriculture.
Cut-and-carry Grow fodder in the conservation agriculture field, then
cut it and carry it to the animals.
Controlled grazing If you cannot keep animals out of the field, then at
least limit the damage they do. Let them eat only part of the forage or
residues. Leave the rest to cover the soil.
Sources of feed
Cover crops
Many cover crops produce excellent
livestock forage. Legumes are rich in
protein and help animals grow fast.
See Chapter 5 for a list of cover crops.
Crop residues
The leaves, stalks and pods of legume
crops such as beans, cowpeas, pigeon-
peas and groundnuts are rich in pro-
tein. Oilseeds such as cotton, soybean
and sunflower can be used to make
feed meal. Maize and sorghum leaves
provide roughage. It is best to leave the
stalks on the field as mulch.
Check the crop and remove any bar-
ren plants, then feed them to livestock.
Grasses and legumes
You can grow legumes (such as lu-
cerne) and grasses in special fodder
plots or along contour lines, the edges
of bench terraces, and around fields.
Suitable grasses include elephant grass,
Brachiaria, Guinea grass, star grass,
Rhodes grass and Setaria.
You can also cut natural grasses,
weeds and other vegetation from field
edges and roadsides and use it as feed.

150
Conservation Agriculture
Fodder trees
Leaves and pods of trees such as gliri-
cidia and leucaena make good fodder.
They are often planted around the
fields or along contour lines to rein-
force them. They are also often grown
in rotation with maize or sorghum be-
cause they fix nitrogen.
Hay
You can make hay to use as feed when
fresh fodder is scarce (see the box on
the next page). Store hay in a dry place.
Silage
Silage is a good way of preserving fod-
der for use when other sources are
scarce. See the box on the next page
for how to make silage.
Purchased feed
You may be able to buy hay from other
farmers or feed from shops.
Mineral blocks
Animals need vitamins and small
amounts of minerals such as calcium,
iron and phosphorus. Give them these
in mineral blocks and licks. You can
make mineral blocks yourself (see the
box on page 152).

151

Livestock
Silage
Silage is a good way to preserve livestock feed. You can make silage during the rainy
season from natural grasses. Cut the grass when it is beginning to flower, about 10 cm
above the ground.
You can also make silage from cover crops or purpose-grown forage from your conser-
vation agriculture fields.
You can even make silage from your main crop of rice, maize, sorghum and millet if it
does not produce grain, or if it cannot grow on to maturity (e.g., if the rains stop). Cut the
plants when the grain is at the dough stage. Cut them about 15 cm above the ground.
How to make silage
1
Pick a good site, preferably on a slight
slope where water cannot collect.
2
Dig a pit about 3 m x 1 m, and 1.2 m
deep.
3
Spread a layer of fine sand or kaolin
clay, 20 cm thick, on the bottom of the
pit.
4
Sprinkle 500 g of salt evenly over the
bottom of the pit. Use the cheapest salt
you can find.
5
The pit is now ready for filling. You will
need about 3.5–4 tons of green grass
and other vegetation, plus 500 kg of
salt.
6
Cut the vegetation and let it wilt for about
20 minutes in the sun.
7
Put a layer of wilted vegetation in the
pit, about 10 cm deep. Sprinkle some
salt on this layer. Compact the vegeta-
tion by rolling it with a big drum filled
with water.
Making hay with a tripod
1
Make a tripod from three stakes and
some wire or string. Build it in the open,
away from shade.
2
Cut grass or lucerne and hang it over
the wires. Leave it to dry.
You can use a tripod even during the rainy
season because raindrops simply roll off
without wetting the inside.
Air circulates freely, so the hay dries with-
out any mould forming.

Conservation Agriculture
Silage (continued)
8
Add another layer of vegetation and salt,
then another and another. Roll each
layer as you add it. Sprinkle less salt on
the lower layers but gradually add more
salt on the upper layers.
9
Continue to add and compact the lay-
ers until the pit is completely filled, well
above the ground surface and in the
shape of a dome.
10 Cover the pile with a sheet of thick plas-
tic 3.5 m x 1.5 m, then put a 10 cm layer
of earth on top of the sheet. This earth
keeps the pit watertight, airtight, and
well compacted.
A group of 25 farmers can complete a silo like this in about 16 hours: 10 people to cut the
forage, 5 to carry it, and 10 to fill and compact the forage in the pit.
Inspect the silo regularly. The pile will contract gradually as the vegetation inside fer-
ments. Pile more earth on top to keep the dome shape and prevent rainwater from getting
into the pit.
The silage is ready to be fed to animals after about 3 weeks. Take enough out of the pit to
feed each day, then cover it with the plastic sheet again. The silage can be stored for 3–
4 months.
Protecting your fields
You need to protect your fields and cover crops from grazing animals through-
out the year. That means managing animals in a different way.
This is usually a sensitive issue in semi-arid areas. After the harvest, herders
often move their animals into the fields to graze on crop residues. The farmers
are usually happy about this: the animals convert the stubble into valuable
manure.
Making salt licks
When the silo is empty, you can make salt licks from the layer of clay or sand at the bottom.
1
Make a shallow, open box about 40 x 20 x 10 cm.
2
Fill the box with sand or clay from the bottom of the pit. Press it into the box so it is
compact.
3
Turn it out onto a flat surface and allow it to dry in the sun.
4
The resulting salt licks will weigh about 2.5 kg. Each silage pit can produce about 20
blocks. Livestock love them!

153
9 Livestock
But conservation agriculture means keeping the soil covered with mulch or a
cover crop, and preventing animals from trampling on and compacting the
soil.
So herders and farmers who have set aside some of their fields for conserva-
tion agriculture may come into conflict.
It may be possible for the communities to agree for the herders to graze their
animals on some fields freely, and to keep off the fields used for conservation
agriculture.
If the land is communally owned, the whole community needs to be involved
in controlling grazing.
Fencing
Fences are one way of keeping animals out of fields. There are three types:
Metal fences Wire netting or barbed wire fences are expensive but quick
to erect.
Thorn bush fences If there are dead thorn bushes nearby, you can drag
them into place.
Living fences Living fences take longer to establish than thorn bushes or
metal fences, but they also produce firewood, act as windbreaks and pro-
vide shade. The best living fences are made of species that livestock do not
browse on, such as Balanites, Ziziphus or Euphorbia, which are traditionally
used for fencing. Jatropha seeds contain oil, which farmers can use as fuel
or to make soap.
Which species of tree or shrub to use? Check the table on the next page, and
consult the local forestry department if necessary. Choose one or more species,
collect the seeds, dry them in the sun and treat them with insecticide so you
can store them until you need them. Grow the seedlings in a nursery, then
transplant them to where you want the fence.
Work animals
Various animals are used to pull farm implements: oxen, donkeys, horses,
mules, camels and water buffaloes.
Pulling equipment is hard work. Animals need to be strong and healthy.
Before using them for work, give them extra feed and treat them for worms
to build up their strength.
Prevent animals from eating crops and residues when they are working in
the fields. If necessary, put muzzles on them.
Feed them well the night before they work so they are easier to control.

154
Conservation Agriculture
Training animals
Train the animals so they get used to pulling conservation agriculture equip-
ment (subsoilers, rippers, planters, sprayers and knife rollers). Animals are
trained to follow the previous furrow line. Conservation agriculture equip-
ment uses a long yoke: a little more than twice the width of the distance
between the planting rows (see page 58).
A normal yoke used for ploughing is only about 75 cm long, so the animals
are close together and in bodily contact as they work. Changing to a long
yoke means that they no longer have this mutual support. Training them
to work with a long yoke takes 2–3 days.
Both the animals and operators need to get used to the new equipment. For
example, subsoilers have no wheels, so are harder to turn at the end of the
row.

Conservation Agriculture
A
DOPTING CONSERVATION agriculture may mean making other changes in how
you run your farm:
Your production should increase, so you will need more labour to harvest
and handle the crop, and more room to store the grain.
The soil will hold more moisture, so you may be able to grow an extra crop
in the dry season.
You may need new types of inputs: cover crop seed, herbicides, special
equipment, etc. You may need credit to buy these.
This chapter is aimed not just at farmers, but also at the people who provide
them with inputs such as seeds, equipment and fertilizer.
Harvesting
When harvesting, make sure that the crop stalks and leaves are left on the
ground as mulch. Use a machete to cut maize and other tall plants such as
sunflower at about 20 cm high, leaving the roots in the ground. Old roots in
the soil improve the soil texture and structure, and the standing stalks show
clearly where to apply herbicide and plant the next crop. Lay the cut materials
between the rows, parallel to them. Because the rows run across the slope, the
mulch will help prevent erosion.
Alternatively, you can use a combine-harvester with a spreader attachment to
distribute the stalks evenly over the ground.
When cleaning or processing the harvest, use the waste to make compost, or
put it back on the soil as mulch.
Higher yields from conservation agriculture means you may need a bigger grain store!

Storage
Dry grain thoroughly before storing or
processing it. It should have less than
12.5% moisture content. This helps
prevent damage by pests and diseases
during storage.
If you live in a humid area, you may
have to use a drier. Consider having
your grain dried by a commercial
grain drier. Or it may be worthwhile
buying or making a drier yourself, per-
haps along with some neighbours.
Make sure the grain is clean before storing it.
Grain stores on farm are best made of brick and cement, with few openings so
that pests cannot get in. They must be weatherproof: the roof must protect the
grain from rain and sun and keep the grain dry and cool. Channel rainwater
away from the store to keep it dry.
Use an approved insecticide to protect the grain from insects. You can mix the
insecticide into the grain by hand, with an auger or in a cement mixer. Or you
can spray it onto the grain and then mix it in. If you use a spray, dry the grain
before storing it for a long time.
If you store grain in jute or woven plastic bags, treat it first with an insecticide.
Rats and mice can be a big problem. They eat the grain and damage it with
their urine. It is vital to keep them away from the store: put wire mesh over
openings, and fix metal cones on the legs of grain cribs to keep them out. Use
treated bait in the store. Cats and owls also help control rats and mice.
Processing and marketing
If you grow vegetables or other per-
ishable crops, plan to get them to mar-
ket quickly so they are fresh and fetch
a good price.
Consider forming a marketing coop-
erative with your neighbours so you
can sell a large amount of produce to-
gether. That should give you a better
price, and will help cut transport costs.
Also consider options such as contract
growing to guarantee a market for
your produce.

Inputs
The main inputs that farmers need for conservation agriculture are:
Information
Equipment
Seed
Fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides
Credit.
We will discuss each of these in turn.
Information
Farmers (and extension staff) need various types of information:
Services Where to get services, who can provide what?
Marketing Demand for produce, prices. This will influence what crops
they grow.
Technology How to grow a particular crop, how to overcome problems
in the field.
They can get this information from various sources: radio, extension agencies,
leaflets, research institutes, successful commercial growers, farmer associations,
local dealers, manufacturers and input suppliers. Events such as on-farm field
days are crucial to bring together the various groups and enable them to share
information. See Chapter 13 for more information.

10 Harvesting, Marketing and Input Supplies
Equipment
Most small-scale farmers have (or can
borrow) hoes, planting and weeding
implements, and knapsack sprayers. It
may be possible to borrow or hire other
equipment rather than buying it your-
self. An implement should last for sev-
eral years, so it may be worth invest-
ing in it even though it looks expen-
sive.
The table on the next page summarizes
what equipment you may need when.
See the other sections in this manual
for details on the various types of
equipment.
Seed
It is important to plant good-quality seed. This will ensure:
A high germination rate (more than 90% of the seeds should sprout).
There are no seeds of weeds or of other crop varieties mixed in.
You can make sure of this by buying only certified seed.
You can also grow your own seed. This is a specialized business, but it can be
very profitable. In areas where a lot of farmers are adopting conservation ag-
riculture, there may be a good market for seed of cover crops such as pigeon-
pea, lablab and mucuna.
You may also be able to get seed from other farmers, seed suppliers, NGOs or
research institutions.
Fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides
You can use the same fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides in conservation ag-
riculture as in conventional farming.
Once your conservation agriculture fields are well established, you will prob-
ably need to use less inorganic fertilizer and herbicides. This is because the soil
will be more fertile, and cover crops will suppress weeds.
Try to use integrated pest management to control pests and diseases. How-
ever, you may find you have to use pesticides to control pests in the cover
crops and mulch.
Be careful when handling pesticides. Read the label carefully, and make sure
you use them safely.

Conservation Agriculture
Credit
Small-scale farmers find it difficult to get credit for their farm operations. Few
banks have branches in rural areas. And banks require collateral (usually in
the form of land title deeds – which few farmers have) in order to extend
credit. But there are ways around this.
Farmer associations
Groups of farmers have stronger credibility than an in-
dividual, and can overcome the problem of collateral to get credit. Banks can
extend a loan to the association, which then lends on to its individual mem-
bers. The burden of recovering loans from individual members lies with the
association, and not with the bank. If someone fails to repay a loan, the bank
can disqualify the whole association. This puts pressure on other members to
make sure the defaulting person pays up.
Village banks
Village banks are where farmers group together and pool their
savings into a common account. Individual members can then get loans from
this account if they want to buy inputs. Group members agree on the condi-
tions for borrowing. The money saved can be invested in small-scale businesses,
deposited with a larger bank, or lent to non-members at a higher interest rate.

Microfinance eases access to inputs
After seeing demonstrations and trying out the new techniques, farmers in Kalama Divi-
sion in Kenya were enthusiastic about conservation agriculture. But they couldn’t afford to
buy the equipment and inputs they needed. So the Kenya Network for Draught Animal
Technology (KENDAT), the NGO promoting conservation agriculture, helped them organ-
ize themselves into credit groups and to operate their own village bank.
The credit groups were formed from the clubs which had been involved in trying out
conservation agriculture techniques and running on-farm demonstrations. Each group
set its own rules, decided on its own constitution and elected its own leaders. Seven
such groups were formed. They registered with the government authorities and opened
a bank account, with the group representatives as signatories.
The chair and treasurer or secretary of each group attended training in group dynamics
and on establishing and managing a revolving fund. Group members deposit a small
amount of savings into the account on a regular basis. KENDAT added funds to the
account to help the funds grow. The NGO remains a cosignatory for the account.
The group processes applications for loans, and all loan repayments are deposited
directly into the account. The members decided on vital details such as interest rates,
fines, repayment periods and how to recover unpaid loans. Loan recovery rates are a
remarkable 100%. Many farmers are anxious to repay their loans so they can borrow
more for the following season.
The original intention was to help farmers borrow money to buy rippers, subsoilers and
other conservation agriculture implements. But the farmers wanted to invest in things
that would give them quicker returns. For example, they chose to buy fertilizer and hybrid
seed rather than a ripper, to start with. Some also used their loans to invest in small
businesses, and then to use their profits to buy equipment for conservation agriculture.
More information: Pascal Kaumbutho, KENDAT
Collateral or loan security
Prices for grain typically fall very low just after
harvest time, when many farmers want to sell at the same time. Farmers can
get around this problem by delivering their grain to a private warehouse, which
issues a receipt. When the grain prices rise, the farmer can sell the grain, or
can choose to keep it in storage in the hope of a better price. The farmer can
also use this stored grain as collateral for a loan to buy inputs for the next crop.
Contract outgrower schemes
Processors of farm produce often sign contracts
with farmers to grow produce for them. The processor may provide some or
all of the inputs needed, as well as extension advice and services such as spraying
and harvesting. The farmer gets a guaranteed price for the produce. Small-
scale farmers can join one of these schemes to finance their crop production.
Such schemes are popular for commercial crops such as cotton and paprika.
Other sources of credit
It may be possible to get credit from various other
sources: through the manufacturer or dealer, a government loan scheme or a
development project.
If it is possible to pay back the loan over several seasons, farmers or small
groups can buy equipment without having to invest too much money at one
time.

The warehouse receipt system in Zambia
Zambian farmers are faced with the problem of marketing of their produce. Poor storage
facilities mean they cannot keep their produce until prices are good. So they are forced to
sell at very low prices.
Some privately owned warehouses implement a system called “warehouse receipt”.
This system is controlled and promoted by the Zambia Agriculture Commodity Agency,
which certifies the warehouses and ensures they are properly managed.
Farmers transport their crop to the warehouse, and they are given a receipt.
The warehouse gives the farmer an advance payment based on the total value of the crop
at that time. This advance payment is usually about 50–70% of the current value of the
crop.
When the market prices go up, the warehouse sells the produce. It deducts the advance
and the cost of storage, and pays the balance to the farmer.
This system has several advantages:
The farmer can choose when to sell the crop, or the warehouse will advise him or her
when the price is right.
The warehouse is responsible for storing the crop and maintaining its quality.
The farmer can use the receipt as collateral to obtain a bank loan.
In 2003/4, farmers practising conservation agriculture in Choma District in southern Zambia
stored about 300 tonnes of grain using this system. Their crop was sold after 7 months,
when the prices were high, and in time for farmers to buy inputs for the coming season.
Farmers like this system because they can sell their crop when they want, and can get a
loan so they can invest in other businesses. Some have even started earning money by
buying produce from other farmers and putting it in the warehouse.

Obtaining inputs
Farmers need to have easy access to seed, fertilizers and other inputs if they
are to adopt conservation agriculture. It is a challenge is to get the necessary
inputs to remote areas. Businesspeople are reluctant to transport small amounts
of inputs long distances over bad roads: it is too expensive and risky. Here are
some ways to overcome this problem.
Linking suppliers and farmers
Extension officers should form links between farmers and suppliers. They can
help farmers find out what is available, and suppliers know what farmers
need. Field days and agricultural shows are good ways to bring farmers and
suppliers together so they can learn from each other.

165

Harvesting, Marketing and Input Supplies
Local dealerships and agents
There are a number of advantages in establishing local dealerships. They re-
duce the distance farmers have to travel to obtain inputs. A well-stocked local
dealer will save the farmer a lot of time and expense by providing a wide
range of inputs. The dealer can also extend credit for inputs to farmers. He or
she should have a good working knowledge of each product sold, so will be
able to provide excellent customer service.
Dealers will have to stock new types of inputs, such as:
Herbicides and other chemicals.
Cover crop seeds.
Hand tools such as jab-planters and weed wipers.
Animal-drawn equipment such as rippers and subsoilers.
Spare parts for equipment.
Farmer groups
Farmers groups can buy equipment for their members to share – and to hire
out to non-members. As farmers’ incomes rise and the area planted to conser-
vation agriculture increases, the group can buy extra equipment. It can also
buy seed and fertilizer in bulk, so cutting costs and saving on transport.
Equipment hire services
Individual smallholders cannot afford expensive, sophisticated equipment such
as heavy-duty rippers or tractor-drawn spray rigs and planters. But they may
be able to hire it – if there is a hire service nearby.
This is a potentially profitable business opportunity for entrepreneurs or groups
of people. Projects or extension services might consider helping them set up
such a business. In Ghana, for example, young men have formed contract
spraying and planting teams. They hire themselves out to farmers to apply
pesticide and fertilizer and to do planting. The farmers supply the inputs needed.
Benefit from better-off farmers
If you cannot afford to buy equipment yourself, perhaps a better-off neigh-
bour would be interested in investing in it, then hiring it out?
If large-scale commercial farmers nearby adopt conservation agriculture, in-
puts may become available for small-scale farmers too. If a few large-scale
farms demand certain types of inputs, suppliers may find it profitable to open
a local depot. Small-scale farmers can then buy inputs and get information
from the same depot.

166
Conservation Agriculture
Learning how to make rippers and subsoilers
Many farmers would like to use conservation agriculture, but they can’t. They don’t have
the right equipment, and they can’t buy it anywhere.
The solution? Teach local artisans to make the equipment.
Farmers in Kalama Division, Machakos District, Kenya, and in Arumeru in Tanzania,
learned how to use direct planting and cover crops. But they still had a problem with
hardpans. And they couldn’t buy or hire subsoilers to break the hardpans.
The Maendeleo Agricultural Technology Fund, a KENDAT project supported by FARM Af-
rica, trained local artisans how to make the equipment. Before the training, artisans
attended field days and demonstrations so they were familiar with the equipment, the
principles of conservation agriculture and the needs of farmers.
They then attended two training courses. The first was held at Nandra Engineering in
Moshi, Tanzania. It covered basic workshop procedures, safety measures, materials
selection and costing, basic workshop skills (cutting, bending, measurements, etc.), and
the use of jigs and fixtures for accurate, consistent reproduction of tools and parts. Each
of the participants made a prototype subsoiler to take home.
The same artisans then attended another course, this time closer to home, at Ekima
Engineering in Machakos. It reviewed the production process, and in particular the use of
jigs and fixtures. Each participant was given a set of the jigs and fixtures needed to make
rippers and subsoilers. The project then placed an order of five subsoilers and five
rippers with each of the artisans to get them started. It also arranged for credit so they
could buy materials for big orders.
Buying materials remains a problem: some can be found only in Nairobi, some 100 km
away. The cost of transport adds to the sale price of the equipment, and makes small
orders uneconomical.
Links with farmers are critical. If they are to buy conservation agriculture equipment,
farmers have to know where to get it. The same is true if they need it repaired.
More information: Joseph Mutua, KENDAT
Local manufacture and repair of implements
Africa must import most of its conservation agriculture equipment, mainly
from Brazil. This is expensive, takes time, and restricts the amount and type of
equipment that farmers can buy.
Equipment such as rippers, subsoilers and planters can be made more easily
available if local artisans and blacksmiths are trained to make it. Farmers can
then buy the equipment cheaply, instead of waiting for hard-to-find, expen-
sive imports. Artisans can also repair equipment that is damaged or worn out.
Locally made equipment has to be good quality. It must use the right materials
(such as quality steel) and be made with precision. If implements do not work
properly, no one will buy them.

Equipment manufacture in Zimbabwe
A workshop in Zimbabwe highlighted the need for conservation agriculture equipment for
smallholder farmers. A representative of a local equipment manufacturer attended the
workshop, and the firm started producing ripper-planters soon afterwards.
The firm procured a prototype from South Africa and modified it to suit Zimbabwean
conditions. It conducted on-farm trials with the help of NGOs and extension organiza-
tions. The planter is now available commercially.
Small packs for small farms
CropLife, an industry association, is encouraging firms to make things easy for small-
scale farmers. Among its recommendations:
Supply inputs in small packs.
Make packs the right size for specific needs – for example, a 2.5 kg bag of maize seed
is enough to plant 1000 m2; one sachet or bottle of insecticide for a 15 litre knapsack
sprayer.
Print labels in the local language.
List problem pests, weeds and diseases on the labels, with the local names.
Provide local-language brochures, pamphlets and video presentations.
Mixing a small pack is easy: no measuring equipment is needed, and some packs have
markings on the container. Application is accurate, reducing the misuse of products. A
farmer can mix and spray a small pack of herbicide quickly: a single knapsack of insecti-
cide takes 15–20 minutes to spray out. Storing and disposing of small packs is easy.
More information: Jim Findlay
Appropriate packaging
Seeds, fertilizers and other agrochemicals often come in large packs, designed
for commercial, large-scale growers. But these large packs are not ideal for
smaller scale farmers. Retailers can re-bag these inputs into smaller packages
better suited for smaller farms. For example, seeds packed in 1 kg, 2.5 kg and 5
kg bags could be sold in local dealer shops, supermarkets and garages in rural
areas. The small packs are lighter, affordable, easier to carry and can be planted
in a short period. Seed firms in Kenya and Zimbabwe have tried this approach
and found it is very successful.

Conservation Agriculture
S
O SHOULD YOU adopt conservation agriculture? Is it likely to be profitable?
This chapter shows you how to work out whether conservation agriculture
will be worthwhile for you.
Some questions to ask:
How can conservation agriculture benefit me?
How does conservation agriculture benefit other people?
How much yield does conservation agriculture produce?
How much does conservation agriculture cost?
Is conservation agriculture profitable?
Is conservation agriculture worthwhile?
How much work is conservation agriculture?
When is work needed for conservation agriculture?
This chapter deals with each of these questions in turn. For many of these
questions, it gives a simple way of working out the answers using your own
farming experience. Check also Chapter 2, Converting to conservation agricul-
ture, for more ideas to help you make the right choice.
How can conservation agriculture
benefit me?
Conservation agriculture has many benefits. Here are some of them:
Your soil will become more fertile. It will be richer in organic matter, and
more earthworms and other soil life. That means healthy crops and higher
yields.
A more fertile soil also means money saved on fertilizer.
The soil should hold more water, so is less likely to dry out quickly. That
means better yields in dry years, more reliable springs, and wells that do
not dry out.
The soil cover reduce erosion, preserving the soil for the future. This may
seem like a long-term benefit, but many farmers see the value of it in terms
of higher yields in only a few years.
A healthier crop should mean less pesticide use, meaning a cleaner envi-
ronment and safer drinking water.
Fewer weeds mean less weeding and money saved on herbicides.
You should have more free time that you can use in other ways. Running
a business, for example, trading, keeping animals, or making honey.
Your fields may produce new products that you can use yourself or sell.
Examples are cover crop seeds, firewood or forage.

171
11
Should You Adopt Conservation Agriculture?
Some of these benefits are reflected in higher yields and lower costs. Others
are harder to measure in money terms: how much is clean drinking water
worth, for example?
How does conservation agriculture
benefit other people?
If you adopt conservation agriculture, you will gain in many ways. So will
other people in your community and elsewhere. Everyone benefits from cleaner
water and reduced erosion. If many farmers take up conservation agriculture,
the benefits can be considerable for society as a whole.
Less erosion means less soil carried away into rivers. Cleaner rivers mean
better water quality for people living downstream. Less silt clogs irrigation
canals and reservoirs. That means irrigation schemes work better and are
cheaper to maintain, and reservoirs have a longer life.
More organic matter holds carbon in the soil rather letting it disappear into
the air as carbon dioxide. Large amounts of this gas change the climate –
making drought more likely in some places, for example. So conservation
agriculture will help make global weather patterns more reliable.
Farmers buy things like planters, subsoilers and seeds to practise conserva-
tion agriculture. That stimulates artisans, seed growers and traders to pro-
vide these items. Higher yields also mean farmers have more produce to
sell and more money to spend. This in turn stimulates markets and growth
in the local and national economy.
How much yield does conservation
agriculture produce?
The easy way to find out how much extra yield conservation agriculture will
bring is to try it out.
1
Get together with a group of neighbours, and set aside a field for conserva-
tion agriculture.
2
Decide which conservation agriculture practices you want to use on this
field. Decide who is going to do the work.
3
Meet regularly throughout the season to check on the crop and discuss any
problems.
4
Keep careful records on the types and amounts of inputs you use, the
amount of labour needed, and so on.
5
At harvest, measure the amount of grain or other yield produced. Com-
pare this with your regular practices.

172
Conservation Agriculture
Here are some questions to ask:
How much grain and other types of yield did the field produce?
How much work did it take?
How much did you have to spend for inputs?
Check the soil. Is there more organic matter? How about the number of
earthworms? Does it feel hard or soft? Is there a difference in the amount
of erosion (rills in the ground, silt in water draining from the field, etc.)?
Remember, you may not begin to see the full benefits of conservation agricul-
ture for several years. If your field produced no more grain in the first year,
don’t give up! Keep using conservation agriculture on the same field for an-
other year or two, and you should see real differences.
How much does conservation
agriculture cost?
If you have done the kind of test above, or if you have already started using
conservation agriculture, you can draw on your own experience and records
to calculate the costs and benefits. It is easy to do this if you keep records of
what you have bought and the money you have spent on your farm (see box
on page 174). If necessary, ask an extension worker to help you do this.
If you have not yet started using conservation agriculture, it is hard to decide
what your costs would be and how much profit you would make. Where can
you find the information you need?
Think of changes you would need to make, extra equipment you would
need, and new types of seeds and agrochemicals you would have to buy.
Perhaps you belong to a farmers’ group that has tried conservation agri-
culture. Or maybe you can ask other farmers about their experience. Ask
how much various items cost, and how much yield they harvested from
their conservation agriculture fields compared to their conventional fields.
If you buy equipment or animals, remember they will last more than one
season. You may have to spend a lot of money this year, but none next
year. You may be able to get a loan to help cover the cost.
Remember, you do not have to buy all the equipment at once! If you farm
using a hoe, you probably don’t need any new equipment. But if you use
an animal-drawn plough, you would need to buy (or hire) a subsoiler or
ripper if you don’t already have one.
Also remember that labour and other costs may be high in the first year.
For example, weeds may be a major problem before your cover crop is
established, so you may have to hire labourers to weed for you. You may
also need to buy cover crop seed. In the second year, you may be able to use
seed you have grown yourself.

Some of the things to take into account when you are calculating costs

174
Conservation Agriculture
You can calculate the costs of practising conservation agriculture by adding
up the costs of equipment and draught animals, inputs such as fertilizer and
herbicides, and operations such as field preparation and weeding.
The following sections show how to do this. Fill in the tables on the following
pages with your own figures so you can calculate your own costs.
Equipment and draught animal costs
1 List the different items of equipment and draught animals you bought last
year for conservation agriculture (or would have to buy next year). Write
down how much each one cost (A, in Table 1 on the next page).
2
Add the amount you spent to run and maintain the equipment (for exam-
ple, the cost of repairing a sprayer) (B).
3 Sum the amounts. This is your total cost of equipment and animals (E).
Keeping records
It’s a good idea to keep records of your farm, even if you are not considering taking up
conservation agriculture.
Why should you take the trouble to do this?
Because it helps you make the right decisions. For example, do you have enough money
to invest in a ripper? Is it a good idea, or would you be better off investing in something
else? Should you ask the bank for a loan, and if so, can you afford to repay it? Should you
apply a herbicide this year, or is it cheaper to slash weeds by hand?
You can answer questions like these only if you have good records.
What type of records should you keep? Here’s a summary:
Costs
The cost and quantity of equipment (plough, draft animals, ripper, jab planter, sprayer,
etc.).
The cost and quantity of inputs (herbicides, seeds, fertilizer, etc.).
The cost of farm operations (land clearing, planting, spraying, weeding, harvesting,
drying, transport, etc.).
Income
The quantity of crop you harvest and the price you received when you sell it (or the
price you would get if you were to sell it).
Operations
For each crop: the crop variety, seeding rate, dates planted and harvested, dates of
key operations (fertilization, weeding, pest control), yield and price.
For fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides: type of chemical used, dates of applica-
tion, and application rates.

175
11

Input costs
1
List the different types of inputs you have used (or plan to use next year):
seeds, fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides. Write down how much you paid
for each (Table 2).
2
Sum the amounts. This is your total cost of inputs (I).
Operation costs
1
List all the field operations, starting with field preparation and ending
with transport and sale of the produce. It’s easiest if you write down the
dates as well to make sure you don’t forget something. Also include any
interest payments you have made for credit (Table 3).
2
For each operation, write down how much you paid for it (for example, to
hire workers or to pay for transport).
3
Sum the amounts. This is your total costs of operations (K).
Total cost
Add the costs of equipment, inputs and operations together (Table 4). This is
your total cost per year.
Total cost = Equipment cost + Input cost + Operations cost
T = E + I + K
Note that you will have to buy the equipment only once, so your expenses next
year should be lower. If you do not need to buy any more equipment, your
costs next year will be:
Total cost = Input cost + Operations cost
T = I + K

Buying expensive equipment
You don’t have to buy a sprayer or subsoiler every year – it should last for several years. So
if you want, you can spread the cost over that time (accountants call this “depreciation”).
Fill in the table below to take this into account in your calculations.

You can now use this figure to calculate your total cost per year:
Total cost = Depreciated equipment cost + Input cost + Operations cost
T = D + I + K
But you still have to pay for equipment all in one go. Or do you? Here are some ways to get
around this:
Get a loan from a bank or from your farmers’ association to buy the equipment. You
can repay the loan in several easy stages.
Band together with a group of other farmers, and buy the equipment as a group. You
will have to agree on who can use it when, and who is responsible for repairing and
maintaining it.
Ask the equipment supplier for credit. They may be willing to accept a down-payment
now, and wait for the balance until the end of the season.

Conservation Agriculture
Using stones to calculate costs
Instead of using a pencil and paper, you can use stones, twigs or grains to calculate your
costs. You can also use this method if you are an extension agent working with a group of
farmers.
You will need a pile of small stones (or grains or pieces of twig). One stone can represent
100 shillings, or 10 rand, or whatever your currency is.
You can draw a table on the ground, or use a big sheet of paper so everyone can see and
participate in the discussion.
1
Equipment costs
List the various types of equipment you have bought. For each
piece of equipment, put the right number of stones next to it to show how much it cost.
2
Input costs
List the various types of inputs used. Next to each input, put the right
number of stones to represent how much it cost.
3
Operation costs
List the various operations done. For each operation, put down
the right number of stones to show its cost.
Add up all the stones to get the total cost.

Is conservation agriculture profitable?
Profit is your income minus your costs. Here is how to calculate it.
Income
1
List the crops you have produced using conservation agriculture: maize,
beans, cover crops, etc. (Table 5).
2
For each crop, write down how many kilograms or bags you harvested.
(Make sure you count all the various types of yield. For example, your cover
crops might produce firewood, fodder you can feed to your animals, as
well as seed you can sell to your neighbours.)
3
Write down the price you got per kilogram or bag for each crop. (It doesn’t
matter if you sold only part of the crop and your family ate the rest: treat it
as if you had sold all of it. For fodder, work out how much you would have
to pay for the same amount of fodder if you had to buy it.)
4
Multiply the number of bags or kilograms harvested by the price per bag
or kilogram to get your income from each crop.
5
Sum the amounts for each crop. This is your total income (N).
Profit
Subtract your total costs (T) from your income (N). This is your profit (P).
P = N – T
If the answer is greater than zero, you made a profit. If it’s less than zero, you
made a loss!

Conservation Agriculture
Is conservation agriculture
worthwhile?
To decide whether it is worthwhile to start practising conservation agricul-
ture, you need to know which is more profitable: conservation agriculture or
your current practice?
To work this out, simply make two sets of calculations:
One for conservation agriculture (outlined in the previous sections)
Another for your normal practice.
You can now compare the results. Which one gives you the best yields? Which
one gives you the highest profit?
See the box on the next page for an example of this type of calculation.
Using stones to calculate profits
You can use stones to calculate profits in a similar way to costs (see previous box).
1
Income List the various types of yield from your crops. You can use leaves or seeds
of each type of crop so you remember which one is which.
2
For each crop you sold, work out how much money you got when you sold it. Put the
equivalent number of stones next to that crop.
3
If you did not sell all of a crop (for example, if you and your family ate some of it), work
out how much money you would have got if you had sold it. Put the equivalent number
of stones next to that crop.
4
Add up all the stones. This represents your income.
5
Profit Take total costs you calculated earlier (see previous box) away from the
income. This is your profit.

Profit from conservation agriculture in Ghana
An experiment in Ghana over six years found that ripping produced more than twice as
much maize as slash-and-burn farming: 1200 kg per hectare instead of just 500 kg.
Not only that: the farmers saved labour too. Slashing fallow vegetation is hard work: it took
83 person-days to clear and weed a hectare of land using the conventional approach.
Using herbicide, it took only 48 person-days to do the same job.
The result: a profit of 940,000 cedis from conservation agriculture, compared to a loss of
495,000 cedis from slash-and-burn.
The farmers did not get the full benefits in the first year because it took several years to
control weeds and they learn how to use the new equipment.

Conservation Agriculture
How much work is conservation
agriculture?
It’s easy to account for hired labour: you just add up the money you pay the
labourers. But how about the work you and your family do – that you don’t
get paid for? How to keep track of this? How to tell whether conservation
agriculture is more or less work?
1 List all the activities you and your family have done for conservation agri-
culture throughout the year. It’s easiest if you write down the dates as
well, so you don’t forget something (Table 6).
2 For each activity, work out how many person-days it took. Count each
person separately. So if weeding took two people 3 days, count that as 2 x
3 = 6 person-days.
3 Sum the number of person-days. This is your total family labour input (L).
You can now compare the amount of work you and your family put in to
conservation agriculture with the amount you do for your normal farming
practice. Which takes more work? Is the extra work worth it?
When is the work needed?
Conservation agriculture may need work at different times of year from usual.
For example, you may need to do less work for land preparation (because you
don’t have to plough), but more work to control weeds later in the season.
How to account for your family’s labour
If you want to include family labour in your calculations of costs and profit (like in the box
on the previous page), you have to convert the number of days spent into money terms –
even though nobody from the family actually got paid for their work. Doing so gives you a
clearer picture of whether it’s better to adopt conservation agriculture, stick with your
normal farming practices, or look for other work.
You can work out the money value of your family labour like this: think of how much it would
have cost to hire someone to do the same amount of work.
For example, maybe it took 6 person-days (2 persons for 3 days) to plant your conserva-
tion agriculture field. If it costs $2 to hire a worker for one day in your village, then the
equivalent cost of your family labour was: 6 person-days x $2 dollars = $12.
Beware: the costs of hiring workers can vary a lot: they go up if there is a lot of work to be
done, if there are few labourers available for hire, or if other costs go up. So try to use the
actual wage you would have to pay.
The result will only be an estimate. For example, it will not necessarily reflect things such
as the quality of work (family members usually take more care than hired workers), or the
fact that you really might not be able to hire anyone. But think about it: giving an approxi-
mate value to your family labour may be better than not counting it at all.

More time for beekeeping
Conservation agriculture has freed up so much of Rose Masai’s time that she has been
able to start a new business – honey production.
Rose farms in Teso, Busia District, in western Kenya. Honey Care, a Kenyan firm, intro-
duced local farmers to honey production. The firm provided hives for a quarterly fee, and
would collect honey every 3 months. Akrukranut, a local community-based organization in
Busia bought a centrifuge, so now Rose and other farmers produce honey themselves.
Business is good. Rose makes a profit of KSh 20,000 a year from her honey, and she now
has seven hives.
Determining labour distribution for various farming operations
Using stones to calculate labour needs
You can use stones to calculate the labour needs for conservation agriculture. You can do
this at the same time as you are working out the costs of each operation.
1
Total amount of work
List all the activities you and your family have done for con-
servation agriculture throughout the year.
2
Put stones next to each activity: one stone for each week a person worked.
3
Add up the number of stones to get the total family labour input.
4
Timing of work
Draw 12 columns next to your list of activities. Put the name of a
month on each column: January, February, and so on.
5
Using the same stones as above, divide the pile for each activity among the months.
So if it took you 2 weeks to weed in January, put 2 stones in the January column.
6
Sum the stones for each month to get the total family labour input for that month.
If you want to see who did what, you can use different coloured stones or different types of
grain or leaves to represent each person.

More maize for less work in Ghana
Farmers in Brong Ahafo in Ghana have found they can get higher yields with less work.
They have started using minimum tillage and to plant leguminous cover crops. The cover
crops include mucuna, lablab, Canavalia and Pueraria. These crops suppress weeds
and raise the soil fertility.
Before these new techniques were introduced, farmers would use slash-and-burn to
clear land. They had few tools – only hoes, machetes and dibble sticks, so could not farm
large areas. The result was declining soil fertility and falling yields.
In 1996, the Sedentary Farming Systems Project (SFSP) introduced conservation agricul-
ture to the region. The project was a joint initiative of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture,
GTZ and the German Development Service.
The new methods enable farmers to do 20–40% less work, but get 50% higher yields.
Women farmers are especially happy: they now have time to do trading or other outside
work, which brings in as much as one-third of their income.

Conservation Agriculture
T
HE SUCCESS of conservation agriculture depends not only on whether it can
produce high yields or good profits. It also depends on local customs and
culture, the way people think of farming and the unwritten rules they follow.
This chapter looks at how conservation agriculture is affected by two issues:
The different roles and special needs of women and men.
How cultural beliefs affect people’s willingness to consider conservation
agriculture.
This chapter also looks at how conservation agriculture can provide opportu-
nities for special groups of people. It shows how it can:
Help families cope with the challenge of HIV/AIDS.
Help farmers with physical disabilities.
Provide incentives for young people to stay in farming.
Women and men
In many villages and in most families, men and
women tend to be responsible for different things.
They do different things, know different things,
and have different interests, priorities and needs.
They have different backgrounds and experi-
ences, and their families, neighbours and soci-
ety as a whole expect men to fulfil certain roles,
and women to perform other roles.
Labour
In some places, for example, men may
plough the land and sell the produce, leaving
the women to do the planting, weeding and har-
vesting. In other places, women may do the land
preparation. Men and women may each tend
different fields and grow different crops. Men
are often responsible for the crops that can be
sold for cash, while women deal with the lower-
status crops the family eats every day. It may be culturally unacceptable (or at
least unusual) for a woman to handle draught animals or drive a tractor. In
general, women do more farm work than men, though this is often not recog-
nized.
Income
Husbands and wives do not necessarily share their incomes. Men
may keep the money they earn, and give only part of it to their wives to buy
food and other essentials. Women may earn their own money by selling pro-
duce, making cakes or beer, or trading.
Markets
Women tend to sell their produce close to home. Men are more
likely to take their produce to distant markets for sale.

189
12
Conservation Agriculture and People
Information and knowledge
Men are more likely than women to attend
extension meetings and be members of farmer groups. They tend to be better
educated, go to town more often, and have better access to information from
outside. Because of their backgrounds, women and men tend to know about
different things: men understand machinery and marketing, women know
about nutrition and weed management.
Decision making
Men often make the key decisions in the family, while
women do more of the farm work. Many men go to the cities in search of
work, leaving the womenfolk to look after the farm. The women then either
have to wait for the men to decide what to do, or they have to make the deci-
sion themselves.
Rights
Women tend to have fewer rights than men. Men normally own the
land, and in some countries, women cannot even legally own it. Even if it is
legal, they are prohibited from doing so by local custom. Wives may find their
male relatives deprive them of their land and livelihood when their husband
dies. As the formal head of household, a husband may be more likely than his
wife to qualify for credit.
Freedoms
In many places, women have fewer freedoms than men. Perhaps
this is because of traditional views that “the woman’s place is in the home”.
Or it may be that women are afraid to go far from home without protection.
Priorities and needs
Because they are responsible for different tasks and
have different types of knowledge and experience, men and women tend to
have different priorities. A man may want to buy an ox to pull farm equip-
ment, for example, while a woman may prefer to buy a weed wiper to help
her control weeds.
Freedom of expression
Women may be unwilling or unable to express their
views. For example, they may not dare to speak out in public, especially if they
have different views from their husbands.
Don’t forget the children
Children also contribute to their families. From an early age, they do a surprising amount
of work around the farm:
They plough, plant and weed crops, spread fertilizer and carry loads. They scare
birds away from ripening fields of grain.
They fetch water, collect firewood and help cook.
They tend animals and keep them off the fields.
They look after younger brothers and sisters, freeing their parents to do other things.
Often, they do all these things in addition to their full-time job: going to school!
Children who have lost their parents to AIDS may have to take on the full burden of feeding
and caring for their younger brothers and sisters.

190
Conservation Agriculture
Conservation agriculture, women and men
Conservation agriculture may affect men and women in many different ways.
That may make them more (or less) willing to adopt it, or may influence the
particular techniques they decide to use. Some examples:
Conservation agriculture may cut the amount of labour needed overall,
but it may increase the amount of work that women and children have to
do.
Eliminating ploughing (traditionally men’s work) may make it easier for
women to adopt conservation agriculture.
Men who control the family budget may be unwilling to invest in a weed
wiper, which would ease the burden of weeding for women.
These distinctions are not always clear-cut. And they differ from place to place
and from family to family. Traditional patterns are breaking down anyway as
families are forced to cope with the stress of AIDS and migration. A widow
may have no choice but to do traditional “men’s work” if she is to feed her
family. On the other hand, she may find it impossible to do so if she cannot get
the support (land, labour, credit, inputs) she needs.
Even though it is difficult to generalize, the differences between men and
women are real. And they affect how people may see conservation agriculture
and how ready they may be to adopt it.
Ideas for action
If you are an extension agent or development worker, here are some ways to
help women and men adopt conservation agriculture, or to help them choose
the techniques best suited to them.
Less work for men, but more work for women
Farmers in central Ghana are pleased that conservation agriculture has saved them
work. Using minimum tillage and planting cover crops has restored the fertility of their soil
and has improved crop yields. And it takes at least 30% less work than the traditional
slash-and-burn practices. These techniques were introduced by Sasakawa Global 2000
in collaboration with Monsanto and the Ministry of Agriculture.
But not everyone is happy. Higher yields mean more work harvesting and transporting the
grain. Those jobs fall mainly to women and children.
Women say that they now have less time for trading and other types of work, which brings
in about one-third of their income. Money from maize sales, on the other hand, goes to
their husbands, who decide on how to use it. Often, the men do not share it fairly with their
wives.
The women think that the men should help them harvest and transport the grain, and
should share the proceeds more fairly.

191
12
Conservation Agriculture and People
Understand the roles and views of men and women
It may be necessary to
do some research into this before you start promoting conservation agricul-
ture. Try to understand men’s and women’s viewpoints, their roles, cultural
beliefs and other things that may affect how they manage their farms. You can
do this by observing what people do, discussing with key informants and dif-
ferent interest groups, and participatory rural appraisal (PRA) exercises. Con-
sider holding separate meetings for women (using a woman facilitator) to make
sure they have a chance to express their views.
Anticipate problems
Check whether conservation agriculture is likely to have
any unforeseen effects. For example:
Replacing ploughing or hoeing with ripping may deprive the people who
did the land preparation of an important source of income.
In the first few seasons, men’s workloads may fall (no ploughing), while
women’s may increase (more weeding).
Encourage flexibility
Discuss the changes with men and women, and en-
courage them to take on new roles. Train women how to handle animal-drawn
rippers, and encourage men to do weeding. Men may be more willing to weed
if they can use herbicide (spraying is often a man’s job).
Ensure that women are not overburdened
Talk with families (especially men
and elders) about the advantages of conservation agriculture. Point out that
there may be more work to do in weeding and harvesting, and facilitate the
community to come up with solutions. For example, families might consider
using some of their profits to buy a sprayer that cuts the time needed for weed-
ing. Elders may be willing to influence men to help with some of the work that
women traditionally do.
Plan extension activities for everyone
Recognize you have to talk to the
women (and young and old people) as well as the men! Pay special attention
to women: plan extension activities and demonstrations especially for them.
Hold meetings for a convenient time of day so women can attend.
Involve men and women
Ensure that both women and men are involved in
planning, designing and implementing conservation agriculture activities.
Encourage women to take leadership positions in groups.
Check equipment
Check whether there are likely to be any restrictions in
women or men using conservation agriculture equipment. A weed wiper may
be more appropriate for women than a sprayer, for example. You may have to
run separate training courses for women and men on using animal-drawn
implements.
Provide information in an appropriate way
Find out how men and women
in a particular community get information. For example, men may listen to the
radio or ask retailers for advice, while women may get information from the
local market. Use these channels to spread the message about conservation
agriculture. Tailor your message to your audience, and then choose how to get
the message to them. For example, you might ask nurses and midwives to tell

192
Conservation Agriculture
women how to use conservation agriculture to grow vegetables. Make sure
you use the right type of language: use simple words and avoid jargon.
Help people get inputs and credit
Assist men and women to access credit,
seed supplies, implements, agrochemicals, and services such as hiring of
draught animals. Pay special attention to women groups: the group as a whole
may be able to buy implements for its members to use.
Assist with marketing
Help women to form marketing groups, and put them
in touch with traders and transport firms so they can sell surplus produce.
Focus on the family partnership
Encourage the family to work as a unit,
rather than focusing on the differences between men and women. Dividing
up responsibilities is normal, but everyone’s main goal should be the family’s
welfare and livelihood.
Cultural beliefs
People’s culture and traditional beliefs may help or hinder efforts to promote
conservation agriculture.
Here are some examples of ways that culture can hinder its promotion, along
with some suggestions on what to do about it (in italics):
Staple foods
Throughout southern Africa, people think of maize as their
main food. It can be difficult to convince them to rotate their crops. In some
areas, people still plant maize even though it is not the ideal crop. For exam-
ple, parts of Mokhotlong district in Lesotho are above 2500 m and are very
cold, but everybody grows maize even though yields are very poor. (Ask them
if they have considered growing something else and selling it, then buying maize to
eat.)
Fire
Many farmers like to burn stubble and weeds to clear the land before
planting. Livestock owners also use fire to manage pastures. These practices
have even been promoted by extension services. (Burning destroys valuable crop
residues and threatens cover crops growing during the dry season. Much better to
leave the residue on the surface as mulch.)
Luo rituals delay farming
The Luo of Nyanza Province in western Kenya have many traditions and beliefs related to
farming. They say that if they fail to observe certain rituals, the community will be visited by
a calamity. The eldest person in a family must perform these rituals before others can
start work on their farms each year. It is taboo for anyone to begin farming before the
ceremony has been performed.
But what if the person who performs the ritual is away working in town? Or has suc-
cumbed to AIDS? This can lead to indecision and delay. Vital days or weeks may be lost
before the person can return to perform the ritual, or another solution can be found.

193

Conservation Agriculture and People
Ploughing
Ploughing is associated with many mistaken beliefs:
A “good farmer” is often seen as someone whose field has been ploughed
and cleared of everything. A farmer with crop residue is seen as lazy. (No:
a good farmer is one who gets good yields and conserves the soil.)
Many farmers think that they must plough to make sure the soil soft so that
roots can penetrate easily. (In fact, the opposite is true: ploughing destroys the
soil structure and creates a hardpan.)
Farmers believe that they have to plough organic matter under to make
compost. (Not true: organic matter is more valuable if it is left on the surface.)
The soil must be ploughed in order for the rain to penetrate and keep mois-
ture in the soil. (Again, the opposite is true: rain sinks into the soil more easily
if the soil is covered with mulch or vegetation.)
Fatalism
Some people believe they are poor and will be poor for the rest of
their lives. (They forget that they can find a way out of poverty; conservation agri-
culture offers them a way to do this.)
Land ownership and tenure
This is an economic and political issue as well
as a cultural and social one. If the land is owned communally (or by the state),
individual farmers may have little incentive to improve their soil. Communal

grazing may mean they cannot keep animals out of their fields. And in many
places women cannot own or inherit land. (Reach agreements in the community
to guarantee security of tenure.)
Ideas for action
It can be very difficult as an outsider to address issues of culture. Many tradi-
tions have a practical reason that may not be immediately obvious. Or they are
rooted in history. People see their culture as part of their identity, and chang-
ing it is very difficult.
On the other hand, mistaken beliefs can seriously harm development. Every-
one has a belief system. The question is whether it contains the truth. Here are
some ideas on what to do if you are an extension agent or development worker.
Understand and respect the culture
Do not automatically condemn beliefs
as “wrong” or “bad”. Rather, try to understand them and the reasons behind
them.
Facilitate discussion
Help the community to start to talk about their beliefs.
If they recognize a problem, they may be ready to find ways to solve it.
Focus on important issues
There is no point in trying to address a particular
cultural practice if it is not important.
Build on the culture
If you understand the culture and are willing to listen
to people, you may be able to identify beliefs and practices that support con-
servation agriculture. For example, people may already use certain plants as
cover crops, or be able to suggest other plants that may be suitable. They may
have views about the benefits (or disadvantages) of intercropping. They may
be interested in trying out new ideas, or in reviving traditional practices.
Work with respected community members
Listen to elders, chiefs and other
respected people in the community, and try to get them to support your mes-
sage.
No house? No trees
“In western Kenya we found a widow not really participating in the project on fruit trees and
planting legumes. We found out later that in that village, a widow was not allowed to plant
trees if her husband had not built her a house before he died. We brought this up at a
village meeting, and the people decided to abandon this practice. This widow is now one
of the resource farmers in the area.”

HIV/AIDS
AIDS and the virus that causes it, HIV, have a devastating effect on farm
families in Africa.
AIDS directly affects the most productive people in the society: adults who
would normally support themselves, their children and their elderly rela-
tives. When they fall ill, farming has to be done by weaker, less productive
people: the very young and the very old.
These family members have a double burden: they have to look after their
sick relatives, and they have to take over their work. They cultivate smaller
plots, and grow a smaller range of less labour-intensive crops. They strug-
gle to keep pace with the seasonal calendar. They plant late and fail to
weed on time, so reap smaller yields. Their diet is poorer and they go hun-
gry more often, so they become even less productive and fall ill more often.
Unable to grow enough to feed themselves, and beset by medical bills and
funeral expenses, desperate families are forced to sell what they have. They
sell farm implements, draught animals and land to raise money. They have
less to invest in their farms.
Relatives of the deceased may seize the family’s property, leaving widows
and orphans destitute.
The survivors – orphans, the elderly, and women – may lack the right skills
to use equipment, so it falls into disrepair. They may find it particularly
difficult to get credit or extension advice.
Many communities have traditional ways of supporting less fortunate peo-
ple. But these customs may be stretched to breaking point by the large num-
bers of illnesses and deaths.
Junior farmer field schools in Swaziland
AIDS has been a disaster for Shewula, in eastern Swaziland. So many of the adults have
died that the community has more than 2000 orphans.
FAO-supported projects have introduced conservation agriculture in the area and are
working with the orphans.
The orphans are learning conservation agriculture practices through “Junior Farmer Field
Schools”. For these children, conservation agriculture has two advantages over conven-
tional farming: it requires less money and takes less work.
One of the things the children learn is how to make compost. They use this instead of
expensive artificial fertilizer on their maize and sorghum. They intercrop these cereals
with legumes, which improve the soil fertility and provide nutritious beans.
They grow some legumes as a relay crop to cover the soil during the winter, which is the
dry season in Swaziland. That increases crop yields during the following season. This
practice enables them to harvest two crops from the field in the same year.

Conservation Agriculture
Conservation agriculture and AIDS
Conservation agriculture can help overcome some of these problems.
No more ploughing
It eliminates ploughing – one of the biggest tasks on
a farmer’s calendar.
Less weeding
Using cover crops, mulch and herbicides controls weeds
better than traditional methods – saving time on weeding, another of the
most time-consuming tasks in farming.
Low-labour implements
Using a jab-planter is faster and less laborious
than planting using a hoe. Some jab-planters can plant and apply fertilizer
at the same time. Weed wipers are easy to use and effective at controlling
weeds.
Crop diversity
Growing intercrops and rotating crops allow farmers to
diversify their crops and produce a nutritious range of food on the same
plot. AIDS patients and their families need nutritious, balanced diets. Many
of the intercrops and cover crops used in conservation agriculture are high
in protein and vitamins.
Ideas for action
Here are some ways that extension agents and development workers can help
people use conservation agriculture to cope with AIDS.
Provide extension support
Discuss with local people and community groups
how best to work with AIDS patients and their families. Work out how to tell
them about conservation agriculture and the benefits of legumes and other
crop options.
Identify and support vulnerable households
If possible, find out who is
affected by AIDS (either as a patient or because someone in their family is
infected). Design extension activities especially for them. Help them choose
crops and varieties that are nutritious. Provide advice on nutrition, and teach
them recipes that use new types of food – for example, how to fortify maize
flour with protein-rich legumes or amaranth.
Encourage farmers to plant nutritious crops
Examples are cowpeas, pigeon-
peas, lablab, climbing beans, ground beans, groundnuts, mungbeans, sweet
potatoes, pumpkins, amaranths and other indigenous vegetables. In many ar-
eas, farmers can plant traditional vegetables that are easy to grow and suited
to the local conditions.
Encourage support groups
Groups can help in many ways. Members can
pool their labour, contribute money to buy equipment, exchange ideas, and
learn new techniques together.

Conservation Agriculture and People
If a blind man can do conservation agriculture, so can you!
Pahlo is an old man who lives in Ha Monoto village, in the heart of the mountains of
Lesotho. Every day, he goes out to tend his fields of maize, sorghum and beans.
Not unusual, you might think. But wait: Pahlo is blind.
The village church had been conducting training on conservation agriculture. Farmers
were given strings with marks at regular intervals to show them how far apart to dig
planting basins. Each trainee received several strings, so they could teach other farmers.
One gave a string to Pahlo, who carefully tied on pieces of plastic so he could feel where
to dig the holes.
Every morning, Pahlo’s two grandsons take him down the mountain to his fields. They
help him to find where he left off the previous day, then they leave for school. Pahlo digs
the basins with a spade, then puts seeds and the right amount of fertilizer in the hole with
a little cup. He plants the whole day, until his grandchildren come to fetch him.
Conservation agriculture has brought hope to Pahlo. For the first time in his life, he is able
to plant his field.

Stroke does not stop Lesotho farmer
A farmer in Seforong, Lesotho, suffered a mild stroke a few years ago. He was immobi-
lized so could no longer walk behind his oxen to plough his field. And he cannot afford to
pay for a tractor to do the ploughing.
He attended training on conservation agriculture and learned how to make planting ba-
sins. He still walks with great difficulty, but is proud that he can now provide for his family
despite his disability.

Farmers with disabilities
Physically challenged people have great difficulty in providing for their fami-
lies. But conservation agriculture has enabled people with serious disabilities
to feed  themselves and their families, restore their dignity, and change their
lives.
People with disabilities may need special help to adapt the technology to their
needs. Extension staff and development workers should do their best to pro-
vide this assistance.

198
Conservation Agriculture
Young people
Farming is not an attractive option for many young people. Low yields mean
low incomes, and the cities offer opportunities that are absent in the village.
Many young people opt to try their luck in town rather than stay on the farm.
But young people are Africa’s future, and they are vital if Africa’s agriculture
is to prosper. Young people have skills, energy and creativity. They are quick
to learn and open to new ideas.
Conservation agriculture offers incentives for young people to stay in farming:
It offers the prospect of higher yields than conventional farming. It requires
less work and less investment in expensive equipment such as ploughs.
It opens opportunities for young people to provide specialized services,
such as spraying, field preparation, servicing and repair of implements,
vegetable growing and seed production.
A future for delinquent youths
Conservation agriculture can be an important component in efforts to work with delin-
quent youths.
In 2004, a group of young men in Oliosirkon, close to Ongata Rongai near Nairobi, were
making themselves a nuisance. They were either orphans or were from homes that did
not provide them with support. Most had little formal education, and they earned money
through casual labour when they could get work. They took drugs, and had little hope of
improving their lot in life.
Local people were fed up with these lads, so they decided to force them to leave. But one
woman asked permission to work with them for four months – before the community took
such drastic action.
A committed Christian, she met with them twice a week to worship and study the Bible.
Under her guidance, the youths decided to reach out to other young people and to people
affected by AIDS. They began to visit the sick, and invited other youths to join them. One
asked for help to begin another group for delinquent boys nearby.
One of the major difficulties the lads face is how to earn a living. They tried planting kale,
but it withered for lack of water. In 2005, they were introduced to conservation farming.
They carefully prepared and planted two plots of land. They received a small amount of
financial assistance to buy fertilizer and seed (and fencing, because herders in the area
allow their cattle to feed on whatever is growing!).
Other people have heard about conservation agriculture, and the youths have arranged to
give a seminar on how to do it. They are now thinking of starting a small business as well.
Conservation agriculture has taken these young people off the streets and has given
them a way to make a living.

Conservation Agriculture and People
Company encourages children to teach parents
Reapers, a Zimbabwean firm that produces groundnuts and other crops, normally con-
tracts out its seed production to small-scale farmers.
The firm encourages children to help their parents maintain their farm records. It also
gives prizes to the parents who have performed best – it donates seed to their children’s
schools so they can start school gardens.
Ideas for action
Here are some ideas to try with young people:
Open dialogue
Discuss conservation agriculture with young people in
youth clubs, sports clubs, drama groups, etc.
Find attractive options
Seek options that may appeal to young people –
for example those that can provide quick returns, such as vegetable grow-
ing.
Work with schools
Find ways to teach conservation agriculture in schools.
Establish a school nursery to produce seeds or seedlings.
Work with the private sector
Involve private companies in promoting
conservation agriculture. Young people are tomorrow’s customers!

Encouraging
adaptation and
adoption

202
Conservation Agriculture
P
EOPLE DO NOT change by just looking. Conservation agriculture will not nec-
essarily spread by itself. Few innovations do.
The techniques have to be adapted to suit local conditions. Conservation agri-
culture has to be supported and actively promoted by government, extension
services, development agencies and the private sector.
Not only that: a drastic mind shift has to take place, not only in the minds of
farmers, but also among extension personnel, government officials, research-
ers, and others involved in agriculture. Conservation agriculture goes against
many of the things they have learned and regard as “true”: not ploughing, for
example, or leaving as much cover on the soil as possible.
Training and extension are important ways to achieve this mind shift, as well
as to provide the skills and information necessary. But they are not the only
ways. This chapter describes various ways to promote conservation agricul-
ture and adapt it to local needs.
The effort is worth it. Millions of lives could be changed if the message of con-
servation agriculture gets out to struggling farmers.
This chapter is aimed at extension agents, development workers and trainers
who are interested in promoting conservation agriculture.
Adapting conservation agriculture
You have visited a group of farmers in the neighbouring district, and have
seen how they practise conservation agriculture. Their crops look healthy, their
soil is rich in humus, and they get good yields. You’d like to help farmers in
your area take up conservation agriculture. They just need to copy the farmers
you have visited.
Right?
Not necessarily. Technologies that work well in one place may not fit condi-
tions in your area. Your area might get less rain. Your soil may be sandier.
Farmers in your area may want to grow different crops.
So you may have to adapt the conservation agriculture technologies to suit
your area. You might even have to invent new methods. It is not a question of
technology transfer, but of adaptation and experimentation.
Conservation agriculture is not one set of techniques. Rather, it is a set of prin-
ciples that can be adapted to suit local conditions. It is important for farmers
to experiment and learn, and to share their results with their neighbours. Farm-
ers can do this on their own, but it is much easier if extension agents, develop-
ment workers and researchers can help them.
Adaptive research is a way of trying conservation agriculture (or any other
technology) in an organized, systematic way. There are many ways of doing

203
13 Encouraging Adaptation and Adoption
it. Researchers can test technologies under
controlled conditions on the experiment
farm. They can conduct trials on farmers’
fields. Farmers and extension personnel can
take the lead, with researchers providing
advice and support. Or farmers can do re-
search by themselves, perhaps with advice
or inputs such as seeds from researchers or
extension staff.
Adaptive research is best if farmers are at
the centre. This has various advantages:
The conditions are realistic, so the tech-
nology is tested in real-world conditions.
Farmers can draw on their own experi-
ence, and will choose to test things that
they feel they can do and afford.
People learn best when they are actually doing something and discovering
for themselves, rather than merely watching someone else. Farmers can go
on to use the same approach to test other innovations.
Their results carry more weight and will be more credible to other farmers
than if researchers were conducting the research.
Collaboration between researchers, extension staff and farmers combines
everyone’s knowledge, resources and energies. Farmers who have never tried
conservation agriculture will be more confident about embarking on the
research, taking calculated risks. Extension workers learn research methods
and can help spread them and the technologies tested to other villages.
Researchers become better aware of the needs and specific conditions that
farmers face. This in turn helps them make their research more relevant to
farmers and communities.
Farmer field schools (see below) are a good venue for adaptive research.
An undiscovered gold mine
Conservation agriculture is a gold mine, waiting to be discovered.
Conservation agriculture unlocks nature’s regenerative capacity.
Farmers can reverse the downward spiral they are in. Once they do so, nature will
help them.
The key is to stop the damage and destruction. Let nature’s power become a reality
on your farm.
Anyone can practise conservation agriculture – even a blind person (see page 197). You
can learn it too!
Remember the three princi-
ples of  conservation agricul-
ture:
• Disturb the soil as little as
possible.
• Keep the soil covered as
much as possible.
• Mix and rotate crops.

204
Conservation Agriculture
Demonstrations or adaptive research?
Many extension agents and farmers are familiar with on-farm demonstrations (see be-
low, page 211). Adaptive research is different in two important ways:
In research, no-one is quite sure what results to expect, because nobody from the
community has ever used the technology before.
Research usually compares several alternatives with each other, to find out which
one is best.
Research usually tries to build and compare a basket of options, rather than assum-
ing one single technology will be best suited for all farmers.
Things to adapt
It is possible to adapt many aspects of conservation agriculture. Here are some
ideas.
Crops and combinations
Which crops and which varieties grow best in
your conditions? When is it best to plant the main crop and the cover crop?
Is there enough soil moisture to plant earlier? Is it better to plant closer or
further apart? Which crops and cover crops grow best together? How much
compost or fertilizer is needed?
Soil cover
What is the best way to maintain soil cover? Are there dual-
purpose cover crops that provide both food and fodder? Can traditional
local cover crops be used instead of exotic types?
Equipment
Conservation agriculture equipment can be hard to find, too
expensive, or not suited to local conditions. But artisans can adapt existing
designs or make their own. Examples of such adaptations include the Zam-
bian Magoye ripper, planter, subsoiler, the Ugandan AEATRI knife-roller
and the Maresha modified conservation agriculture implements in Ethio-
pia.
In some situations, it may not be possible for farmers to use a full conservation
agriculture approach. But they can still introduce some of its elements and
benefit from improved yields and reduced soil erosion. Some examples:
Tillage methods
It may be impossible to introduce zero tillage, especially
when tef is the main crop. Alternatives may be strip tillage, minimum till-
age or a single ploughing (rather than multiple ploughings). Farmers can
still improve the soil structure and fertility by rotating crops. They can con-
trol weeds and obtain livestock fodder by planting cover crops.
Livestock
It may be impossible to keep livestock off the conservation ag-
riculture fields – especially in semi-arid areas where large numbers of ani-
mals are hungry in the dry season. Farmers may have to compromise with
livestock owners – for example, to allow the animals into the field for a
limited time only, so some cover is still left as mulch. Both farmers and
animal owners have to protect cover crops, just like a field of food crops.

A story of on-farm research
Below is a story about how one group of farmers tested a new conservation agriculture
technology on their farms. They followed a number of steps, from identifying a problem to
assessing the results.
This story is fictitious, but it is realistic. It shows that things do not always go as planned
– but that farmers can conduct research and that they can learn a lot from it.
Identify the problem to study
At a meeting, a group of 10 farmers agree that a key problem is to find the best time to
plant lablab in their maize field. Only one of them has actually planted lablab, and he got
mixed results. Some think they should plant as early as possible; others have heard it is
better to wait a little. But nobody, including the extension agent herself, is quite sure!
Identify the alternatives that may help solve the problem
The farmers discuss the issue extensively and get some feedback from a researcher
working nearby. They and the extension agent decide to test three planting times: (1)
planting the maize and lablab simultaneously; (2) planting lablab 2 weeks after maize;
and (3) planting lablab at the first weeding, about 1 month after the maize.
Decide on the details of the experiment
The farmers and extension agent decide that three farmers will do the experiment during
the next growing season. Each one will plant two of the three alternatives, as well as a
“control” plot without lablab, which is what they are used to. Each farmer will plant a small
plot 15 rows wide by 40 m long for each of the two alternatives and the control. They
decide to monitor lablab germination and growth, the labour costs, any signs that the
maize might be suffering from competition by lablab, as well as maize and lablab yields.
Each farmer will need to record the corresponding information. Since two of them do not
know how to write, they will need to ask for help from their children.
The group decides to organize three field tours for the group members: 1 month after
planting, at maize flowering, and at harvest time. The extension agent and the researcher
will attend as well.
Establish the experiments
The extension agent and farmers help the farmers establish the experiments. Things go
almost as planned, even though the extension agent showed up 2 hours late. Fortunately,
the researcher was there on time. The only worry is that one farmer planted 3 weeks later
than the others, because she was not feeling well.
Monitor the experiments and conduct the field tours
The monitoring is not easy. One farmer forgot to record the information about labour and
about competition. Another got confused and recorded the information in a rather chaotic
manner. But fortunately, the third farmer did what was expected, with the help of her older
son. The three field tours are quite a success, even though not everybody came, and not
all fields looked great. And the researcher missed the third tour because his car broke
down. But the tour took place anyway, and everybody had a lot of fun.

Conservation Agriculture
Ways to promote conservation
agriculture
Conservation agriculture may be difficult for people to accept because it goes
against many of their cherished beliefs. The biggest obstacle is to get people to
understand that ploughing destroys soils and the environment. Once they ac-
cept this, they may be willing to try something new.
It is not just farmers who have to change their thinking. Universities, agricul-
tural training institutions, extension providers, researchers and the farming
community itself must also change. Training is key to bringing this about.
Ironically, conservation agriculture practices are not totally new in Africa.
Many are traditional practices that have been forgotten. It is time to bring
them back.
Conservation agriculture can be promoted in many different ways:
Training
Training is necessary for various groups, including farmers, im-
plement makers, input suppliers and extension personnel.
Extension
The government extension service advises farmers on farming
technologies. It provides advice and training, and manages demonstrations
and field days. It can be an important promoter of conservation agricul-
ture.
Demonstrations
Demonstrations enable farmers to see conservation ag-
riculture in practice before they try it out themselves.
Farmer field schools
This is a participatory extension approach in which
farmers get together to study farming in their own fields.
A story of on-farm research (continued)
Assess the results and take a decision about how to plant lablab
With all the results available, the group and extension agent meet to look at what hap-
pened. The researcher is invited, as well as everyone else in the village. Flipcharts are
presented, and there are even a few photographs. Of the three experiments, one did not
work well: the farmer who planted late got sick again, and could not control weeds. Her
lablab did not produce anything, and her maize yielded little. But the other two experi-
ments worked well: they show clearly that it is better to wait before planting lablab.
Farmers agree indeed that planting lablab at the first weeding is best, because it saves
labour. The maize produced more in the plots with lablab than without.
At the end of the meeting, everybody is quite satisfied. Some farmers who are not part of
the group ask for some lablab seed. The group itself wants to keep experimenting next
season, but on something different. They ask what other cover crop they could plant in
their maize fields? They have heard of pigeonpea and mucuna. Some wonder if fodder
trees would be better than lablab, because they have trouble feeding their livestock. They
ask the researcher to come back with information on all this, and they ask him to get as
many different seeds as possible. The researcher promises to do his best.

Farmer champions
Farmer champions are people who have adopted con-
servation agriculture methods and can demonstrate their success to their
friends and neighbours. Because they farm locally, their neighbours are
likely to listen to them and copy what they do. The champions can provide
advice or seed, and can help organize other farmers into interest groups to
further promote conservation agriculture.
Farmer-to-farmer extension
Farmer-to-farmer extension involves using
farmers as extension agents.
Farmer organizations
Farmer organizations can provide vital support to
conservation agriculture efforts, especially when it is still new in the area.
Schools and churches
Schools and churches can play a key role in pro-
moting conservation agriculture.
Other ways to share experiences include field days, exchange visits, vid-
eos, and even radio programmes.
Farming as a business
Conservation agriculture offers an opportunity
to encourage farmers to see their farms as a business, rather than merely a
way to feed their families. Changing these attitudes can also promote con-
servation agriculture itself.
Multiple stakeholder partnerships
Partnerships between extension,
NGOs, various levels of government and the private sector are needed to
promote conservation agriculture.
Entrepreneurs
Conservation agriculture may require some new types of
equipment (rippers, planters) and agrochemicals (especially herbicide).
People who make this equipment and who sell the inputs needed are vital
if farmers are to have what they need to use this approach.
Policy support
Governments can promote conservation agriculture, or it
can hinder it. Experience in other countries has shown the importance of
appropriate policies for the success of conservation agriculture.
The rest of this chapter discusses each of these approaches in turn.
Training
When planning a training course on conservation agriculture, think of the
participants’ particular needs.
Farmers need practical skills in preparing the field, planting, controlling
weeds, and so on.
Group organizers and extension agents may need training on how to
organize farmer field schools or use other extension methods.
Equipment manufacturers need to know how to make and use different
types of equipment.
Extension workers and researchers need training in technical aspects of
conservation agriculture – on the principles as well as on how to do it.

Planning a course on conservation agriculture for farmers?
Here are some of the most important topics to cover when teaching conservation agricul-
ture to farmers. The appropriate sections of this manual are in italics in the list below.
Choose the topics you need for your particular group of participants.
What is conservation agriculture? (Chapter 1)
Addressing the problem Soil fertility and erosion, destructive role of ploughs (Chapter
4)
Change of mindset (Chapter 12)
Field preparation and planting Direct planting, permanent planting stations (mak-
ing and using strings, making holes, seeding rate in holes), ripping, subsoiling
(training animals, correct spacing, correct seeding rate in lines) (Chapter 3).
Conversation tillage tools and implements Operation principles, adjusting and
maintenance (Chapter 3).
Training work animals and users (See the next box)
Soil cover Use of cover crops, dry vegetation and crop residues as mulch (Chapter
5)
Crop rotation, choosing crops and crop combinations, seeds, integrated pest and
disease management, agroforestry (Chapter 6)
Improving soil fertility Manure, compost, inorganic fertilizer, making compost (Chap-
ter 4)
Weed management in conservation agriculture Mechanical, herbicides (Chapter
7)
Rainwater harvesting, soil and water conservation (Chapter 8)
Integrating livestock into conservation agriculture (Chapter 9)
Weed management (Chapter 7)
Conservation agriculture as a business
Planning a business, record keeping
(Chapter 11)
Promoting conservation agriculture
Working with groups, management of farmer
field schools (Chapter 13)
Social and cultural issues
Gender, HIV/AIDS, food and nutrition, schoolchildren,
youths, physically and mentally challenged farmers (Chapter 12)
The entry point and coverage of training courses will also depend on what the
participants already know. Build on their existing skills and knowledge. The
training should give them information they can use directly in their own work.
It should be as practical as possible. Training is best done not in the classroom,
but on the ground – in farmers’ fields, with farmers.

Training on draught animal power
It is necessary to train both the draught animals and their handlers on conservation
agriculture. Here are some topics to cover.
Selecting and caring for draught animals.
Making yokes and harnesses.
Harnessing draught animals.
Roping, yoking, walking in pairs and in pegged rows, pulling light weights and pro-
gressively increasing the load.
Using equipment safely.
Health of work animals.
Feeding work animals, including supplementary feeding.
Challenges in integrating animals in conservation agriculture operations, including
cover crops.
Using and transporting conservation agriculture equipment (direct planters, knife-
roller, ripper, sprayer, subsoiler).
Using equipment for managing crops, planting, ripping, spraying and transportation.
Setting implements, calibration, and handling during field operations.
Stripping and reassembling manual and animal-drawn tools and implements.
Maintaining and replacing worn-out implement parts.
Training for blacksmiths and artisans
Implements such as rippers and subsoilers are still hard to find in many areas. With
suitable training, blacksmiths and artisans can make them. Here are some topics to
cover in a course.
Blacksmithing problems that participants face in their workplace.
Essential blacksmithing equipment and tools for conservation agriculture.
Safety and organization in the workplace.
Lighting the forge, managing the fire, and heating metal to the correct temperature.
Blacksmithing operations and their application to conservation agriculture tools and
spare parts. Provide designs for each implement showing how to make them from
locally available materials.
Importance of quality and standards, and interchanging implement parts.
Making and using jigs and fixtures.
Finding and identifying useful scrap materials.
Setting up a rural blacksmith workshop.
Pricing and marketing of products.
Bankable smithing technology ideas.

Conservation Agriculture
Training for input dealers
Local shopkeepers and dealers may need training so they can sell the right item to
farmers, and so they can advise their customers on how to use them. Some topics they
may need training in:
Using equipment (so they can demonstrate to their customers).
Adjusting planters and sprayers so they deliver the right amount of seed, fertilizer or
herbicide.
Using herbicides correctly and safely.
Maintaining and repairing equipment.
Characteristics of crop varieties (so they can advise farmers on what crop and variety
to buy).
Storing and planting seeds.
Storing fertilizers and other agrochemicals safely.
Training for extension staff
Here are some topics to consider including in training courses for extension personnel –
in addition to the topics in the box on page 208.
Situation analysis
Analysis of local conditions for conservation agriculture, e.g.,
identifying problems, socioeconomic issues, SWOT (strengths–weaknesses–op-
portunities–threats) analysis.
Participatory approaches such as participatory rural appraisal.
Organizational capacity building
Training on leadership skills, participatory plan-
ning skills and participatory monitoring and evaluation.
Because conservation agriculture in-
volves a change in attitudes, it is im-
portant that participants come to
“own” the approach. This is best done
by enabling them to test technologies
themselves, empowering them to de-
cide what to try out, and through net-
working: providing them with ways
to get more information.
Joint training, with extension staff and
farmers learning together, is a good
way to spread the message of conser-
vation agriculture. The farmers hear
and understand certain issues, and the
extension officers others. During dis-
cussions, the two groups remember dif-

211
13
Encouraging Adaptation and Adoption
ferent issues, and they complement each other. The result is generally consid-
erably better than if the extension staff or farmers are trained separately. It is
quicker to pinpoint mistakes and correct them when working together.
Training on conservation agriculture is also needed in schools and universi-
ties. This means revising the curriculum and designing new courses for school-
children, agriculture students and trainee extension agents.
Extension
The government extension system provides essential advice to farmers on a
wide range of topics. Extension staff should understand and appreciate con-
servation agriculture, so they can support and promote it where appropriate.
This understanding is also important so they do not discourage farmers or
contradict the efforts of people promoting conservation agriculture. So exten-
sion agents should learn about conservation agriculture as part of their regu-
lar training.
Agents should promote conservation agriculture in their normal extension work
with farmers. They can do this in many ways. As with all types of extension
work, practical demonstrations in farmers’ fields are better than “chalk-and-
talk” in the classroom or village meeting room. The agents can help organize
farmer field schools – which are ideal opportunity for the agents themselves to
learn about the potential and intricacies of conservation agriculture. They can
also organize visits by farmer groups to farmers who are already practising
conservation agriculture, arrange for demonstrations of equipment such as
rippers and weed wipers, and facilitate supplies of seeds, herbicides and other
inputs that farmers may need.
Participatory extension approaches are important to reach farmers effectively.
These approaches enable everyone involved to work together: farmers, exten-
sion agents, local leaders, etc. These people can analyse their needs, problems
and opportunities. They can decide on their priorities, and explore possible
solutions to the problems. They can draw on their own knowledge and skills,
and add new ideas from outside. This strengthens their ability to solve other
problems they may face.
Demonstrations
Demonstrations are a valuable way for farmers to see a new technology for
themselves before they are ready to take the risk of trying it. Demonstrations
are best done on farmers’ fields, rather than on land owned by the extension
agency or research institute. It is important to select the right farmer coopera-
tors to demonstrate the technologies. They should be progressive and well-
respected in the community. Try to find someone who is already using many

212
Conservation Agriculture
of the components of conservation agriculture – for example, certified seed,
fertilizer and herbicides. This farmer will not have to make too many changes
to introduce other components of conservation agriculture, so may be more
willing to try them, and the demonstration is more likely to be a success. Avoid
absentee farmers or weekend farmers, as they will not have the efficient day-
to-day management skills on the farm to ensure success.
To start a demonstration programme in a village, select a few farmer coopera-
tors to work with. They should farm near each other so they can visit each
others’ fields easily – perhaps every 2 weeks. Since they live in the same vil-
lage, they can discuss the ins and outs of conservation agriculture easily, and
can reassure and learn from one another. A group of 5–8 farmers attracts
more attention from others than if only one or two farmers are testing the
technology. The extension agent can focus effort in this village, rather than
trying to cover too wide an area. If the agent has only one demonstration a
season, he or she may take several years to learn from the mistakes made.
The members of a farmer field school (see below) may welcome the opportu-
nity of hosting demonstrations.
When first introducing conservation agriculture, choose villages that are eas-
ily accessible. This makes supervision easier, allows more people to come to see
the demonstrations, and makes it easy for input suppliers to deliver what the
farmers need on time. Once the community has adopted the approach on a
wide scale, the agent can move on to neighbouring areas – inviting farmers
there to visit successful conservation agriculture fields in the initial village.
Farmer field
schools
A farmer field school is a partnership
between farmers and extension per-
sonnel, and perhaps the private sec-
tor and researchers. It consists of a
group of up to 25 farmers who have
identified a problem and agree to meet
with a facilitator to discover solutions
to it. The farmers meet regularly – per-
haps every one or two weeks –
throughout the cropping season, in
their own fields. They learn by doing:
they observe what is happening in the
fields, analyse and prioritize problems,

Encouraging Adaptation and Adoption
Farmer field schools in western Kenya
The first delicate lilac blossoms of water hyacinth spelled disaster for the fisherfolk of
Kusa in western Kenya. The aquatic weed had invaded the Nyando District shore of Lake
Victoria, choking their fishing grounds. The fishers were forced to start farming to earn a
living.
But their problems did not end there. The rain is unreliable, and erosion is severe. AIDS
has taken a heavy toll on the younger generation, causing a shortage of labour.
In search of solutions, RELMA (the Regional Land Management Unit, now part of ICRAF)
sponsored 20 farmers to go on a study tour in a neighbouring district. There, they learned
about conservation agriculture, and they decided to form a group to use these methods
on their own land. The farmer field school approach offered an attractive, affordable way
for them to learn and test the new practices.
In 2003, the first year, an agronomist from the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI)
branch in Kisii guided ten field-school groups. Each group had about 20 members. Each
group selected a “model farmer” to host the main demonstrations and to take responsi-
bility for guiding the other farmers. The model farmers learned how to use the Magoye
ripper and tested two cover crops, lablab and mucuna, on small plots.
They tested five different conservation agriculture practices and adapted them to the local
conditions. They liked using planting basins for growing fodder crops such as Napier and
bana grass.
Training in the general principles of farmer field schools put the Kusa farmers at the
centre of the learning process. This essential step was followed with on-farm trials to test
intercropping or relay planting of the new cover crops with maize, residue management,
and minimum tillage.
The farmer groups also worked with Ministry of Agriculture extension staff to test new
varieties of maize and beans. The field schools made the extension officers’ work easier
because it allowed them to try the new varieties in a structured setting.
The farmer field schools cost outside agencies fairly little. Their main inputs were trans-
port for the senior trainer from KARI, seed for cover crops, and four Magoye ripper/sub-
soilers imported from Zambia.
There was not enough cover crop seed in the first year. One model farmer, Mr Owalla,
harvested enough lablab seed to sell (at KSh 50 per kg) at least two kilograms of seed to
each of the other members of his group. Farmers have now planted at least 50 acres to
lablab, so there is plenty of seed to go round.
There are still challenges with promoting this approach. There is no source of Magoye
rippers in Kenya. Local welders in Kusa tried to make them, but could not find the high
quality steel needed.
A strong local organization is needed to organize such field schools. In this case, the
Kusa Community Development Society performed this role, but such organizations do
not exist everywhere.
But perhaps the main challenge to scaling up the use of conservation agriculture in
places like Kusa is the lack of skilled, experienced facilitators like the one from KARI. His
ability to motivate and train farmers is based on several years of work with the farmer field
school approach, coupled with a strong knowledge of conservation agriculture practices.

Conservation Agriculture
The emphasis is on farmers discovering answers rather than listening to lec-
tures by an extensionist or researcher. The farmers learn by themselves and
from each other.
Farmer field schools are an ideal venue to introduce a new approach such as
conservation agriculture. The farmers can see and test a new technology be-
fore adopting it. The field schools can draw on the skills and knowledge of
outsiders, such as researchers and technical advisers. These can advise on how
to solve specific problems. The field schools are also ideal for doing research to
adapt conservation agriculture techniques to suit local conditions.
The field schools can be combined with other approaches to extension. For
example, the facilitator may arrange for the field school members to visit a
research institute or farmers in a neighbouring district, and to host their own
groups of visitors. The group’s experimental plots make ideal locations for dem-
onstrations.
Farmer champions
It is usually possible to find several farmers in an area who have tested and
developed some sort of conservation agriculture on their own, however in-
complete. Other farmers may be eager to try conservation agriculture: they
like to keep improving their farm, and they have heard about conservation
agriculture somehow.
From drug dealer to champion and trainer
By the time he reached his 30s, Molahlei was a dubious character. He would grow mari-
juana on his farm in Lesotho, and sell it over the border in South Africa. But in 2003 he was
introduced to conservation agriculture. He saw its dramatic potential to increase his yield
and income. He soon became a farmer champion in his area. His harvests rose by an
amazing 1000%.
Molahlei is now an executive member of his community’s conservation agriculture com-
mittee. He cannot give you a long CV of academic qualifications… but when he works with
a group of farmers, you realize this is one of the best farmers you will ever meet. He is
proud of being a farmer.
Molahlei and other farmers have put a series of comic skits together to convey the ideas
of conservation agriculture. The skits are hilarious: the audience rolls on the floor with
laughter.  When they have loosened up the audience in this way, Molahlei and his friends
start to teach them practical things.
This is one example of a farmer who became a champion, and who is training people far
more effectively than his own teacher did.

Encouraging Adaptation and Adoption
These farmers are a precious resource for conservation agriculture programmes.
They are highly motivated, and may have already adapted conservation agri-
culture principles to local conditions. They can be excellent partners for exten-
sion agents and researchers to develop further options. Many farmers are happy
to share their experiences with fellow farmers.
These farmers can become champions of conservation agriculture in their com-
munities. They can become magnificent trainers and motivators, through their
enthusiasm and success. They also have the unique ability to convince politi-
cians and policy makers about the value of this approach.
Extension agencies and conservation agriculture programmes should help these
farmer champions develop links with other farmer champions, and with farmer
organizations and service organizations. They may need help to experiment
further – for example, to obtain inputs or to cover the risk of an experiment
failing. They may also need assistance in documenting and sharing their find-
ings with other farmers.
Farmer-to-farmer extension
Extension agents are few and generally overworked. They have to serve large
numbers of farmers, cover large areas, and deal with a vast range of topics.
Plus, many have only limited direct experience in farming, so farmers natu-
rally view them with some scepticism.
Farmers themselves can make excellent extension workers. They have practi-
cal experience and credibility, and with a little support, can train their fellow
farmers in conservation agriculture, organize farmer groups, arrange activi-
ties such as field visits, facilitate farmer field schools, and so on. Farmer facili-
tators should not be seen as an alternative to the regular extension service;
rather, they complement and reinforce the work of extension staff. Well-moti-
vated farmer champions can make excellent facilitators.
Farmers’ organizations
To succeed with conservation agriculture, farmers need to work together. Get-
ting training or credit, buying equipment or seeds, setting up small trials of
new techniques, learning – these are all easier in a group. Some things are
possible only if people collaborate – banning burning of crop residues, for ex-
ample, or establishing rules on grazing.
Local institutions such as community organizations or farmer groups may be
able to support the introduction of conservation agriculture. Such groups may
already exist, even though they may not focus on farming. For example, a
community organization may enable credit, health or schooling. But such an
institution may be able to add a conservation agriculture focus – perhaps by

216
Conservation Agriculture
creating a special committee among interested members. Otherwise, it may be
necessary for farmers to create a new organization. Extension agents and de-
velopment workers can assist them to do this.
Whether old or new, local organizations may need outside help so they can
support their members adopt conservation agriculture. They may be able to
benefit from technical training, participation in field days and exchange visits,
linkages with other groups or institutions, and leadership development.
Schools and churches
Schools and churches can play a key role in promoting conservation agricul-
ture.
Teachers can teach conservation agriculture as part of the regular curriculum,
both in the classroom and on the school farm. They can organize agriculture
clubs to involve children in growing food for the school.
Churches are also important promoters. An active priest or pastor can inspire
an entire congregation to try out conservation agriculture as a way of lifting
Farming God’s Way
One church in Lesotho teaches conservation agriculture as “Farming God’s Way” – farm-
ing alongside nature, and not against it.
The pastor uses questions and answers like these to challenge people to start to think
differently about agriculture:
Who is the best farmer in the whole world? (Answer: God.) (Genesis 2:8)
We are made in God’s image, therefore we are co-creators with God. (Genesis 1:27)
Would you like to become one of the best farmers in the world?
If God is the best farmer in the world, we have to learn from Him.
Have you ever seen God’s angels, tractors or animals coming from heaven to plough
up the soil?
The pastor invites his congregation to look for the lessons they see in nature, and bring
the same principles to their farms:
Nature does not turn over the soil, so you should not have to either.
Nature produces a thick blanket of mulch on the ground. Your soil needs such a
blanket (cover crop, mulch).
Nature has a diversity of plants. So rotate crops on your farm.
“Learn from the best farmer in the world”, the pastor urges, “and you have the potential to
become one of the best farmers in the world.”

Encouraging Adaptation and Adoption
themselves out of poverty. Many Africans are very religious. They easily make
the link between God, nature and good farming practices. Churches are ideal
venues for promoting conservation agriculture. They are closely involved in
the community, and have strong networks throughout the country. It is their
responsibility to address poverty.
Pastors can draw on various passages of the Bible to support their points. For
example, Genesis (Gen 1:26) says that God has set us as stewards of creation,
and not to destroy it.
Other ways to share experiences
Because conservation agriculture has so many aspects, sharing experiences is
important so farmers can continue to learn from one another. But sharing
does not happen by itself. It has to be facilitated.
School children promote conservation agriculture
A few banana plants and one teacher’s determination have had big results in a school in
central Kenya.
Mr Githiomi, an agriculture teacher at Gathunguru primary school, aimed to introduce
pupils to intensive farming using the school’s 2.5 acre garden. At first he tried several
crops using conventional farming methods, but yields declined each year.
Then in 2001, he attended a field day on conservation agriculture organized by Makuyu
Divisional Agricultural Office. Mr Githiomi was impressed. He explained conservation
agriculture to members of the school’s 4K Club (part of a national youth organization).
The school’s head teacher helped him buy 50 tissue-culture banana suckers from Jomo
Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. The club planted them in the school
garden, using cover crops and other conservation agriculture principles.
The fruit yield was excellent. Many more children and several teachers joined the club.
The improved soil fertility stimulated the growth of many new banana suckers. Mr Githiomi
and the club members gave some suckers to the children to plant in their parent’s gar-
dens back home. Some of the teachers and members of the Parent-Teachers Associa-
tion were also given suckers to plant.
That year, the club added kidney beans, French beans, cowpeas, lablab, green gram and
sweet potatoes as cover crops to the banana garden.
The club later decided that parents could take banana suckers but should donate maize
grain to the school in return. This maize is milled and used to make school meals. For the
first time, the school is able to provide lunches for its pupils.
The head teacher also decided to invite the local extension agent to teach new banana
management skills to the teachers and children.
The Gathunguru school is not unique. Similar initiatives in four primary schools in Uganda
through a Sida-funded programme called “Farm-level Applied Research Methods Re-
search” also had a tremendous multiplier effect.

218
Conservation Agriculture
Here are some ways to encourage and enable people to share:
Field days and visits to fields where conservation agriculture is being
used or tested.
Fairs, shows and competitions are good ways to attract a lot of attention
to conservation agriculture.
Exchange visits and exposure tours among distant farmers’ groups. These
may last several days; the visitors may stay overnight in the host village or
nearby.
Yearly meetings of farmer-innovators, community leaders and extension
officers. These meetings can present (as posters or orally) experiences and
the results of experiments. Inputs such as seeds, products or implements
can also be displayed.
Videos can include interviews with farmers, and show various parts of
the cropping cycle and farming operations that visitors cannot see during
a single visit.
Drama and songs, like the comedy skits used by Molahlei and his friends
in Lesotho.
Farmers’ organizations in Uganda
Farmers’ organizations in Bisheshe sub-county, in Mbarara District, are promoting con-
servation agriculture. The organizations are organized in a hierarchy, from community
level up to parish, to the sub-county, to the district and national levels.
Unlike most hierarchies, this one works from the bottom up. Groups of farmers in each
village with the same problems and interests come together as “common interest
groups”. They pool their efforts to find ways of solving their problems. These groups each
focus on one of range of topics: trees, livestock, horticulture, and soil and water conser-
vation. Conservation agriculture is one of these topics.
The chairs of the various common interest groups are members of coordination com-
mittees at the parish and sub-county levels. Other committee members include civic
leaders, opinion leaders and extension staff. The committee coordinates activities of the
various common interest groups, and links them with service providers, extension agen-
cies, NGOs and community organizations.
The common interest groups inform the parish coordination committee of their produc-
tion problems and training needs. The committee then develops a parish action plan to
respond to the various groups’ needs. It identifies community facilitators (interest-group
members who have been trained in the appropriate skills) to provide training. If the facili-
tators lack the right skills, the committee asks the sub-county committee to find an appro-
priate service provider.
The interest groups are members of a parish-level inter-group association. This asso-
ciation helps mobilize resources for savings-and-credit schemes and marketing. The
associations took over the training and supervision of the common interest groups in
December 2004, when ULAMP, a donor-funded project supporting them, ended.

Growing tomatoes as a business
Hopolang is a young farmer in Tebellong, in the mountains of Lesotho. He farms an acre
of land that his father gave him. He, his wife and small child live in a small house,
measuring only about 4 x 5 m. He has little chance of finding work nearby, and he does not
want to leave his family to look for work in the city.
Hopolang does not have much. But he is willing to work. He was introduced to conserva-
tion agriculture, and someone gave him some pipes so he could water his land.
He has taken the principles of conservation agriculture a step further than he was taught.
He figured that if you can grow maize this way, you can also grow tomatoes. So he planted
about 3000 tomato plants, along with other vegetables such as cabbage. In one season
alone, he was able to sell $1000 worth of tomatoes.
This young farmer has changed his single acre into a living example that conservation
agriculture works, and that it can be a profitable business.

Question-and-answer sessions with researchers, extension specialists or
farmer champions.
Open meetings (meaning everybody is invited!). These are a good oppor-
tunity for farmers, extension agents, researchers and others to share their
experiences and motivate local people and technicians about conservation
agriculture.
Radio and television programmes can raise awareness about conserva-
tion agriculture among farmers, extension agents, development workers
and decision makers throughout the country. Local community radio can
help spread the news about conservation agriculture and enable farmers
to share experiences with other people in the area.
With all these activities, it is important to follow them with concrete activities
to make sure the momentum created does not evaporate.
Farming as a business
Conservation agriculture offers farmers an opportunity to see their farms in a
new way: as a business. Extension agents and development workers should
encourage them to do this.
Conservation agriculture offers this opportunity because it allows farmers to
increase their yields, produce more than they need for subsistence, and grow
new crops they can sell. It can offer a market and trading orientation, and
enables farmers to find a pathway out of poverty.
To be successful, many farmers will need to change not only their attitudes.
They will also need new skills – in choosing crops to grow for the market, in
sorting, grading and marketing their produce, in post-harvest processing, and
so on.

220
Conservation Agriculture
They will also need to develop links with traders, transport providers, input
suppliers, and so on. They may need to organize themselves into groups to
enable them to obtain supplies and services they need at an acceptable price,
and to sell their crops in sufficient bulk to get a good price in turn.
Here are some ideas for how farmers can treat their farms as a business:
Choose the right crops Farmers should consider growing high-value crops
such as leguminous fodders and vegetables. They might grow a variety of
crops to overcome oversupplied seasonal markets.
Organize A group of farmers can organize to buy inputs such as seed
and fertilizers in bulk, and save on the purchase price and on transport
costs. As a group, they can negotiate for loans with a bank or credit institu-
tion. They can store produce and sell it more easily than as individuals –
perhaps at a more distant market where prices are better.
Get information Farmers often do not know how much their produce is
worth. As a group, it is easier to find and share information about what
crops are in demand, where to sell them, and at what price. Groups can
also get information about new varieties and new techniques more easily.
Add value Farmers should consider how to add value to their produce.
This may mean something as simple as sorting and grading. It may also
mean planting at a different time (to avoid the peak harvest time when
prices are low), storing the produce until prices recover, arranging packing
and transport so perishable produce arrives at the market quickly and in
good condition, or processing produce to improve its storability or increase
its value.
Keep records Few small-scale farmers keep records of their crops or what
they buy and sell. Good records are vital if farmers are to treat their farms
as a business. Without records, they cannot tell how much profit they are
making, or whether they would make more money by switching crops or
adopting a new technology. See Chapter 11 for more.
Multiple stakeholder partnerships
Conservation agriculture is not “business as usual”. It requires a number of
radical changes in the way farming is done. Farmers must make some of these
changes themselves. Others are needed at the community level (for example,
organizing groups). Others involve input retailers (to sell herbicides, seeds and
equipment), NGOs (to provide training, help with organizational issues, study
tours, etc.), credit institutions, government agencies such as extension and re-
search services, etc. And some may even require linking with institutions abroad
– for example, to import no-till equipment.
This means the success of conservation agriculture will depend on many dif-
ferent people and organizations. It is important to form partnerships to pro-
mote conservation agriculture. Farmers, farmers’ organizations and commu-

221
13
Encouraging Adaptation and Adoption
Roles of stakeholders
Here are two examples of stakeholder partnerships, highlighting the roles played by each
member.
Example 1:
Conservation agriculture equipment
Farmers and extension staff test the equipment.
Researchers help design the equipment tests, and advise the equipment manufac-
turers.
Manufacturers and distributors attend field days to see how farmers are doing.
They discuss the equipment with them, how to use it properly, and check any poten-
tial improvements to the design.
Credit institutions provide loans so farmers can buy the equipment.
Government services may need to provide subsidies to enable farmers to buy the
equipment.
Example 2:
Field days
Conservation agriculture farmers host the field days, describe their experiences
and answer questions.
Other farmers who have not yet tried conservation agriculture listen and ask ques-
tions.
Extension staff help the hosts get ready for the field day – e.g., by helping them make
flip charts. They also help prepare the logistics: transportation, refreshments, taking
notes, etc.
Researchers come to learn about conservation agriculture, listen to farmers’ experi-
ences, and provide technical information.
Community leaders, project personnel and staff of supporting institutions help
mobilize farmers and give a formal character to the field day.
Private input retailers may be invited if products they sell have been used in the
fields visited. They may cover expenses such as for signs, stationery and refresh-
ments.
Politicians may be invited to learn about conservation agriculture and the type of
support needed from government.
nity organizations should, of course, be key actors in these partnerships. They
are, after all, the ultimate beneficiaries of efforts to promote conservation agri-
culture. But they need to make sure that promotional activities respond clearly
to their needs, and take into account their situation, knowledge and beliefs.
Extension staff and development workers are also key. They should be involved
in almost every conservation agriculture-related activity.
Other stakeholders should work alongside them, depending on the nature of
the activity.

222
Conservation Agriculture
Small-scale entrepreneurs and private
business
The success of conservation agriculture depends on the availability of the right
equipment (subsoilers, weed wipers, etc.) and inputs (such as herbicides and
cover crop seeds). This offers opportunities to manufacturers and input sup-
pliers to make these supplies available.
But there is a “chicken-and-egg” situation: manufacturers and dealers are
unwilling to produce or stock equipment and inputs unless they are sure there
is a demand for them. At the same time, farmers cannot buy these items if they
are not on sale.
Development organizations can help by demonstrating the new techniques to
farmers, liaising with manufacturers and dealers, extending credit to suppli-
ers so they can invest in equipment or stocks, and guaranteeing initial orders
for equipment (or subsidizing their price) until the demand has been estab-
lished.
See Chapter 10 for more on input supplies and equipment manufacture.
Policy support
Agricultural policies can do much to promote conservation agriculture. In coun-
tries such as Brazil where conservation agriculture has been widely adopted,
such policy support was vital.
Agricultural policies should focus on
improving access to market, credit and
input supplies, and rural infrastruc-
ture. They should support the devel-
opment of farmers’ groups. Incentives
should encourage diversification and
conservation agriculture practices, es-
pecially during the transition phase
from conventional farming to conser-
vation practices.
Appropriate product pricing can raise
productivity per unit land and reduce
pressure on marginal regions.
Inadequate policies and subsidies that
support conventional practices might
discourage farmers from adopting con-
servation agriculture. Land use and
customary rights must also be taken
Secure tenure is important if people are to
invest in their land

223
13
Encouraging Adaptation and Adoption
into account. They may have to be adapted to favour conservation agricul-
ture.
Subsidies and other incentives can also support the spread of conservation
agriculture. Subsidies may be justified because the government wishes to en-
sure national food security and prevent erosion and pollution.
Policies must guarantee farmers long-term rights to the land they farm. If they
do not have secure tenure, they will not be willing to invest in improvements
to the land through conservation agriculture.
Governments must also ensure that extension services and other agencies sup-
port and promote conservation agriculture. This may involve:
Promoting research on conservation agriculture.
Changing the curricula in extension training institutes and universities.
Building conservation agriculture into the extension programme.
Ensuring that the extension service becomes more farmer-centred – for
example, to encourage collaboration with NGOs and facilitate farmer field
schools.
