A urn forestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Upanda

Technical Handbook No.21
Preface
This handbook arose out of a request from the forest department staff in Uganda
to assist in the production of agroforestry extension materials. The first planning
meeting was held on 5th June 1998, with representatives from the Forestry
Department, Uganda; Forest Research Institute (FORI); CARE International;
Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries (MAAIF), ICRAF and
RELMA. At this first meeting the target group/recipients of the materials;
languages; prioritization of agro-ecological zones of Uganda for which the
materials would be developed; key agroforestry technologies in those zones;
format of publication and projected contents was discussed.
The bananaâcoffee zone is a terminology describing one of Ugandas six agro-
ecological zones. Though banana and coffee are the principle staple and cash
crops in the zone, the zone is characterized by a diverse and complex farming
system. This text focuses on the integrated role and nature of agroforestry in this
complex system. This text does not address banana or coffee production which
are extensively covered in other specialist publications.
The banana-coffee zone is situated in southern central Uganda, stretching from
Bushenyi in the west, to Tororo in the east. The other agro-ecological zones of
Uganda are the: montane system; cattle corridor; cereals based systems and pure
pastoral system (map p. 3).
Two RELMA fellowships were allocated for the initial fieldwork to collect
information on the technologies in the banana-coffee zone. These were
completed by the end of 1998 and the first drafts circulated. Additional field work
was commissioned thereafter to develop cases study materials of farmers'
experiences and practices in implementing agroforestry in the banana-coffee
zone. The final version of the handbook was thoroughly reviewed at a
stakeholders workshop held in Masaka, Uganda in October 1999. Farmers,
government and NGO extension workers, researchers, authors, and artists were
present. The inputs from the workshop significantly improved the quality and
scope of this final text and the inputs of all the participants of the Masaka
workshop are appreciated. The authors of the handbook are:
I. Oluka-Akileng
Acting Deputy Commissioner, Forest Department, Uganda;
J. Esegu
Director of Forest Research Institute (FORI), Uganda;
Alice A. Kaudia
Assistant Director, Service Programme, Kenya Forestry
Research Institute (KEFRI); and

The principle beneficiaries of this text are designed to be frontline extension
workers and farmers. In accordance with this objective, local names of tree
species are the preferred entry point for technology descriptions. Scientific names
are also provided in the text. For easy reference however, a glossary at the end of
the book provides a full list of local scientific names. In a recent review of the
utilization of RELMA sponsored extension materials in Uganda, it was
demonstrated that farmers and extension workers preferred materials produced
in local languages. Though extension workers would be satisfied with versions in
English they still requested copies in vernacular to assist them in their training
sessions with farmers. Copies of this text are therefore to be produced in English
and Luganda, the predominant language in the banana-coffee zone.
RELMA and the authors sincerely hope that this handbook will facilitate the
enhancement of the contribution of agroforestry to sustainable rural livelihoods
in central Uganda. The authors and RELMA would welcome any feedback from
persons or organisations who use this handbook, as such feedback contributes to
the continual upgrading and improvement of extension publications produced by
RELMA and its partners.

Foreword
Introductory Remarks to the Workshop for Pre-Testing the Agroforestry
Extension Manual for Farmers in the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
In 1993 the Rio Conference brought public awareness about critical global
environment issues. In 1994 the Cairo Conference brought the high population
growth problem to public attention. Less publicised, but very critical to the future
of humankind, is the need to greatly improve agricultural productivity. These
three interlocked issuesâenvironmental degradation, the high rate of population
increase particularly in developing countries, and the need to enhance
agricultural productivityâconstitute the triple global challenge for the 21st
Century. The core of this challenge is: How is the world going to feed the high
population without inflicting damage on the environment that is already under
great stress?
Agroforestry as a land-use system is known to contribute to both increased
productivity and environmental sustainability particularly for the small-scale
farmers in the banana-coffee farming system in Uganda. This workshop
involving farmers to pre-test and evaluate the Agroforestry Extension manual for
farmers in the banana-coffee zone, is timely, relevant, appropriate, and practical.
It is timely because it relates to similar activities within the National Agricultural
Research Organisation (NARO) and all the Institutes under NARO. It is relevant
because it calls for mobilising the full range of both technology generation and
technology transfer endeavours to address the needs of the households at the
local levels. It is appropriate because it contributes to poverty eradication which
is topmost priority for the government of Uganda. And it is practical because it
is participatory and calls for the most effective collaboration among all
stakeholders -technology users (farmers), technology generators (researchers) and
technology transfers (extensionists) to produce a suitable manual on agroforestry
for use by the farmers in the banana-coffee zone of Uganda.

Introduction
Agriculture supports livelihoods of most people in Uganda, especially the rural-
based farmers. It is the policy of the government to improve production through
modernisation of agriculture. To achieve this, the government has adopted a
number of strategies which include:
â¢ Promoting specialisation in production,
â¢ Modernisation of rural economy,
â¢ Promoting improved agricultural technologies,
â¢ Promoting profit-driven investment activities (commercialisation),
â¢ Promoting diversification of land use such as through adoption of
agroforestry,
â¢ Control of land fragmentation, and
â¢ Promoting the growing of high value crops.
Agroforestry has been practised by farmers in Uganda for many generations. It
has been part and parcel of their traditional production systems. However,
agroforestry research started in the country around the mid 1980s. Since then,
some of the technologies generated have been promoted and passed on to
farmers for adoption. Effective promotion and dissemination of agroforestry has
been limited by several factors notably inadequate number of extension staff, lack
of suitable extension materials and limited support resources and facilities.
Development agencies concerned with promotion of agroforestry and related
farming practices have recognised the gap in availability of suitable extension
materials. Though various programmes have produced subject specific materials,
a comprehensive manual on agroforestry to serve needs of farmers and
agroforestry extension staff has been lacking. This handbook has been prepared
as one of the strategies to address the lack of suitable agroforestry extension
materials for farmers and within agroforestry extension services in Uganda.
Much of the contents of this handbook is drawn from farmers' experiences and
practices. During preparations for writing the manual, discussions were held with
farmers in several districts in the banana-coffee zone of Uganda including
Mukono, Mpigi, Masaka, Mbarara, Iganga and Jinja. Through informal
discussions with farmers, observation and photographic documentation,
information was gathered. Additional information was obtained from interviews
with researchers, published materials and other relevant documents. The final
draft of the manual was reviewed at a workshop which brought together farmers,

research and development practitioners from government and non-govermental
organizations.
The handbook is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 is introduction. Chapter 2
presents a description of the banana-coffee region of Uganda. In Chapter 3, the
definition of agroforestry, the benefits of agroforestry and related issues are
described. In Chapter 4, sources of seeds and other tree propagation materials,
raising of seedlings and management of grown trees are discussed.
Chapter 5 presents and discusses the agroforestry practices common in the
banana-coffee zone. Pest and disease control in relation to trees is the subject of
Chapter 6.

The Banana-Coffee Zone
Introduction
The banana-coffee zone covers around 13,000 sq. km of Uganda. This is mainly
in areas that were originally covered by evergreen forests. The forests have been
largely cleared and the land planted with bananas and coffee. The farming
practices in this zone are based on bananas as the main food crop and Robusta
coffee as the main cash crop. Bananas are grown both for sale and home
consumption. Many other types of crops are grown by farmers together with the
main crops. These include cassava, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, maize, beans and
indigenous vegetables. The pattern of growing other crops together with banana
and coffee varies from farm to farm.

Geographic location
The banana-coffee system is located in the southern region of the country,
around the shores of Lake Victoria between longitudes 31Â°E to 34Â°E and latitudes
1Â°N and 1Â°S. Figure 1 shows the location of the zone.
The population is about 3 million people. The average density is 140 persons per
square km. The annual population growth rate is 3%. The area has a good
infrastructure. Good roads link most of the zone to market centres. The major
towns of Kampala, Masaka, Jinja and Mbarara lie within this region. The
average land holding per family varies between 1-3 ha.
Climate
Most of the area receives rain in two seasons. The "first rains" fall between
March and May. The "second rains" are from August to November.
The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1000mm to 2250mm. Sesse Islands
receives the highest rainfall of over 2000mm per annum. Average annual
maximum temperature lies between 22.5Â°C and 27Â°C. Average minimum
temperatures vary from about 18Â°C to 23Â°C. Average relative humidity ranges
between 80 and 95 percent. The banana-coffee area receives a lot of rain and is
generally warm and humid. The climatic conditions have favoured growth of
agroforestry trees adapted to warm and humid climate. Such trees include Musizi
(Maesopsis eminii), Muvule (Milicia excelsa), and Albizia species.
Relief and soils
The banana-coffee zone consists of undulating terrain with flat-topped hills, large
papyrus valleys and extensive river systems. Cultivation is mainly done on the
gentle slopes.
The soils are generally deep and low in nutrients. Sandy deep-red and relatively
fertile soils commonly occur on the uplands. The upland soils drain easily and
have lost a lot of nutrients because the nutrients get washed down by rain. Poorly
drained and dark soils occur in the lowlands where papyrus marsh and swamps
are common. The lowlands are located around the northern and south-western
shores of Lake Victoria.

Technical Handbook No.21
Vegetation
The vegetation of the area is comprised of tropical high forests, forest plantations,
wood lots, bush-land, grassland, and wetlands. Medium altitude, moist evergreen
forests occur in well watered areas of Mpigi, Mukono and Masaka districts.
Medium altitude, moist, semi-deciduous and secondary forests occur in the
northern lake shores including Mabira forest. Forest savannah mosaics occupy
areas that were originally forested but have undergone repeated cultivation,
cutting and burning. Elephant grass and other grasses are predominant.
Wetlands, comprising seasonally and permanent swamps mainly of papyrus and
palms occupy the low-lying areas.
Land-use practices
The banana-coffee zone is characterised by intensive smallholder production of
subsistence and cash crops. Robusta coffee is the main cash crop. Individual
households are densely scattered over the zone. Households typically own 1-3 ha.
farm holdings. Usually, households with such small land-holdings own land under
the mailo system. This system is discussed in Chapter 3 of this handbook. The
households grow crops in a variety of mixtures. Crops commonly grown in mixed
cropping pattern include beans, cassava, sweet potatoes, yams, soya beans, maize,
pumpkins, groundnuts, cabbages, tomatoes, pineapples, pawpaw, onions and
other indigenous vegetables. Food crops are grown either at the edges or under
canopies of bananas and coffee or in small isolated patches. Cassava grown
between mounds of sweet potatoes, cassava inter-cropped with groundnuts and
isolated stands of arrow-roots between beans, and scattered maize are common
cropping patterns on periphery of banana-coffee fields. Isolated fruit trees are
also common within the banana-coffee fields. A few farmers grow tea, coffee,
sugar cane and vanilla on a large scale.
Fruit trees such as avocados, passion, jackfruit, guava, citrus and pawpaws are
grown as cash crops. The fruits are also harvested for household consumption.
Cattle are kept basically for milk, meat and occasionally cash. Cattle are also
increasingly kept to provide manure, which in some cases is sold. Goats and pigs
are kept for sale and home consumption.
Over the years, the quality of soils has declined because of repeated cultivation.
Other land use practices like agroforestry have been introduced to improve yields
of crops. In the following chapter, agroforestry and some of the benefits are
discussed.

Agroforestry as a Sustainable Form of
Land Use
The definition of agroforestry
Definition of agroforestry in 1970s/1990s
The concept, definition and scope of agroforestry have changed over time
as 'outsiders' have come to recognise the greater role of trees and tree
products in farmers livelihoods.
Previous definition
Agroforestry is a collective term for land use sytems and practices where
woody perennials are deliberately integrated with crops and/or animals on
the same land management unit. The integration can be either in spatial
mixture or in temporal sequence. There are normally both ecological and
economic interactions between the woody and non-woody components in
agroforestry. (Manualfor ICRAF Board of TrusteesâSeptember, 1992.)
Current Definition
"Agroforestry refers to a dynamic, ecologically based natural resources
management system that, through integration of trees in farms and in the
landscape, diversifies and sustains production for increased social, economic
and environmental benefits for land use at all levels." (Leakey, Agroforestry
Today, September 1998).

Technical Handbook No.21
Agroforestry has been extensively practiced by farmers for many years. However,
because land holdings have become small, it is necessary to introduce
technologies for intensive land use. New agroforestry technologies can contribute
to intensification and enhancement of agricultural production.
Farmers nowadays leave land to rest for shorter periods. Repeated cultivation and
over-grazing of land without using methods that can maintain and improve
quality of soil has led to degradation of land. Fertility of soils has declined. High
yields can no longer be obtained.
Agroforestry in Uganda
The definition of agroforestry indicates that farmers in Uganda have been
practising agroforestry for along time. The growing of bananas together with
coffee and trees like Albizia chinensis. Mugavu (Albizia coriaria), Mutuba (Fiats
naialmsis). Nsambya (Markhamia luted). Musizi (Maesopsis eminii) and fruit trees is an
agroforestry" practice.
There are additional agroforestry- practices, not yet commonly practised by
farmers that address poor soil conditions, production of woodfuel and other tree-
based needs. In the following chapter, a selection of the practices are described.
One of the main factors that influence farmers' choice of agroforestry practices
is land tenure. This is discussed in the following section.
Land tenure
Land tenure has implications for farmers' decision to grow long term crops like
trees. There are different types of land tenure. The mailo type of land tenure is
common in the Central and Western Uganda. In the mailo land tenure system,
usually absentee landlords own land but allow small-scale farmers (tenants) to use
the land. Most of these farmers living in and cultivating the mailo land have no
legal titles to the land. They only have the right to use the land based on an
agreement between them and the owners. Farmers who cultivate mailo land are
known as kibanja owners. The 1995 constitution however states that land belongs
to the people. The implication of this constitutional statement to ownership of
land by small-scale farmers without legal title is not yet clear and is still to be fully
implemented.
Leasehold is another common type of land tenure. In this case, the occupants
have land titles over a specific lease period. The third type of land tenure is
7

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Â£one of Uganda
customary. In this case, land is obtained through inheritance. An individual owns
inherited land and it may be passed-on to descendants. Generally, there are no
indications of insecurity of tenure of land and trees grown on mailo land. Some
agroforestry shrubs grow fast and can be harvested even within one year after
planting. Where security of land tenure is not assured, farmers should grow such
shrubs. On the other hand, trees which take along time to mature can still be
grown even under the mailo system because one can claim compensation in the
event of eviction.
Ownership of land is therefore an important condition and affects patterns of
land use for agroforestry. But before describing agroforestry practices in detail, we
need to know something on how seeds for raising good tree planting materials can
be obtained. This is the subject of the following chapter. The chapter also
presents some general practices for managing trees.

Propagation and Management of
Agroforestry Trees
Introduction
There are three methods of raising planting material of trees. These are from
wildings, seed and from vegetative parts of plants. To raise good quality tree
planting material, it is important to identify good seed sources and individual
trees from which seeds and other propagation materials can be collected. In this
chapter we discuss how to collect, handle and process seed and other propagation
materials; and how to raise seedlings from seed.

Seed collection and handling
Sources of seed
Seeds should be collected from trees growing over a large area and in a similar
ecological zone. The place where the seed is collected should be as similar as
possible to the place where the seedlings will be planted. To obtain good quality
seed, the following factors should be carefully considered:
â¢ Collect seed from vigorous, healthy, mature trees of good form;
â¢ Do not collect seed from isolated trees; and
â¢ Collect seed from a minimum of 10 trees spaced at least 100m apart. As a
rule of thumb, the distance between the trees should be twice the tree
height.
Generally, the type of product desired from a tree determines the characteristics
to be looked for in a mother tree. Table 1 presents a summary of typical
characteristics for mother trees for specific types of tree products.
Seed collection methods
There are three common seed collection methods. These are:
â¢ Collection from fallen fruits or seeds
This is a simple method but it requires careful selection of the fruits or
seeds. Fruits or seeds that have been attacked by disease or pests should not
be collected. It is advisable to know the period of heavy fruiting or seeding.
When this period is known, a canvas material or mat can be placed under
the trees to prevent seeds from gaining direct contact with the ground.
â¢ Collection from standing trees
This is a relatively difficult method and requires climbing into the crown to
pick fruits or seeds. It is advisable to use this method if one is sure that the
tree has strong branches that can provide support during climbing. Ladders,
ropes and hooked poles can also be used to collect seeds from the crown.
â¢ Collection from crowns of trees
This is a simple method because the seeds or seed bearing fruits are easily
accessible from the ground. When harvesting trees for their products, it is
advisable to harvest them when they are bearing mature seeds. In this way,
the seeds can be used for raising seedlings for planting.

This is the separation of seeds from the fruits. The method used depends on the
nature of the fruit. Some fruits need de-pulping; others need drying until seeds
11

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
become detached from the fruit. Others need the use of a knife. Some fruits,
mainly nuts do not require extraction but are stored or sown as fruits. The
extracted seed should be cleaned by separating healthy sound seeds from empty
and non-viable seeds, de-winging seeds and grading seed by size and appearance.
Grading seed is recommended but may not be necessary if only a small amount
is processed for direct use. In Table 2 the seed processing and treatment methods
for common agroforestry trees is presented.
Generally, seeds from pulpy fruits, for example, Kiryowa (Jatropha curcus), Kei apple
(Dovyalis caffra), Musizi (Maesopsis eminii) and Paapali (Caricapapaya) should be dried
under shade until the surface has no moisture. Seeds contained in hard pods such
as those of Nongo (Albizia zygia), Lusina (Leucaena leucocephala), Calliandra calothyrsus,
Kasaana (Acacia species) and Muzimbandeya (Sesbania sesban) should be dried in the
sun.
Seed storage
This is preservation of viable seeds from the time of collection until when they
are required for sowing. The period for which seed can remain viable without
losing germination capacity is greatly affected by quality at the time of collection,
treatment between collection and storage and conditions in which seed is stored.
Mature seeds free of pests and diseases and without physical damage can be
stored for a time under room conditions. But, it is advisable to sow seeds soon
after harvesting so that many of them can produce seedlings. Seeds of most
agroforestry trees should be dried before storing.
Preparing seed for germination
Seed of most tree species, particularly those of leguminous agroforestry shrubs
like Calliandra germinate easily Seeds of some types of trees need treatment.
There are many methods of treating seeds to improve germination. These
include cutting, soaking in water, drilling or cracking the coat of seed before
sowing. Rubbing with sandpaper may also reduce the seed coat. Seeds can be
soaked for one day in warm water at room temperature. Table 2 shows the simple
seeds treatment methods for some agroforestry species.

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Â£one of Uganda
Vegetative "seed" material
Vegetative propagation is the growing of trees from cuttings or other non-seed
material such as roots bulbs and suckers. The cuttings can be obtained from
stems, leaves and branches.
Stem/root cuttings
Tree species such as Mutuba (Ficus natalensis) and Gliricidia sepium are grown from
stem cuttings. Cuttings should not be taken from over-mature trees and in the dry
season. The length of the cuttings can vary from 0.5 to 1.5 meters.
The success of raising plants from cuttings depends on successful development of
roots and the stem cuttings. Three main factors influence the growth of plants
from stem cuttings. These include quality of cutting, treatment of stock material
and environmental conditions during rooting of the cuttings. The season of the
year will also affect the process of rooting of cuttings. Application of growth
promoters such as rooting powder will increase chances of growth.
Cuttings should be raised in well aerated, warm areas free from pests and
diseases. The soil should be of good quality and well-drained.
Grafting and budding
Grafting
Grafting is the method of joining parts of plants together in such a way that they
will combine and continue to grow as one plant. Grafting requires root stocks and
scions. The scion is the part of the plant whose qualities are desired. A root stock
is a plant on which the scion is placed to produce a union between the two and
hence a plant with the desired qualities. Figure 2 shows a root stock and a scion
of a Mango (Muyembe, Mangifera indica) tree. Other fruit trees commonly grafted
to improve yield, quality of products and early fruiting are: Avocado (Persea
americana), Oranges (Citrus species) and Passion.
It is important that the diameter of the scion matches the diameter of the root
stock.

Budding
This is similar to grafting. However, in this case, the scion material is small and is
known as a bud. Budding can be done in various patterns but the "T" and
"inverted T" patterns are the most common. These "T" budding techniques are
illustrated in Figure 3.
Figure 3 Illustration of a budding method

Layering
As was stated earlier on, roots can be used as "seed" material. A common
technique used for producing plants from shoots and roots is called layering. This
is a method by which roots are caused to form on a stem while it is still attached
to the parent plant. The rooted stock is detached and potted as a new plant. Air
layering is the most common method and is illustrated in figure 5.
Figure 4 Air layering
It is used for multipying trees with particularly desirable qualities, for example
oranges.
Tree Growing Activities
Land preparation, planting seedlings, filling gaps, weeding and tree management
are the activities in the growing of trees.
18

Technical Handbook No.21
Land preparation
The preparation of land for planting involves slashing and marking out the field
to be planted according to tree species and their spacing requirements. For
planting trees in existing banana-coffee gardens, only the sites intended for tree
planting are required to be prepared.
Planting seedlings
Seedlings can be grown directly on a seedbed to the time of planting or are
transplanted into containers in which they mature to the time of planting in the field.
Seedlings should be transported to the field for planting after sufficient rain has
fallen and preferably during the peak of a rainy season. Care must be taken not to
damage the seedlings during transportation. Seedlings should be well watered in the
nursery the evening before they are transplanted into the field the following day.
During planting, the pot or polythene tubing is cut and peeled off before putting
the seedling into the pit. The soil around the pot is firmed slightly making sure
the seedling is upright. Figure 5 show the procedures for planting seedlings.
Figure 5a Procedures for planting bare root seedlings
19

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
Seedling should be planted when 15 to 20 cm tall. If the field is not very fertile,
it is advisable to add some farm yard manure to the loosened soil to give the
plants a good start. Seedlings should be planted either early in the morning or in
the evening when it is cool. The seedlings are likely to wilt if they are planted out
in the full heat of the mid-day sun.

Weeding
Like any crop, trees also suffer competition from weeds and damage by other
organisms that take advantage of presence of weeds. To attain good tree growth,
weeding should be done periodically. Where it is uneconomical to weed the whole
area, spot weeding should be done. This involves clearing the area around the
plant. The other method used is slashing along the line of trees.
Apart from weeding, planted trees should be managed so as to obtain the desired
products and services. The different tree management practices are described in
the following section.
Management of trees in agroforestry systems
To obtain desired products and services from an agroforestry practice, the
management of the grown trees and shrubs is important. The common
management activities are discussed in the following sections. The activities
include coppicing, pruning, pollarding and thinning as well as weeding.
20

Technical Handbook No.21
Coppicing
This is a management practice whereby trees are cut at about knee-height from
the ground. Usually, only trees that can re-grow after cutting are coppiced. Such
trees include Lusina (Leucaena leucocephala), Calliandra calothyrsus, Nsambya (Markhamia
lutea), Kalitunsi (Eucalyptus species) and others. Figure 6 illustrates the coppicing
angle and the re-grown tree after coppicing. Coppicing should be done towards
the end of a dry season or just at the beginning of a rainy season so that the
coppiced plants have the opportunity to re-grow well.

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Â£one of Uganda
Pruning
Some trees form extensive branches. In situations where such trees are grown
together with crops, they shade the companion crops and reduce crop yields.
Removing the side branches is then necessary to maintain good crop yields. This
is known as pruning. The branches are cut from the base of the trees to about %
of the height of the trees. Trees are normally pruned to reduce their shading
effects and also to encourage growth of a straight stem. Such trees produce good
timber. Figure 7 illustrates pruning and the results of pruning.
i- "'*8s.
Figure 7 A pruned tree
Pollarding
In some situations, it may only be necessary to remove the top (crown) of the tree
and the top branches to reduce competition between the trees and companion
crops. This is what is known as pollarding. The tops of the trees are cut at about
3m from the base of the tree. Only trees that are known to be able to produce
new shoots after pollarding should be pollarded. Such trees include Avocado (Persea
americana), Grevillea (Grevillea robusta), and Muyembe (Mangifera indica). The leaves
from pollarded trees can be used as mulch or fodder and the branches can be
used as fuelwood. Figure 8 shows a tree before and after pollarding.
22

Technical Handbook No.21
Figure 8 A tree before and after pollarding
Thinning
Thinning is a process whereby some of the trees are cut-down with the objective
of reducing the number of trees in a plot. Thinning is especially recommended
where a commercial woodlot is grown. The starting plant population is
deliberately higher than the expected final plant population, depending on the
desired final product. For example, a woodlot can be established and trees spaced
at 1 m by 1 m apart. After sometime, the spacing can be increased to 2m by 2m.
Firewood and small construction wood are some of the products that can be
obtained from a woodlot during thinning. Figure 9a and b shows a woodlot before
and after thinning.
Figure 9a A woodlot before thinning
23

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
Figure 9b A woodlot after thinning
Root pruning
Roots of trees grown together with food crops should be pruned when the trees
have grown to heights of 2-5 meters. This should be done at the beginning of the
rainy season or at the end of the dry season. The roots are cut at 0.3 to 0.5 meters
from the trunk. Root pruning is done on large trees whose roots can compete with
companion crops for water and nutrients.
Lopping
Lopping is the cutting of portions of branches from the base of a stem. This is
done to obtain fodder or firewood. Only small portions of branches can be cut to
allow trees to continue growing well.
Tree species that can be lopped are those that re-grow easily when cut. For
example, Grevillea (Grevillea robusta) and Calliandra calothyrsus.

Agroforestry Practices
In this chapter, a series of inter-related agroforestry practices are discussed. The
practices are:
â¢ Fodder banks and zero grazing,
â¢ Organic manure and nutrient cycling,
â¢ Home gardens,
â¢ Trees and shrubs for soil and water conservation,
â¢ Multi-purpose trees in banana-coffee gardens
- Multi-purpose trees
- Vanilla production, and
â¢ Commercial woodlots and wood production.
Fodder Banks and Zero Grazing
A. Fodder Banks
Many farmers in the banana-coffee zone have adopted zero grazing as a viable
enterprise. Due to scarcity of land, production of supplementary fodder through
establishment of fodder banks has become necessary. Fodder production for zero
grazing involves use of fast growing grassesâNapier grass, forage legumes
(ebilamba), trees and shrubsâCalliandra calothyrsus; Mulberry/Nkenene (Mortis
alba); Muzimbandeya (Sesbania sesban) and others. Common species used in farms
with zero grazing units in Mbarara are shown in the table below.

Expected benefits
â¢ Different types of fodder in the farm ensure an adequate and balanced
supply of nutrients for the animals.
â¢ Fodder grasses supply energy, whereas the fodder legumes, trees/shrubs
provide protein and minerals.
â¢ When grown along contours on sloping land, grasses, forage legumes and
shrubs reduce soil erosion and provide green manure for fertilising crops
and stabilizing bunds.
â¢ When grown on fallows, forage legumes and shrubs improve soil structure
and fertility.
â¢ The fodder grasses, legumes, trees and shrubs grow vigorously and re-grow
after cutting.
â¢ Fodder banks save time and energy as members of the family are not
required to herd and graze animals.
Description of the Fodder bank production system
Fodder banks can be grown in pure stands of grasses, shrubs and trees or mixed
together as shown in Table 3. Fodder can be established on hedges or blocks
depending on land available. Fodder banks that are well managed can be
harvested at different intervals and thus maintain a continuous supply of feed to
the animals.
Figures 1 Oa, b and c show fodder banks of grass (Setaria splendida) and Calliandra in
farmers' fields.
Establishment of Fodder banks
Fodder banks should be established on a well prepared land. Preparation should
consider soil conservation measures. There are different planting methods which
are specific to different fodder types. Grasses are grown from cuttings and forage
legumes from seed and cuttings. Calliandra, Muzimbandeya (Sesbania sesban),
Ebilamba (Desmodium) can be obtained from seed. Mulberry/Nkenene (Moms alba),
Gliricidia sepium can be grown from cuttings.
Spacing in Calliandra and Napier hedges are normally single or double rows with
Calliandra spaced at 0.5m and Napier and other grasses at 50x100cm or
100x100cm. Strong establishment of legume species requires application of
phosphorous fertilizer such as rock-phosphate. Figure 11 shows the establishment
of a fodder tree hedge by direct sowing.

Management of Fodder banks
Fodder grasses, forage legumes, trees and shrubs for zero-grazing are usually
managed in a cut-and-carry system. For good yields, weed control by hand-picking
is required. Cutting heights are specific to different types of fodder and should be
followed. For example, Napier grass is cut at 1.5m and Calliandra and Lusina
(Leucaena leucocephala) at 0.5m for good re-growth and supply of fodder material.
The first cutting should be done at least six months from the time of planting.
Manuring of the fodder banks is important for returning nutrients to the soil.
Calliandra
Harvest: 9-12 months after planting, Calliandra will have reached a height of
about 2 metres (6 feet) and can be cut back. Figure 12 shows a coppiced Calliandra
hedge.
29

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
Figure 12 Coppiced Calliandra hedge
A well-established stand can be harvested up to 5-6 times a year, with shorter
intervals during the rainy season. The cutting height should be 1 metre above
ground, but usually lower in order to minimise the shading effect on crops.
Productivity: Three kilograms of fresh Calliandra fodder (about 1 kg dry matter)
can replace 1 kg of dairy meal. In general Calliandra is fed in addition to dairy
meal with Calliandra constituting ty to *fe of the total diet.
Productivity of Calliandra is, in general, 3 kgs dry matter per metre of single hedge
per year. If a farmer wants to feed 1 cow with 6 kg fresh Calliandra (2 kg dry
matter) every day in a year, the farmer would need a hedge which is
approximately 250m long. If the spacing between the trees is 50 cm, the total
number of trees required would be 500. Many small-scale dairy farmers have
benefited from growing Calliandra fodder. The experience of Mrs. Joy Mawanda
(Nyabushabe Kabale Two wings agroforestry group), illustrates the benefits of
growing Calliandra fodder (Box 1).
30

Technical Handbook Mo.21
Box 1 Fodder banks: the experience of Mrs. Joy Mawanda
Increases in human population over the years have reduced area of land available for
households in rural Uganda. In highly populated areas like Kabale district, grazing
land has become limited. This has made it necessary for household to adopt
alternative ways of rearing livestock for production of milk. Zero grazing is a
livestock rearing technology' that has been adopted by some farmers.
Establishing fodder banks using shrubs with good fodder quality like Calliandra has
benefited farmers. Mrs. Joy Mawanda, the chairperson of Nyabushabe Two Wings
agroforestry group in Kabale has had a benefiting experience with Calliandra fodder
banks.
Mrs. Mawanda lives in Nyabushabe \dllage, Ndorwa County in Kabale district. She
is a subsistence farmer. Her family of seven people depend on the 4 acres (1.8 ha) of
land for their livelihood. Mrs Mawanda learnt about the fodder bank technology
from the Nyabushabe Two Wings agroforestry group. According to the group
members, sharing of knowledge and acquiring of skills are some of the main benefits
of association with the Nyabushabe women group. Through the group, they have had
contacts with research organisations like the International Centre for Research in
Agroforestry (ICRAF). They have been able to travel to Kenya and share experiences
with Kenyan farmers who are also collaborating with ICRAF. Indeed, whereas the
women appreciated the importance of training materials such as manuals, they said
that "seeing is better", therefore study tours and demonstrations should complement
written materials.
Mrs. Mawanda planted hedges of Calliandra along soil conservation bunds. On a half-
acre (0.1 ha) piece of the land, she has grown a pure stand of elephant grass.
Although she has only one Friesian cow, this farmer noted that management of the
technology is not easy. She cuts the hedges at 1.5m above the ground 3 to 4 months
after re-growth. The obtained fodder is not enough for the animal. According to the
experience of Mrs. Mawanda, the cow eats the following quantities of food per day:
Type of feed
Quantity per day
1. Elephant grass
1 sack (20Kg)
2. Calliandra leaves
5Kg
3. Sweet potato vines
2 sacks (40Kg)
4. Commercial feeds
Variable quantities
The comparative advantage of this technology relative to alternative land use options
may be difficult to quantify. However, Mrs Mawanda explained that income from the
dairy enterprise supplements the cash and non-cash benefits of the technologies. She
31

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
estimated income and other benefits from the technology as follows:
Type of output

2. Irish potatoes

10,000.00
20,000.00/season
Estimated monthly income 105,700 Ush.
Irish potatoes take about three months to mature. Hence the monthly benefit from
Irish potato yields resulting from application of manure from the dairy enterprise is
about 6,700 USh per month. In addition, she said that generally ,the fertility of soil
in her farm has improved. Yields of other crops like bananas and cabbages also
improved. She associates the soil fertility improvement 'with application of manure.
Some of the limitations of the technology, said Mrs. Mawanda, include:
â¢
High demand for labour. The labour is expensive to hire. In her case, she hired
labour at 10,000 USh per month.
â¢ Lack of inputs such as seedlings for fodder trees and improved grass.
â¢
Expensive commercial dairy feed.
â¢
Expensive drugs.
The estimated cash and non-cash benefits of the fodder bank technology as narrated
by Mrs. Mawanda suggest that despite the limitations of the technology, the growing
of fodder shrubs saves livestock feeding costs and is a good source of income and
improved nutrition for households.
Napier grass
Napier grass is harvested when it is 90-120 cm (3 to 4 feet high). Enough grass is
cut to feed the animals for one day starting progressively at the end of the row. If
the livestock do not eat all the grass, the remainder is used as mulch or for
composting.
â¢
Limitations of Fodder bank production
â¢
It is costly to establish a good stand of trees and shrubs for fodder.
â¢
It is difficult and expensive to change a fodder bank to other crop
production systems.
â¢
Some fodder trees like Lusina (Leucaena leucocephala) are susceptible to pests
like Leucaena pssylid; however, other species of Leucaena such as L. diversifolia
are resistant to the pssylid.
â¢ Napier grass can become a weed if not managed properly.

Technical Handbook No. 21
B. Zero-Grazing
Fodder banks support the zero-grazing system where animals are managed under
confinement. The animals, like cattle and goats are usually stall-fed.
Introduction
Zero grazing is a livestock management practice, where animals are confined and
stall fed as opposed to free grazing. This practice is gaining popularity particularly
where land-holding sizes are diminishing and grazing is not an option. Cattle and
goats are the most zero grazed livestock species and economic efficiency of this is
achieved when high yielding breeds are used. Advantages of associated with the
practice are: -
â¢ Exposure to parasites and diseases vectors is reduced.
â¢ Manure is easily collected and distributed in the farm enhancing soil
fertility.
â¢ Less energy wasted by animals in walking as compared to free grazing
â¢ Better control on breeding and animal health.
Expected Benefits
â¢ Enables keeping of animals in areas with land shortage.
â¢ Increases land productivity by increasing crop yields through the easier
collection of manure.
â¢ Milk, meat and the live animals provide cash income.
â¢ Improved household nutrition from milk, meat and vegetables from the
home gardens, and
â¢ Reduced transmission of disease because the animals are closely
monitored.
Establishment and Management
It is important to select a good breed of animal for improved productivity. A good
shed is designed for ease of management to:
â¢ Facilitate feeding;
â¢ Collection of manure; and
â¢ Comfort of the animal.
The feeding strategy for zero-grazed animals will depend on available feed
resources. A good feed resource base should include natural pastures, fodder
banks, crop residues and purchased feeds. High yielding breeds normally kept
under zero-grazing are susceptible to many diseases so good animal health
programmes should be followed. Availability of adequate water is necessary for
successful zero-grazing.
33

Limitations
â¢ High yielding breeds are very susceptible to disease.
â¢ Good animal health programmes are not available in many rural areas.
â¢ Access to drugs and vaccines in rural areas is poor.

Organic Manures and Nutrient Cycling
Organic manure includes different types of manure obtained from plant and
animal waste. Organic manure includes animal manure, compost, liquid and
green manure. Animal manure includes dung, urine and other animal waste.
Compost is obtained from plant residues and other wastes from home
compounds. Liquid manure is prepared from animal dung or from fresh leaves of
high-protein leguminous trees. Green manure, like compost, is obtained from
plant residues and other wastes from home compounds. In this chapter, the
production and benefits of producing organic manure is discussed.
Animal manure
Good handling of animal manure is necessary to avoid loss of volatile nutrients
rich in nitrogen. It must therefore be covered with available material like banana
leaves or polythene sheets. It should not be applied directly to the field, but should
be left to decompose. When applying, the manure, it should be covered in the soil
to avoid loss of nutrients and allow for further decomposition. The quality of the
manure depends on the quality of the feeds.
Compost manure
During production of compost manure, large amounts of vegetation such as crop
remains, garden weeds, kitchen and household waste, hedge cuttings, and
garbage are put to good use.
Expected Benefits
â¢ When properly made, compost is immediately available as plant food;
â¢ Compost does not cause excessive weed growth;
â¢ Good crop yields can be obtained without the need for extra chemical
inputs;
â¢ All farmers regardless of their financial abilities, can make and use
compost;
â¢ Compost manure can be used in all soils with low fertility;
â¢ Compost manure is especially good in areas that receive low rainfall. In
such areas, artificial fertilisers cannot be used effectively because of limited
moisture;
â¢ Compost manure is also useful in sandy soils which have poor water holding
capacity.
Making compost manure
Making compost manure (composting) is the process of converting vegetation
35

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
materials such as crop residues, kitchen waste, household waste, hedge cuttings
and garbage into valuable plant food called humus which is an organic fertiliser.
This type of fertiliser has got balanced plant nutrients.
Description and design
Humus is an important type of manure. In the banana-coffee zone, compost pits
are constructed within the home gardens or in the banana farms.
Humus is important because:
â¢ It makes the soil crumbly and therefore easy to cultivate.
â¢ A good soil with crumbly structure is well aired. Air in the soil is needed for
growth by crops.
â¢ Good aerated soil is essential for good root growth and decomposition of
the humus.
â¢ Humus increases the water holding capacity of the soil because it makes it
spongy.
Materials needed for composting include:
â¢ Dry vegetation material (100 parts).
â¢ Green vegetation material (50 parts).
â¢ It is recommended that the green vegetation include leaves of high-protein
leguminous trees such as Calliandra.
â¢ Animals' or birds' waste if available (6 parts). Cow dung and goat droppings
are suitable.
â¢ Ordinary top soil from the garden (7 parts).
â¢ Ordinary wood ash.
â¢ Water and materials for covering.
â¢ Tools: ordinary hand hoe, panga or machete and a stick.
Establishment
Establishing a compost is not difficult. The process described in this section may
seem long. However, the process can easily be adapted to suit specific conditions.
Mrs Nalwoga Mariam Kasujja, of Nkozi sub-county, in Mpigi district, has
successfully practised composting and improved yields of her bananas (Box 2).
Preparing compost
â¢ Select a sheltered place with shade not far from the garden or where the
compost will be used. Usually under a tree is better. In drier areas, the pit
method is preferred because it conserves moisture. The pit method should
not be used in wet areas as the composite may become waterlogged.
â¢ In the pit method, the pit is usually 1.2 metres (4 feet) wide and 0.6 metres
36

Technical Handbook No.21
deep (2 feet) and as long as necessary depending on the amount of material
available. The pile is then built up in the pit. In the absence of natural
shade make a simple artificial shade using locally available materials like
grass or banana leaves. The place should be sheltered from wind, rain, sun
and runoff.
â¢ Measure out an area 1.5 metres wide and a convenient length depending
on the quantity of available materials you can get. You must be able to work
on the compost pile without walking on it.
â¢ Loosen out the soil/ground where the compost pile will be constructed to
30 cm deep and water it. Put this soil on one side of the trench because you
will need it later. The materials will need close contact with the loose soil at
the bottom for good results.
The Process of making the compost*
The following steps are taken to make the compost.
1. The first layer or course should be of rough dry vegetation materials such
as maize stalks, dry grass and leaves or sunflower heads. Chop or cut these
materials into small pieces, pile them to make a layer of about 30 cm
thick.
2. The second layer should be of dry vegetation, hedge cuttings or grass.
3. Sprinkle water on this layer. The layer should be 10-15 cm thick
4. The third layer should be of animals' or birds' waste or old compost and
should be about 10 cm thick. This layer is important as it contains
organisms which are necessary for decomposition.
5. Sprinkle some top soil to a thickness of about 5 cm to cover the material.
6. This is followed by a layer of green leaves from high protein leguminous
trees like Calliandra, Lusina (Leucaena leucocephala), Muzimbandeya (Sesbania
sesban) and Albizia. This layer should be 15-20 cm. Where these materials
are not available, any green grass or green leaves may be used.
7. Sprinkle wood ashes and top soil on the pile. The ashes contain valuable
minerals and neutralise acids produced during decomposition.
8. Water the whole pile well using any container or preferably a watering can.
9. The process of layer preparation can be repeated starting with rough
vegetation material, then grass, animal droppings, top soil, green leaves,
ash and top soil and water.
10. Build the pile up to 1.5 m high. A well-made pile has almost vertical sides
and a flat top.

11. Take a long, sharp pointed stick and drive it into the pile of compost in a
slanting manner.
12. Lastly water the pile slightly. The pile should never be too dry or too wet.
Cover it all with a layer of top soil about 10 cm thick. Cover with dry
vegetation to reduce water loss through evaporation.
Figure 14 A typical compost pile
Box 2 Making and using compost manure: case of Mrs. Kasujja
Mrs. Kasujja lives in Nkozi, Mpigi district. She lives on a 4 acre (1.5ha) price of land.
The four acres are planted with different crops. Bananas mixed with other annual
crops like beans are grown on 1 acre. On another acre, she grows annual crops only.
Coffee as a sole crop is grown on 1 acre. The homestead and a small home-garden
cover another 1 acre of her land. The land which Mrs. Kasujja cultivates is family
land. Her polygamous husband lives elsewhere with another wife. Mrs. Kasujja has
therefore been the head of her household and makes all decisions on the use of farm
resources.
She learnt about composting after attending a course on soil fertility and banana
management by the Ministry of Agriculture in 1996. Her main reason for starting to
make compost was to improve productivity of her farm which had started to decline.
Description of practice
The following is a description on how compost manure is made as narrated by Mrs.
Kasujja. Her experience compared to the description presented in the previous
section demonstrates the adaptation of the composting technology by farmers.
38

Technical Handbook No.21
She digs pits approximately 6 ft (2m) wide and 6 ft (2m) deep in one area in the
banana plantation. She then pours into the pits materials such as farm waste, kitchen
wastes, weeds, poultry droppings, goat droppings, wood ash, and any green
vegetation. A stick which is about 1 meter long is dipped into the material. The stick
is used for testing the performance of the composting process.
The pit is covered with banana leaves and split banana stems. She then covers it with
soil. Later on, the pit is opened and coarse material such as twigs and stones which
cannot decompose are removed.
During a rainy season, the compost materials take 12 months to get ready for use as
manure. To ensure continuous availability of compost manure, Mrs. Kasujja dug
three pits. Each of the pits is filled at different times. ;
Application rates
According to her, a pit 6ftx6ft (2mx2m) can cover 40 banana stools (about 1 acre of
land of a banana plantation).
On mature bananas, she places the manure 2ft away from the base of the banana
stem. According to her experience, banana roots are found 2ft away from the stem.
So they feed on the introduced manure. She applies about 1 basin full of manure per
banana stool. When planting bananas, she first mixes the compost manure with
topsoil before putting back into the holes for the bananas.
In the case of green vegetables, Mrs. Kasujja first mixes the compost manure with soil
before sowing. She also applies the compost manure in holes before planting clonal
coffee.
Cost of the technology
Estimating the cost of the technology can be difficult because most of the necessary
resources are found within the farm. Labour for constructing compost pits is the most
expensive input.
Mrs. Kasujja said the 6ft x 6ft pit took her sons aged 16 years and 14 years
respectively, a total of 4 hours to dig. This is equivalent to one person working for a
day which would have cost her Uganda shillings 1,000/=.
Benefits
According to her, practising composting has provided many benefits:
â¢
The compost manure has maintained the bananas for a long time She
established the farm in 1960 and its productivity was declining. The compost
manure rejuvenated the farm.
â¢
She observes that even in dry season her plantation looks healthier compared
to those of her neighbours who do not use: compost.

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
â¢ Pests such as nematodes have reduced.
â¢ She harvests big bunches.
Limitations
â¢ Compost manure attracts a lot of weevils. But she has learnt a cultural method
of controlling them. She splits the banana stems after harvesting and this
exposes the weevils. They are hand picked and killed.
â¢ Composting is labour intensive.
â¢ Composting requires a lot of materials. Some have to be got outside the farm
and she lacks transport.
Managing the compost
â¢ After 3-4 days, pull the stick out from your pile to see if decomposition is
taking place in the pile. If the stick is warm and smells sligfrdy, the pile is
decomposing.
â¢ The stick also helps you to check on the condition of the pile from time to
time. It will show when the pile is dry or moist. When it becomes cool, that
shows that the decomposition has not taken place. The pile is turned for the
first time. Sometimes the stick is white. This is caused by a fungus called fire
fang which stops decomposition. To overcome this, add water and turn the
pile.
â¢ The pile must be watered occasionally, say every three days depending on
weather conditions. If it is raining there is no need to water.
â¢ After 2-3 weeks, turn the pile over. Do not add any fresh materials, during
turning except water. Turning the pile is important because it mixes the
different layers, making the decomposition faster and more complete.
â¢ Make sure that while turning, the bottom part of the pile becomes the top
of the new pile.
â¢ The compost should be ready after 4 weeks. Check the condition of the pile.
If the stick feels warm when pulled out of the pile, it means that the material
is still decomposing and the compost is not ready. Ready compost should
have a fresh, earthy smell and contain no grass, leaves or animal manure.
â¢ Store the compost by covering it with a layer of banana leaves or polythene.
Using Compost
â¢ Compost should be placed as close to plants' roots as possible.
â¢ The bigger the amount applied the better the soil and crops.
â¢ For perennial crops, compost should be applied at planting time and during
the rains for better results.
40

Technical Handbook Mo.21
Figure 15 How to test decomposition in a compost pit
â¢ In case of tree crops make a trench of 3-4 inches (7-10 cm ) deep at the
end of the canopy and apply the compost. Cover with top soil.
â¢ The earlier the compost is applied to the crop the better the results.
â¢ In general, well decomposed compost should be applied at the rate of 20
tons/ha (8 tons/acre). This is about 2 large hoe-fulls per square metre or
enough to barely cover the ground with a layer 1 cm thick.
Limitations to Compost Making and Use
â¢ Compost requires a lot of labour to collect the materials, prepare it and
spread it over the farm.
â¢ The nutrient composition of the compost varies a great deal. It depends on
the materials used and the preparation methods.
â¢ Not enough vegetation to make compost may be available in drier areas.

Liquid manure*
Liquid manure is an organic fertiliser that is applied in a liquid form. It is applied
to plants in their early growing stages after germination. It is prepared from either
animal dung or from fresh leaves of high-protein leguminous trees.
Benefits of Liquid Manure
â¢ Cheap source of nitrogen for plants. Increases yield of crops when used,
especially on cabbages, tomatoes and eggplants.
â¢ Easy to make.
â¢ Cheap to make.
â¢ Provides a chance to water the crops, especially in dry weather conditions.
â¢ Promotes utilisation of livestock wastes.
Description and design
Liquid manure can be produced easily within a farm (Figure 16).
Materials and equipment needed:
â¢ Chicken, rabbit, goat, pig or cow dung free of saw dust and stones.
â¢ A drum or any similar size of container.
â¢ A strong pole and rope.
â¢ A strong sack/gunny bag.
The following steps are undertaken to produce liquid manure:
â¢ Fill the gunny bag with animal dung about 50kg for 3/4 full of water in the
drum. Tie off the mouth of the bag with a secure strong rope.
â¢ Suspend the bag of dung in the drum of water. Cover the drum to prevent
evaporation.
â¢ Leave it to stand for 2 weeks.
â¢ After 3 days and every other day thereafter, stir the drum by lifting the bag
several times using the cross poles.
â¢ At the end of two weeks, the water will have turned dark. Most of the plant
food contained in the dung will have been washed into the water. Remove
the bag and squeeze as much as possible into the drum.
â¢ Dilute the contents of the drum in the ratio of 1:2. To one part of the liquid
manure, add two parts of clean water. Then apply to growing plants. Figure
16 shows a drum used for producing liquid manure.

Figure 16 Producing liquid manure
How to apply
â¢ Using a watering can, once a week, pour the liquid manure around the stem
and not on the leaves of the crops. Water around the roots near the stem.
â¢ Water with the liquid manure for 2 or 3 weeks. It is effective as top dressing
fertiliser after planting the crop with the compost manure.
A similar type of liquid manure can be prepared from the leaves of leguminous
trees high in nitrogen content. Such trees include Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala),
Miizimbandeya (Sesbania sesban), Gasiya (Senna species), Nongo (Albizia zygia) and
Ebilamba (forage crops).
Limitations
â¢ It is difficult to prepare and apply to large plots of land.
â¢ Liquid manure splashed on plant leaves can cause damage.
â¢ Poor farmers may not be able to afford the containers.
â¢ Livestock waste may be scarce

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
Green Manure *
Introduction
Green manure is produced by planting fast-growing leguminous plants on a piece
of land to improve soil fertility and protect the soil from erosion. They are
normally low, spreading plants that grow fast and cover the soil surface quickly
after planting. During or after the growing season, the green-manure plants are
slashed and incorporated into the soil, where they decompose, releasing nutrients
and improving the soil structure.
Expected benefits
â¢ Some types of green manure plants provide food or fodder in addition to
conserving and improving the soil.
â¢ Lupin (a fodder legume) is good at recycling phosphorus as well as nitrogen.
â¢ Green manure suppresses weeds by shading them out.
â¢ Relatively little labour is needed, compared to other ways of adding organic
matter tc the soil.
â¢ Green manure is cheap to plant and easy to manage.
Green manure conserves and improves the soil in several ways:
â¢ Legumes such as soybeans, green grams, groundnuts and pigeon peas take
nitrogen from the air and fix it in a form they can use. When the legume
dies and rots, the nitrogen in the leaves, stem and roots is released into the
soil, where other plants can use it. The rotting plants also increase the
amount of organic matter in the soil.
â¢ Green-manure crops prevent the soil from being washed away by rainwater.
If raindrop hits bare soil, the splash dislodges tiny soil particles, which can
be washed away easily. The impact of raindrop also compacts the surface,
making it harder for the rainwater to seep into the soil. Instead of seeping
in, the water runs off the surface, carrying with it the dislodged particles.
On gentle slopes, this can cause gullies. The green manure acts as a cover
crop. It breaks the fall of raindrops. This prevents compaction and helps
the water seep into the soil instead of running off. Roots bind the soil and
stop running water from eroding it.
â¢ The green-manure crop protects the soil from the direct heat of the sun,
helping it to retain moisture. It breaks the wind and stops soil particles from
being blown away.
â¢ The green-manure crop can be grown as a pure stand, to enrich the soil for
a cereal crop grown in a subsequent season. It can also be grown as an
inter-crop between rows of another main crop, such as maize, sorghum and
44

Technical Handbook No.21
millet, or beneath fruit trees. Growing of green manure crops is especially
appropriate in the following situations:
â¢ If soils are infertile and in areas with low rainfall, where artificial
fertiliser cannot be used effectively because of limited moisture.
â¢ On sandy soils, as deep-rooted legumes help recycle nutrients.
â¢ On heavy clay soils.
â¢ On hilly slopes and places prone to strong winds.
Establishment
To grow a green manure crop, one requires green-manure crop seeds, inoculant
(for some types of legumes), a hoe and sand. The sand is mixed with the seeds of
the green manure crop before planting to reduce crowding of germinated
seedlings.
Planting as a pure stand
The following steps are followed to establish a pure stand of a green manure crop.
1) Prepare a seedbed by digging the soil and removing the weeds.
2) Water the seedbed, and plant the seeds or cuttings of the green-manure
crop. Space the plants closely so they cover the ground quickly when they
start growing.
3) If necessary, weed the plot regularly to reduce weeds and pests.
4) While the green manure crop grows and flowers, it fixes nitrogen in the
nodules on its roots. After flowering, the legume leaves fall off, increasing
the amount of organic matter in the soil. Sun hemp is a good type of green
manure crop. Turn the sun hemp into the soil just after the plants have
flowered.
5) Gut the leaves and stems for fodder if necessary, but do not remove the
entire plant or expose the soil surface.
6) Harvest the pods of the green-manure crop to obtain seeds
7) Slash the remaining stalks and leaves and, if possible on the same day, turn
them into the soil. Fodder legumes, such as velvet bean and lablab bean,
can be left to grow for up to 2 years before slashing them.
8) Wait for at least 7 days before planting the next crop to allow the stalks and
leaves to decompose.
9) Plant the next crop as a pure stand of cereal, or inter-crop again with
legumes.
45

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
Planting green manure as an inter-crop
A green-manure legume can also be planted as an inter-crop between the rows of
the main crop. Choose the type of green manure and planting times carefully so
it will not grow taller than the main crop and shade it out.
â¢ Choose the type of green manure crop that grows well in your area. For most
legume species, plant at the same time as the cereal crop, so the crops can
germinate before the heavy rains. Broadcast small-seeded legumes, such as
Sun hemp, stylosanthes, red gram and seratro. Plant larger seeds in rows between
the rows of cereal. Plant velvetbean and lablab bean about 2 weeks after the
cereal, as they grow fast and would shade out the cereal if planted earlier.
â¢ Continue with steps 3-9 as outlined for planting pure stands of green
manure crop.
Limitations
â¢ The benefits of green manure may be long-term if the practice is not
continued
â¢ It can be difficult to incorporate green manure into an existing cropping
system.
â¢ Some green-manure crops may compete with the main crop for light and
nutrients. It is important to select green manure crops carefully so that they
do not interfere with the main crop.
â¢ Some green manure crops may attract new pests and diseases which may
attack the crops.
â¢ Some may become weeds by seeding and growing in the crop field during
the next season.
â¢ Green manure crops may not grow well in the dry season, especially in drier
areas.
â¢ If a green-manure legume has not been grown in the field before, the soil
may not contain the bacteria it needs to fix nitrogen.

Technical Handbook No. 21
Home gardens
Introduction
A home garden is an agroforestry practice that is common throughout Uganda.
Different types of products and services are obtained from the various tree species
and crops grown in a home garden. For example, yields of about 150 kg/ha of
beans, 400 kg/ha of un-husked coffee, and 400 kg/ha of bananas; variable
quantities of fruits, vegetables, and herbs can be produced.
Some farmers say that home gardens are a good way of using land for a long time
without using a lot of labour. The experience of Mr. Charles Ntege of Kiwanga
Village in Mukono District illustrates benefit of homegardens presented in Box 3.
Expected benefits
Services
â¢ Improve soil fertility.
â¢ Control of soil erosion.
â¢ Conservation of soil moisture and so improved cropped yields.
â¢ Reduced total crop failure because many types of crops are grown.
â¢ Due to closeness to homesteads, home-gardens are easy and convenient to
manage.
â¢ Time and energy saving because the garden is near the home.
â¢ Improved crop yields.
â¢ Improved nutrition for the family.
â¢ Re-use of water from households.
Products
â¢ Food supplies and regular cash incomes from many products (fruits,
vegetables and herbs, fuelwood, fodder, timber and poles).
Description and design
Home gardens consist of a diverse mixture of vegetables, fruits, and medicinal
plants and also fodder grasses and shrubs in small intensively cultivated plots in
and around home compounds. In heavily populated areas like Mpigi, Mukono
and Masaka, land owned by households average 0.2 ha. The households inter-
crop many different types of food crops and herbs. The density of vegetation in
the farm of Ntege (Box 3) illustrates the density of crops in home gardens. The
common species in home gardens in the banana-coffee farming system are listed
in Table 4.
47

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee zone of Uganda
Box 3 Home gardens: Mr. Ntege's case
Mr. Ntege lives in Kiwanga village, Goma sub-county in Mukono District. The land
on which he and his family live is a Kibanja in mailo land. The area of land to which
he has user right is three acres. Of this, he established a home garden on one acre.
He established the home garden because the land he "owns" is small and he was also
interested in growing perennial fruit trees.
To establish the home garden, Mr. Ntege first planted the fruit trees such as jackfruit
Fene (Artocarpus heterophyllus), Avocado (Persea americana), Paapali (Carica papaya), and
Muyembe (Mangifera indica). Later he introduced crops like coffee and bananas as well
as napier grass. Trees that grow to large sizes like Nsambya [Markhamia lutea), Musizi
(Maesopsis eminii) and Mlituba (Ficus natalensis) were introduced much later. He found
some of the Nsambya {Markhamia lutea) trees growing naturally on the land. Nsambya
[Markhamia lutea) regenerates easily through self-seed dispersal.
Although Ntege's land is small, he has 22 Robusta coffee, 10 Paapali, 20 Avocado, 25
Fene, 6 Mutuba, 3 Musizij many Nsambya trees and 30 banana stems. Even though his
farm is congested with different types of crops, he uses very little labour in the
management of the farm. Apart from periodic introduction of new food crops, he
does not prepare for a new season crop because few weeds grow underneath the
heavy canopy of trees. Weeding is also minimal. But, he keeps a keen eye on bananas
and applies wood ash on bananas just before the rains to control the banana weevil.
Soil resilience is possible because of decomposition of the heavy leaf litter.
At 60 years, Ntege looks back and counts many economic benefits that he has
obtained from the small farm. He has been able to bring up his seven children; four
of whom are now independent adults. He depends heavily on the sale of poles of
Nsambya [Markhamia lutea). Each pole sells at USh 800. In addition, firewood
harvested from Mutuba (Ficus natalensis) and other trees covers the domestic needs for
fuel and also fuel for firing bricks; a major source of income for Ntege. He has a
major plan to build a new house. He will produce about 10,000 bricks for building
the house. To fire the bricks, most of the firewood will be harvested from his farm. A
fired brick costs USh 80. So Ntege will have saved USh 0.8 million which he would
have used to buy the 10,000 bricks for building his house.
The main benefit of home gardens, said Ntege, is that many different products and
services can be obtained from the farm for a long time.

The different types of trees and crops listed in Table 4 are planted in specific
areas of the home garden. Figure 11 shows a typical arrangement of crops in a
home garden.
Figure 17 A typical arrangement of crops in a home garden
Establishment
The establishment of home gardens requires a lot of time and labour. This is
because trees in home gardens may be planted or may be managed after they
have grown naturally. But after establishment, homegardens require less time for
maintenance. There are three main methods for establishing home gardens.
These are:
â¢ Adding new tree species to an existing garden,
â¢ Adding vegetables, fruits and root crops, beneath open canopy of existing
trees, and
â¢ Planting desired tree species and crop combinations on clean prepared
plots.
Management
Home gardens are a complex land use practice whose management varies from
farm to farm. With regard to vegetables produced from home gardens such as
spinach, nakati and dodo, harvesting can be done every two weeks and sold in
50

Technical Handbook No.21
bundles of USh 100, 200 and 400/-. An average sized double-dug home garden
bed produces 20 bundles every 2 weeks. This is a source of regular income. With
regard to trees in home gardes, the narration by Mr. Ntege in Box 2 shows this.
Limitations
Although home gardens are an agroforestry practice known to farmers,
information that can provide general guidelines on management is limited.

Trees and Shrubs for Soil and Water Management
Introduction
The management of soils on a farm includes soil and water conservation and soil
fertility management. This section focuses on trees and shrubs for soil
conservation throughout the farm and includes a small section on improved
fallows for annual cropping land.
Earth works are mainly constructed in areas where land is not flat. In such areas,
soil can be washed away by rainwater. After many years, if earth works have not
been constructed to prevent soil from being washed away, the soil becomes less
fertile and crop yields decline. Earthworks are therefore constructed on slopy
ground to prevent run-off of water and soil erosion. Trees, shrubs or grass
planted on the earthwork structures stabilise them.
There are many types of earthworks. Some need a lot of labour to construct,
others are constructed easily. Even after construction, earthworks should be
managed to ensure that they do not break down. In this chapter, two common
types of earthworks and their maintenance are discussed. These are "Fanya Juu"
and "Fanya Chini".
Expected benefits
â¢ Prevent soil from being washed away by rain water.
â¢ Trees and shrubs occupy space along ditches and on top of ridges. These are
areas where crops are not grown. So, total output from the farm is increased.
â¢ Trees and shrubs on earthwork structures can provide crops with light
shade, shelter from wind and nutrients from increased leaf litter.
â¢ Increased crop yields because of improved soil moisture availability.
â¢ Different types of products like fodder, timber, medicines and fuelwood can
be obtained from trees on earthworks.
â¢ Roots and leaves from the trees stabilise the earth structures and improve
soil and water conservation.
â¢ The benefits of earth structures for management of land are many as the
discussion with one farmer in Mbarara reveals (see Box 5).
Description and design
Small earthwork structures can be used to slow down runoff water, prevent soil
erosion and hence improve water conservation in croplands. When runoff water
is slowed down, the water infiltrates the soil and is available to crops. In addition
to conservation of both soil and water, earthwork structures provide good
planting sites for trees, shrubs and grasses. Figure 18 shows trees on earthwork
structures.
52

Technical Handbook No. 21
Figure 18 Trees on earthworks
Description of "Fanya Juu" and "Fanya Chini"
It is recommended that "Fanya Chini" should be constructed on the upper part
of the farm so as to trap run-off water. "Fanya Chini" may also be constructed
in the middle of the farm if the slope of the land is very gentle. "Fanya Juu"
should be constructed in the middle and lower sections of a farm especially in
areas with very steep land. "Fanya Chini should not be constructed in such areas.

harvested from the trees and shrubs. Other tree species that can be used for
stabilising the earthworks include: Grevillea, Nsambya (Markhamia lutea), Mutuba
(Ficus natalensis) and fruit trees. Grasses, mainly Napier, Setaria splendida and
Tripsacum laxum, are planted on the ridges of small earthwork structures to
stabilise them. The grasses can be harvested periodically for fodder. The grasses
can be grown together with the trees and shrubs on the ridges.
Establishment
The "Fanya Juu" trenches are made by digging soil from the trench and throwing
it uphill to form a ridge while for "Fanya Chini" the soil from the trench is thrown
downhill. Figure 19 illustrates a "Fanya Juu" and a "Fanya Chini" respectively.

Technical Handbook Mo.21
Before constructing the earthworks, careful planning is necessary. This involves
determining the slope of the land, the type of earthwork to be constructed, the
location of contour lines and the distance between them and their width.
There are two types of tools used for locating the contours and determining the
distance between contours. They are the spirit or line level and the A-Frame (Box
4). Only one of these tools is needed. The use of any of these tools requires some
skills. In addition, the tools may not be easily available locally. It is therefore
advisable to contact the local Agricultural Office for assistance on the laying-out
of contours.
Box 4 Contour farming using the spirit or iine level and A-Frame *
Contour Farming
Soil erosion can be a major problem which, if not controlled, results in loss of the
top soil and decline in land productivity. Over time, a number of practices and
technologies to control soil erosion have been developed. These involve the creation
of barriers along contours which slow the speed of water run-off down the slope
and therefore encourage sinking of water into the soil. These practices and
technologies require a farmer to first locate contour lines using either a line level or
an "A-frame".
Below is a description on how to construct, mark and use an A-frame to establish
contours.
Materials
â¢
two strong sticks each, 6 ft (2 m) Ion;
â¢
one stick, 4 ft (1.5 m) long
â¢
three 2-inch (5 cm) nails
â¢
about 4 ft (1.5 m) of strong string
â¢
a fist-sized stone
â¢
two pegs about 2 ft (60 cm) long.
Method
Step 1
Cross the two 6-ft long sticks
at the top and nail them
together securely.
55

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
Now the A-frame is almost complete, but before it can be used to mark contours, a
point must be found on the crossbar which will indicate when the two legs are in a
level position.
56

Technical Handbook J\fo.21
Step 8
If the ground is level, the string
will settle in the same position
as in Step 6. Now move to
Point 1
Step 10. If the string does not
settle in the same position as in
Step 6, mark the new point
(Point 2) where the string settles
without touching the crossbar.
Step 9
Put a third mark (Point 3)
halfway between Points 1
and 2. This is the point on
the crossbar which will indicate when the two legs are in a level position.
Step 10
Using a panga or knife, make a permanent mark by cuttins a notch At the
level position.
Step 11
When the weighted string hangs directly in front of the cut notch, the two
legs are in a level position.
Now the construction of the A-frame is complete and it is ready to be used to mark
contours on sloping land!
Using an A-Frame to Establish Contours
To determine the location of contours using an A-frame, do the following:
Step 1
Study the area of your field on which you want to construct contour
barriers. Start at the highest point (upper boundary) of your field. The A-
frame should only be used when the ground is firm, like in the dry season
when the legs of the A-frame do not enter the soil.
Step 2
First, cut a supply of pegs. These are used for marking level lines where
contour barriers will be constructed.
Step 3
Drive the first peg (peg 1) at the uppermost edge of the field. You will begin
marking the contour lines at this point.
57

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone Â°f Uganda
Step 7
Lift the A-frame again putting leg 1 at peg 2. Adjust leg 2 until the string
settles at the position of the notch without touching the cross bar as in Step
4 above. Drive another peg (peg 3) just above but touching leg 2 of the A-
frame.
Step 8
Continue with the exercise across the slope up to the end of the field. Now
you have a lineâa contourâof pegs across the field.
Step 9
Adjust the pegs which are not in line with the others to make a smooth
curve.

Technical Handbook No.21
After the positions of contours are marked, the construction of the earth
structures follows. The following steps are taken to establish earth structures and
the stabilising trees and grass. These can be grass only or grass and trees/shrubs.
â¢ Dig a canal and either, throw the soil above the canal to construct "Fanya
Juu" or on the lower side of the canal to construct "Fanya Chini". The
width of the canal will depend on the slope of the land. Generally, it is
recommended that the canal should be 1.5-2 feet (45cm-60cm) wide and
1.5-2 feet deep;
â¢ On the bands, dig holes 6 inches (15cm) deep and 1-2 feet (3cm-60cm)
apart for planting grass/shrubs. Along the same bund, holes 3 feet (lm)
deep are dug 10 feet (3m) apart for planting seedlings that grow to big trees
like Grevilka robusta;
â¢ Plant the grass or tree seedlings/shrubs.
Management
â¢ It is recommended that at the end of the rainy season, the structures should
be repaired. With time, soil refills the trenches and should be scooped out.
â¢ Prune the trees and shrubs to reduce possible shading of surrounding crops.
The shrubs can be pruned at knee-height at the end of each rainy season.
â¢ Patches without grass should also be re-planted. The topsoil on the band
can be covered with banana leaves for a week before re-planting grass. This
makes the soil moist and warm so the planted grass establishes easily.
Limitations
â¢ The establishment and management of the earth work structures requires
a lot of labour. However, as the explanation by one farmer of Munaku
Kaama group of Masaka district and William Matovu (Box 4) of Mbarara
suggest, reciprocal labour from clan/women groups can reduce the labour
constraints.
â¢ The trees and shrubs may harbour pests and diseases for crops.
â¢ Skills for proper layout and management of the earth works are necessary.
59

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
Box 5 Earthworks for soil and water management: Mr. Matovu's experience
Degradation of land in most parts of Uganda has reduced crop yields to very low levels.
However, by applying soil and water conservation practices, the value of such land can
be restored. Mr. Matovu William of Mbarara district has achieved this type of
restoration.
Matovu comes from Kashungwe village, Bugamba sub-county in Mbarara district. In
1976, the owner of the land in which Matovu is settled sold the land to him and moved
to Bunyoro. The owner sold the land because it was not fertile and yields of crops were
too low. Since 1994, Matovu started constructing earthworks to improve his land. "Fanya
Chini" is the type of earthwork on Matovus' family farm. His reason for constructing
"Fanya Chini" was that they are simpler to construct compared to "Fanya Juu" and other
farmers too were constructing the "Fanya Chini". In addition, labour for constructing
earth works is expensive and he was relying on group labour.
He belongs to the Kashungwe Farmers Group. This group is comprised of
representatives from 16 families in the village. The group was taught the values of soil
and water conservation structures on slopy land and how to layout the contours and
construct the structures by the Uganda Soil Conservation and Agroforestry Pilot Project
(USCAPP). With the help of the group, Matovu constructed "Fanya Chini" on 1-acre
portion of the land where he grows bananas. The dimensions of the channels are 60 cm
wide and 30 cm deep. Labour provided by the group saved him Uganda Shillings
20,000/= per 30 metres length that he would have paid to hire labour.
The benefits that Matovu family has obtained by constructing the earthworks for soil and
water conservation are numerous. From land that could not yield much, he has been able
to obtain good income, from various farming activities in his farm.
The 60-year-old farmer has been able to provide for his family of 9 children, his wife and
himself. He keeps 16 cattle of local breed and cuts the Setaria grass on the bunds 3-5
times a year, depending on the weather, this grass is used to feed his animals.
When the previous owner came back, he saw the improved farm and wished he could
get it back. Matovu appreciates the role of earthworks in improving productivity of land,
but notes that labour for establishment and management is a major constraint.

Technical Handbook No.21
Improved fallows in annual cropping land
Some farmers in the banana- coffee farming zone of Uganda currently leave a
portion of their land to rest after continuous cropping for long periods, because
they have noticed a decline in productivity on these sites. The resting of land is
mainly aimed at restoring soil fertility. Legume crops such as Mucuna, lab-lab,
Mpinamiti/ Nkoolimbo (Cajanus cajan)
and legume tree crops such as
Muzimbandeya [Sesbania sesbari), Calliandra [Calliandra calothyrsus), Crotolaria
[Crotolariagrahamiana) and Tephrosia [Tephrosia vogelii) species, are used to improve
existing fallow systems. These plants give additional benefits like reducing soil
erosion, controlling weeds [Striga asiatica) , supplying firewood, nutrient cycling
and adding organic matter to the soil. The fallow also provides fodder for animals
tethered on the fallow land.
Muzimbandeya [Sesbania sesbari) fallows do best in relatively deep soils of medium
texture ( sandy loam or clay loam), but less well in sandy, shallow or stony soils.
Fallows do not establish well in soils that are low in nutrients especially
phospohorus. In the first year, trees can be planted and grown with the maize
crop. Once established trees are thinned to a lm x lm spacing. The trees are
allowed to grow for 2 to 3 years, by this time they will have grown to about 5m
tall, and will have produced a large amount of fallen leaves and firewood. The
trees are then clear cut, and the field can again be planted to agricultural crops.
Best effects have been noted if the fallow is followed by a crop of maize.
Muzimbandeya fallows can be established by direct seeding or with potted or
bare-rooted seedlings. Most of the fallow species establish well with seeds. An
exception is Calliandra that is best established from seedlings (potted or bare
root). To establish fallows from seeds put 2 -3 seeds in a planting hole and cover
with little soil. Thin the germinated seedlings after 2 -3 weeks to one per hole.
For a fallow to establish well, a bacteria in the soil called Rhizobium needs to be
present. This bacteria is available in places where there are natural stands of
Muzimbandeya [Sesbania sesbari) or beans . If the fallows are to be planted in lands
previously under these crops, they will automatically be infected with Rhizobium.
This bacteria, can also be found around well -established wild or planted
Muzimbandeya [Sesbania sesbari) trees. The bacteria are found in the soil close to
the surface (0-15 cm), around the small lumps found on the young roots close to
the tree. Surface soil collected from around these well established trees can be
mixed into the soil used for potting seedlings, or in bare-rooted beds. It is more
difficult to make this bacteria available to seed that has been broadcast in the
61

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
field. Soil from around mature Muzimbandeya (Sesbania sesbari) trees can be
placed in the seed planting holes.
The main benefit of the Muzimbandeya (Sesbania sesbari) fallow is that it restores
soil fertility. The trees produce 6 tonnes of fallen leaves per year. These leaves
provide needed food for the soil. After clearing, the roots of the trees also remain
in the soil and as they rot over time also provide food for the soil. The improved
soil fertility also greatly reduces the presence of Striga weed in fields that have
been fallowed, in some cases getting rid of the weed entirely. The effects of the
fallow lasts up to three cropping seasons after it has been clear cut. This
agroforestry practice is therefore most effective as part of a regular rotation of
crops in annual cropping fields. Muzimbandeya {Sesbania sesban) fallows promote
nematodes in some soils, especially sandy soils. These nematodes reduce yields of
beans and tomatoes if they follow immediately after the Muzimbandeaya
{Sesbania sesbari) fallow. Maize is not affected by these nematodes. It is therefore
recommended to plant maize immediately after the fallow is clear. Beans and
tomatoes can be planted again after one season of maize.
Improved fallows may not be the best option for improving soil fertility, for
farmers with smaller areas of annual cropping land. For farmers that prefer to
grow their crops every year, and not to leave land fallow, composting and organic
manures, as described in earlier sections of this book, may be better options.

Multipurpose Trees in Banana-Coffee Gardens
A. Multipurpose Trees
Introduction
Like home gardens, multi purpose trees in banana-coffee gardens is a common
agroforestry practice in Uganda. However, the density of trees in banana-coffee
system is low compared to the situations in the home gardens. Some of the
multipurpose trees and shrubs common in farmlands are listed in Table 6a and
6b. The products and services commonly obtained from these trees are also listed.
Expected benefits
â¢ Provide products of commercial or subsistence value. Some of these are
listed in Table 6a and 6b;
â¢ Provide services such as soil fertility improvement, soil and water
conservation, improvement of microclimate resulting in increased crop
yields;
â¢ Many different types of products and services can be obtained from the
same piece of land;
â¢ Products and services can be obtained on a regular basis for a long time.
The banana-coffee systems can be sustained for a long period of time.
Description and design
The maintenance of scattered trees on cropland is a traditional practice
throughout the banana-coffee farming system. Scattered multipurpose trees on
cropland are perceived to compete minimally or not at all with the companion
crops. The bark-cloth trees like Mutuba (Ficus natalensis) are planted among banana
and coffee for production of bark-cloth and provision of services such as
windbreaks support for vines, improvement of soil fertility, and creation of a
favourable microclimate for crops. Trees suitable for growing in the Lake Victoria
Crescent of the banana-coffee farming system are: Mutuba (Ficus natalensis), Musizi
(Maesopsis eminii), Nsambya (Markhamia lutea), Muzimbandeya (Sesbania sesban) and
castor oil trees. Closer to the homesteads fruit trees like Muwafu (Canarium
schweinfurthii), Vanguna infausta, Mutugunda (Vangueria apiculata), Muziru (Pseudospondias
microcarpa), Garcinia apiculata, Mango/Muyembe (Mangifera indica), Guava/Mapeera
(Psidium guajava), Fene (Artocarpus heterophyllus), Avocado (Persea americana), and
Pawpaw/Paapali (Carica papaya) are commonly planted. In the dry areas north of
Lake Victoria crescent and in Iganga and Kamuli districts, Mukunyu (Ficus
sycomorus), Mugavu (Albizia coriaria), Muvule (Milicia excelsa), and Mukoge (Tamarindus

Agroforestry Handbook/or the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
indica) are deliberately retained by farmers on farm lands. In drier parts of
M b a r a r a and Bushenyi, Mukebu (Cordia ajricanum), Nsambya (Markhamia lutea), Musasa
(Sapium elipticum) and Castor oil/Ensogasoga [Croton macrostachyus) are commonly
grown. Other species grown in the banana-coffee farming system include:
Grevillea, Casuarinajunghuhniana and Musenene (Podocarpusgracillor). Scattered trees on
cropland may also be combined with earthwork structures for soil and water
conservation.

It is recommended that if trees are being introduced, they should be planted 1 Om
by 10m apart. This leaves room for land clearing and weeding activities.
Competition between trees and companion crops is also reduced. Naturally
growing trees should be cut-down to the recommended spacing. At this spacing,
100 to 200 trees can be planted in lha of land. Figure 20 illustrates the spacing
of trees grown together with coffee and bananas.
Management
Scattered trees on cropland are individually managed to obtain products
and services desired by a farmer.
The trees need to be protected from animals either individually or by
protecting the entire field.
Young trees need to be weeded. Spot weeding is sufficient.
Tree seedlings need to be protected from grazing animals, pests diseases
and fire.

B. Vanilla Production
Introduction
The vanilla agroforestry system is practised in the banana-coffee zone, and
integrated into the coffee, banana and home garden system. Vanilla (Vanilla
jragrans) is a creeper vine believed to have been introduced into Uganda from the
then Ceylon in 1912. Commercial production started in the 1930s. Though
production drastically declined during the civil strife in the 1970s, production by
small-scale farmers was revived at the beginning of the 1990s, largely because of
67

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee zone of Uganda
increased efforts of agricultural extension and non-governmental organisations.
Vanilla is currently grown in areas close to L. Victoria shores in the districts of
Mukono, Mpigi, and to a lesser extent, Masaka and Jinja districts.
Benefits from Vanilla system
â¢ Growing of Vanilla does not affect production of companion crops like
bananas and coffee. Vanilla can therefore be grown as an additional crop to
the main crops on the same piece of land;
â¢ Vanilla is a high value crop with a high potential to generate cash for farmers;
â¢ Vanilla can grow in a wide variety of soils;
â¢ The crop is easy to maintain; and
â¢ It has few pests and diseases.
Description and design
The vanilla agroforestry system consists of upper-storey shade trees, perennial
crops like coffee and bananas. The common upper-storey shade trees are Mutuba
(Ficus natalensis), Nlugavu (Albizia coriaria), Albizia chinensis, Musizi (Maesopsis eminii) and
Kifabakazi (Spathodea campanulata).
Vanilla grows best in loamy soils. It is planted under the shade trees amongst
coffee and banana trees. It is recommended that Vanilla vines be planted 3-5
meters apart. In the following section, details on how to establish a Vanilla farm
are discussed.
Establishment of a Vanilla farm
Support trees
Vanilla being a perennial vine requires trees for support. Trees which are planted
to provide shade should not be used as support trees.
Kinowa is the best support tree and is used by most farmers. Other support trees
include: Manihot esculenta (cassava), Mutuba (Ficus natalensis), MuLuluza (Vernonia
amuydalina), Gliricidia sepium, Gasiya (Senna species) and Cedrella odorata. Sticks and dead
branches can also be used but are not durable. There are many reasons why Kinowa
(Jatropha curcas) is considered the best support tree for Vanilla. Kinowa is easy to
propagate using cuttings, and its extensive branches provide shade needed by
Vanilla, It does not grow to a tall tree and can be used as a live fence. It is resistant
to termites.
68

Technical Handbook J\fo.21
Propagation
â¢ Vanilla requires shade and shade trees should be planted early and let to
establish before planting Vanilla.
â¢ The support trees should also be planted before planting Vanilla.
â¢ Vanilla vines which are facing upwards are selected as planting material
(seed).
â¢ Vanilla is planted using cuttings of one metre in length, during the
beginning of the rainy season.
â¢ Maximum yield may be reached after seven to eight years while economic
yields can be obtained for 10â20 years.
â¢ Roots of Vanilla are close to the soil surface. They should be protected from
possible damage during cultivation and feeding chicken by mulching.
Management
After Vanilla is established, management needs are limited except for pollination
which requires a lot of labour and good skills. Flowering and pollination are the
most important and difficult processes in Vanilla growing. Flowering is induced
by a dry season. Looping and cutting off the tip of the apical shoot of the vanilla
improves flowering. Flowering
takes place over two to three
months. The male and female
parts are located on the same
flower. The male part is located
above the female part. Because
there are no natural pollinators,
pollination is done by hand.
Each flower has to be carefully
opened using a sharp object,
and the male and female parts
brought into contact. Figure 22

Agroforestry Handbook/or the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
When the pods are formed, thinning is necessary to avoid over-bearing. About
6-7 pods give a good vanilla yield.
The pods mature in 9 to 10 months after pollination. They are then harvested just
before ripening and sold directly to vanilla processors who export the product.
Pollination of Vanilla
â¢ Locate mature vanilla flowers.
â¢ With a sharp object, cut and expose the female (ovary) and male (anther)
parts of two adjacent flowers.
â¢ Make contact between the two parts from the different flowers.
â¢ Allow the flowers to close.
Uses of Vanilla
â¢ Vanilla is grown primarily for the export market for use as flavouring for
cakes, sweets and icecream.
â¢ For local use, the mature pod is harvested, dried and used to flavour tea and
cakes.
Limitations to vanilla growing
Every flower is pollinated individually and this requires a lot of labour. Skill is also
needed during pollination to ensure the correct contact between the male and
female parts of the flower. Marketing of vanilla pods is a problem because there
are very few buyers. The price of vanilla has reduced from Shs. 10,000/= per kg
of raw vanilla beans during 1992-93 period to only Shs. 2,500/= per kg in
1996/97. But, as Kabali Deogratius explains in Box 6, the marketing problem
should not discourage farmers from growing vanilla. Growing of vanilla is still
profitable because the activity does not exclude cultivation of other crops.
Box 6 Growing of Vanilla: the experience of Mr. Kabali Deogratius
Vanilla is a very special crop. It is valued for the flavour produced by the seeds in the
pods. The growing of vanilla requires good skills especially for pollination. But for
experienced farmers, says Kabali Deogratius, growing of vanilla is not difficult.
Kabali is a farmer from Kabembe village in Kyampisi sub-county, Mukono district.
He owns 2 acres (0.8 ha) of land. On 1 acre (0.4 ha), he grows vanilla together with
bananas and coffee. The price of vanilla in Uganda has been decreasing. But farmers
continue to grow vanilla even though the price has been declining. Kabali Deogratius
started growing vanilla in 1992. His main reason for deciding to grow vanilla was the
70

Technical Handbook No.21
income from the crop in the early 1990s. He started growing vanilla in 1 acre out of
his 2-acre farm. First half acre of vanilla was established in 1992. In 1994, he
expanded the area by another half-acre. Although the price of vanilla continued to
fall, Kabali still expanded the vanilla farm; and he had good reasons for growing
vanilla despite the low market price. The reasons relate to the advantages of vanilla
in terms of labour requirements and compatibility with other food crops.
Establishing a vanilla farm
Vanilla requires shade to grow. Therefore, before planting vanilla, crops that can
provide shade should be planted first. Kabali established vanilla in a plot that had no
trees. To provide shade, he first planted bananas. Bananas can grow and provide shade
within three months after planting. Support trees spaced 8ft (2.3m) apart within a row
were then planted. Rows can be spaced 6 ft (2m) apart. This spacing is also the spacing
of the vanilla vines during planting. Kabali planted Kiryowa/kinowa (Jatropha curcas),
a tree used by most farmers for supporting vanilla. Farmers believe that
Kiryowa/kinowa (Jatropha curcas) has a special good association with vanilla. The
smooth bark is said to encourage good growth and yield of vanilla. In the following
section, we describe how vanilla is grown and the associated benefits as described by
Kabali Deogratius, a vanilla farmer.
Obtaining vine cuttings for planting
It is important to obtain the correct types of vines for planting. Vines for planting
should be obtained from those facing upwards. These are the growing vines. Vines,
which face downwards are at the stage of producing pods. These should not be used
for planting.
Dig holes 2ft deep and 2 ft wide close to the support trees. Cut the vines into sections
each of three inter-nodes length. Remove leaves from up to two nodes and bury the
vine to cover the two nodes with soil. Tie the vine to the support tree.
Management
When the vines are about 6 feet long, they should be bent and a section buried in the
soil. This starts a second growing loop. The Gft height is used so that hand pollination
is possible. Six loops can grow in 18 months. Vanilla flowering can be induced either
naturally by dry weather or manually by nipping mature buds. Harvesting mature
beans is done by hand. The beans are sold fresh.
Pollination
Pollination of vanilla is the most critical management activity and requires good skills.
The male and the female parts of the vanilla plant are located on the same flower but
in different sections. The flower is enclosed so other pollination agents like insects and
birds cannot reach it. It is important to know the location of the male and female
71

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
parts and how to handle them during pollination. The male part is located at the top
of the column of the flower and the female part is located in the lower part of the
same column.
Using the tip of a sharp v-shaped object like a safety pin or a stick, carefully open the
column of the flower. Using one finger, bend the funnelled top of the flower and
touch it with the female part located on the lower part of the flower column. Press
with the thumb to ensure contact.
Pollination should be done in the morning hours. During this period, the pollen
containing structures are not soggy and chances of successful pollination are high. If
pollination is not successful, the flowers drop after three days.
Pods form after successful pollination. It takes 9 months for the pods to mature. It is
therefore important to keep records so as to know the expected maturity period. The
pods form a cluster. One cluster can have about 20 pods. It is advisable to leave only
6 to 8 pods in one cluster to obtain good quality vanilla.
Benefits
Although vanilla is a high value crop, the marketing is a problem. Vanilla is mainly
an export crop and there are few firms that buy vanilla. Kabali sells his crop at 2,500
UShs per kilogram. This is the price when the product is delivered to the market.
Despite the low price, farmers continue to expand acreage of land for growing
vanilla. This is because vanilla is just companion crop of other main crops. The
income from vanilla therefore supplements income from other crops. For example, in
the case of Kabali, in 1994, only twov years
after planting an acre of vanilla, he earned
40,000/- UShs from selling vanilla at 5000/-
per Kg. Kabali suggests that the farm gate
price of vanilla can be improved if vanilla-
growing farmers organised themselves and
formed a marketing co-operative society.
This would create a better opportunity for
exporting vanilla directly by farmers.
The other advantage of growing vanilla is
that the crop does not require a lot of labour
except during pollination. In addition, two
crops can be harvested in one year. In 1998,
for example, Kabali harvested 100 Kg from
his acre farm and earned 250,000 USh. He
has known the benefits of growing vanilla
Mr. Kabali Deogratius in his vanilla farm and is expanding the farm.

Technical Handbook No.21
Commercial Woodlots and Wood Production
Introduction
Commercial woodlots can be of a single species or of different types of trees. In
Mukono, Mpigi, Masaka and Rakai districts, woodlots of Kalitunsi (Eucalyptus
species), and stands of different species as well as remnants of natural forests are
common. In other districts like Mbarara where farmers own large pieces of land,
Pine/Kinazi (Pinuspatula), Musizi (Maesopsis eminii), Grevillea and Cupressus lustanica are
grown. In Bushenyi where rearing cattle is a major land use activity, woodlots of
Kalitunsi are found interspersed in paddocks and banana-coffee fields. Generally,
in the banana-coffee farming zone, Kalitunsi is a common tree planted as a
woodlot. This is because it grows fast, re-grows easily after cutting and the
products have a ready market. Kalitunsi woodlots are grown to produce poles,
fuelwood, and timber.
Expected benefits
Benefits from planted woodlots cannot just be quantified in terms of income only.
The experience of one farmer from Mabira village, Nyarubungo II parish,
Nyakaizo sub-county in Rwampara county, Mbarara district illustrates the value
of woodlots (Box 7). Some of the benefits expected from woodlots are:
â¢ Cash income and other economic gains;
â¢ Security of tenure of both land and trees;
â¢ Provision of tree products including fuelwood for home consumption and sale;
â¢ In the long run, increased income is obtained because of saved labour costs
and repeated harvest;
â¢ Improved microclimate;
â¢ Control of soil erosion;
â¢ Soil fertility improvement;
â¢ Use of unproductive sites;
â¢ Beautify landscape;
â¢ Wind breaks;
â¢ Boundary marking.
Woodlots are grown as a form of fallow. Kalitunsi (Eucalyptus species) and Nsambya
(Markhamia lutea) are good trees for establishing woodlots because their products
like poles, timber and firewood are easy to market. In addition, Kalitunsi grows
well in swampy areas where other crops cannot be grown.
Other trees that can be grown as woodlots apart from Kalitunsi and Nsambya are
73

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
Grevillea, Lira (Melia azedarach), Mugavu (Albizia coriaria), Nongo (Albizia zygia) , Cedrella
odorata, Umbrella tree (Terminalia spp.) and Musenene (Podocarpus gracillor). Products
from woodlots can be sold or used in the household to reduce expenditure on
fuelwood; poles for fencing and construction.
Trees in woodlots are either grown at the same time with food crops, or are
planted on their own. Growing food crops in woodlots is only advisable during
the establishment phase of trees. Thereafter, because of the high population of
trees in woodlots, food crops are out-competed and yields decline. Commercial
woodlots can be single or mixed species stands that resemble dense natural growth.
Use of improved stoves combined with production on farm of fuelwood can
considerably reduce both time spent searching for fuelwood and the amount of
fuelwood used (See Box 7).
Box 7 Growing commercial woodlots: Augustine Mpuku's case
Firewood for domestic use is becoming scarce in most parts of Uganda. Most
households deliberately grow trees in blocks as woodlots. The benefits of woodlots is
known to some farmers, but often, these benefits are not quantifiable in the short-run
because trees take a relatively long time to mature compared to agricultural crops.
Most farmers therefore get discouraged from establishing large areas of woodlots
except for small scale undertaking to meet consumption needs. But woodlots are very
profitable as the narration by Augustine Mpuku from Mbarara District shows.
Mpuku is 50 years old. He resigned from formal employment at a prime age of 27
years in 1976. When he was employed, he saved money and bought land. Apart from
a small piece of land inherited from his farther, he has been able to increase the total
are of land he owns to 20 acres (8 ha). Since he resigned from employment, Mpuku
has taken care of his family of 11 people successfully. Sales of products from his farm
has enabled him to pay fees for his children. He pays USh 900, 000/= per year for
one child and expects to pay three times this amount when two of his children join
secondary school in the year 2000.
In 1992, Mpuku attended a World Environment Day meeting convened by the Local
District Council. During the meeting, farmers were urged to grow trees especially on
hill-tops and steep slopes. These are the main grazing lands for the Banyankole
community. The Banyankole mainly depend on livestock which is for production of
both milk and beef. Conservation of hills was therefore a major concern from the
community who have watched the hills turn bare with time because of over-grazing.
Mpuku took the advice seriously. The following year in 1993, he went to the Forest
74

Technical Handbook No. 21
Department and bought seedlings. He bought a few of different types of tree
seedlings. The price of the seedlings in Uganda shillings were: Kalitunsi (Eucalyptus
species) (50/=), Chlorophora excelsa (200/=), Cupressus lusitaniea (200/=), and
Pinc/Kinazi (Pinus patula) (200/=). To begin with, he bought just a few seedlings
because he could not afford many. He then decided to raise his own seedlings. He
gathered seeds from nearby fields and obtained some from the Forest Department.
He had several reasons for starting a commercial woodlot. First, he needed to
supplement his income from sale of banana and other food crops. But, he also found
value in protecting parts of his farm that were exposed to degradation through soil
erosion by planting trees. A third reason was that he wanted to respond to the call
by local council to set an example and earn the prestige of recognition.
Mpuku depends on his family for labour and only hires limited labour to accomplish
specific short-term tasks. To establish the woodlot using minimum labour, Mpuku
introduced trees in field prepared for growing food crops. As he grew and tended the
food crops, the trees were also tended. In this way, labour for establishing the 5 acre
woodlot was provided by the family. During the establishment of the woodlot,
Mpuku planned the farm carefully. The woodlot was established in the part of his
farm which is generally difficult to farm because the slope is steep. The establishment
of the woodlot was started in the less steep part of the farm so that most members
of the family including children could provide labour. He also planned and planted
the different types of trees in different blocks on the five acres. In this way, he spaced
each type of tree species according to his projection of the types of products that he
would harvest with time depending on the growth pattern of the trees. For trees like
Kinazij Musizi (Maesopsis eminii), Cupressus lusitaniea, Musenene (Podocarpus gracillor),
Kliaya anthotheca and Muvule (Milicia excelsa), which he considered to be relatively slow
growing compared to Kalitunsi, he spaced the trees at 4m x 4m. The Kalitunsi was
spaced at lm x lm so that thinnings could be harvested after a few years.
Growing of food crops in the woodlot was discontinued after competition from trees
reduced crop yields. Mpuku continued to manage the woodlot after he discontinued
growing crops. He pruned the trees to about two thirds of their height. He also did
spot weeding. After a while, labour became constraining because most of his children
went to study away from home. He has had to hire labour to slash the undergrowth
in the plantations during the wet season. He hires labour at USh 1000/= per day. The
slashing takes about three days and is done twice in a year. But, according to Mpuku,
labour is still very limiting because he cannot afford to hire labour continuously. Yet,
because of the warm and wet climate, weeds grow very fast. Some of his trees were
choked by weeds, but weeding bananas is given priority because he sells bananas
throughout the year. Bananas also provide food for the family.
75

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
Mpuku is however happy with his
efforts in establishing the woodlot.
He recounted the benefits from the
woodlot with pride. He had been
obtaining firewood from the woodlot
for household use. He first harvested
three lorry loads of firewood for sale
from the Kalitunsi plot in 1997: only
four years after planting. He earned
USh 1,050,000/=. People are now
aware that Mpuku has a good
woodlot. Buyers go to his farm. He
sells poles. One pole costs USh
1,000/= at the farm. He had sold 8
of them in early 1999. He also sells whole trees at USh 1,500/= each. He had
recently sold 20 and earned USh 30,000/=. In April 1999, he thinned the section of
the woodlot with Pine and used the thinnings for constructing a pig rearing unit. This
saved him money.
Assuming that 2000 Kalitunsi seedlings planted by Mpuku had been bought, he
would have spent USh 100,000/=. Labour was provided by the family and can be
assumed to have had no cost to the Mpuku family. Hence the cost of establishing the
Kalitunsi section of the woodlot can be estimated at USh 200,000/= including the
cost of seeking information from the Forest Department. At the planting density of
lm by lm (3ft by 3ft) for Kalitunsi, Mpuku can generate USh 2 million from an acre
of land. So for him, his benefits are worth the effort he made.
The success of the Mpuku family has not been easy to achieve. They have
experienced some problems with the woodlot. Apart from labour limitations:
â¢
Neighbours have been stealing trees from the woodlot;
â¢
The cattle tracks enforced by the Local Councils expose the woodlot to
potential illegal harvesters;
â¢
In distant farms where he started expanding the woodlot enterprise, fires have
been a problem. In the case of the Mpuku family, when their neighbours burn
their fields, fire often gets to his woodlot and he is not compensated by the
neighbours. But other farmers reported that neighbours can also set woodlots
on fire to ensure availability of grazing land for their cattle;
â¢
Poor roads and lack of transport make it impossible for the Mpuku family to
sell wood products from their woodlots in distant market where they can fetch
better prices.
76

Technical Handbook No.21
Establishment
A woodlot should be located on the less productive parts of the farm; like on steep
slopes and on land with poor soils. When planted near homesteads, it is advisable
to plant the trees against the direction of wind as shown in Figure 23. This
protects houses and other structures in a home from destruction by wind.
Figure 23 Trees in woodlot planted against direction of wind
Establishing a large woodlot requires a lot of resources, especially labour and tree
seedlings. But, there is an easier and cheaper method as described by a farmer
from Mbarara Box 7. The trees can be established by planting seedlings on a
cultivated field or by selectively cutting some of the trees already growing in the
field and introducing the desired type of trees. Initially, the trees should be spaced
2m x 2m. The spacing can be increased by thinning.
Management
Weeding, pruning and thinning are the three most important management
activities on a woodlot. In Tables 8a and 8b the period when the three
management operations should be done during a growing cycle of Kalitunsi
(Eucalyptus species) and Nsambya (Markhamia lutea) are listed.

Pest and Disease Control in Agroforestry
In agroforestry like other types of agriculture, there is risk of pest and disease out-
break. This section outlines the general pest and disease control practices in
agroforestry. Pests can affect the companion crops and trees. In this manual, we
discuss pests that affect trees in agroforestry. It is considered that control of pests
that affect agricultural crops is well covered in other books on agriculture.
Farming practices to prevent pest and disease outbreaks
â¢ Use healthy planting material
Seeds or the planting material can carry some diseases. Therefore, choose
only healthy seed and planting material.
Diseased plants should be removed and destroyed to avoid infecting healthy
plants.
â¢ Choose resistant varieties
Select crop varieties that are resistant to common pests and diseases. Local
varieties of crops are more resistant to pests and diseases compared to
modern varieties.
Plant at the right time
Timely planting, weeding and thinning can be beneficial. It is advisable to
plant early so that crops establish well before the peak of the rain season.
This is the period when crops are most susceptible to attack by pests and
particularly diseases.
Inter-planting
When only one type of crop or variety is grown, it may be completely
wiped out by a pest attack. But if different types of crops or several varieties
of the same crop are grown, some may be resistant and survive.
In some cases, suitable crops can be inter-planted with locally available
toxic or insect repellent plants. For example, Neem (Azadirachta indica) has
been known to repel insects when inter-planted with maize.
83

Agroforestry Handbook for the Banana-Coffee Zone of Uganda
â¢ Crop rotation
If the same crop is planted on the same piece of land every year, the pests
and diseases that attack that crop tend to multiply. Instead, grow a different
crop each season. This will reduce the number of pests and diseases, since
most do not attack different types of crops.
â¢ Apply organic manure
The use of compost, mulch, and green manure crops can have a very
positive effect against pests and disease. It has been found that proper
mulching of the crops, besides conserving moisture, provides alternative
food to pests like termites. This is effective for short term crops like beans,
maize and sorghum. Mulch can also cause the pest population to rise thus
exposing the crop to a more severe attack.
â¢ Plant trees or hedges as windbreaks
Besides breaking the wind, trees and shrubs moderate the temperature,
reduce evaporation and provide shelter and food for useful insects. Trees,
such as Grevillea, Mubimba/Muzimbandeya (Sesbania sesban) and Lusina (Leucaena
leucocephala) provide good shelter and wind protection. Tithonia (Tithonia
diversifolia) grown at the edge of plots has indicated positive effects in
repelling insects, besides being a potential green manure.
â¢ Plant different types of crops
Crops such as sunflower and finger millet, and also local plants which
bloom and bear fruit, attract birds and insects. When such crops are grown
at the edge of the field they attract the pests away from the main crop.
Controlling pest and disease outbreaks
Sometimes disease or pest out break cannot be avoided. At such times, a farmer
must intervene to prevent crops from being destroyed. This can be done in
various ways.
Hand-picking
Large insects can be collected by hand. This is possible only if the number of
pests is not large, and they have not become too widespread on the crops. Banana
farmers have perfected the method of collecting the banana weevils from
harvested banana stems.
84

Technical Handbook No.21
Pesticides
Often the insect/disease attack require the use of synthetic pesticides, (e.g.,
FURADAN is used by farmers to control banana weevils and termites.) However
many of these pesticides are very difficult for nature to break down, are expensive
and have negative side effects on human health when improperly handled. They
should therefore be used as a last resort when a pest outbreak threatens to wipe
out the entire crop or for selective spot-control of difficult pests or diseases to
prevent them from spreading. Consult a local Agricultural/Forestry Extension
Officer before using synthetic pesticides.
Toxic plant extracts
Some plant parts like seeds, fruit, leaves or ashes can be made into solutions that
can be sprayed or watered on the crops to prevent or reduce attacks of various
insects and diseases. Chilli (Capsicum annum) has been used as an effective insect
repellent by many farmers against the cut worm and other insects. Many
repellents are effective in protecting crops during storage.
Wood ash applied on bean leaves has been shown to control pest infection. A
mixture of wood ash and cow urine is known to control banana weevils. Kabale
farmers use extracts from Pyrethrum flower heads to control pests in beans and
maize. Extracts from tobacco, rich in nicotine kill many insect pests. In Box 9 the
use of Neem extracts to control pests is described.
Biological control
Some insect infestation can be controlled through use of predatory organisms.
However this is yet a relatively new invention.
The wasp {Epidinocarsis lopezi) has been used to control the cassava mealy bug. The
wasp lays eggs inside adult mealy bug (Phenacoccus manihoti) which die as the egg
develops.
Phytoseiids (predatory mites) are effective in controlling, by feeding on the cassava
green mite {Mononychellus tanajoa).

Box 9 Neem for pest control
Different parts of the Neem tree can affect many insect species, some nematodes,
fungi, bacteria and viruses. Neem contains several active chemicals which work in
different ways, therefore, pests are unlikely to become resistant to Neem. One of the
active chemicals in Neem is called azadirachtin.
Neem is easy to prepare and use and is environmentally safe as well as harmless to
man and animals. Neem extracts usually change the insect pests' feeding and life
cycle so that eventually they are not able to live and reproduce.
Neem is most useful against pests that feed on plants. It is very effective against
grasshoppers, leaf and leaf hoppers. The Neem extract is most effective against
beede larvae, butterfly and moth caterpillars. Neem can also be used in grain storage.
A. Use of N e e m leaves
Neem use for storing grain:-
â¢
Dry Neem leaves in the sun so that they stay green.
â¢
Grind the leaves into a powder; mix the powder with clay and water.
â¢
Plaster the inside walls of the storage container with the mixture and allow to
dry.
â¢
Place a layer of Neem leaves which have been dried in the shade on the bottom
of the container.
â¢
Fill the container with grain; place a layer of dried Neem leaves on top and
close the storage container.
â¢
If the grain is stored in sacks, Neem leaf powder can be mixed directly with
the grain in the ratio of approximately 1â 2kg powder to 100kg of grain.
B. Use of N e e m seed cake
Preparing crushed Neem seed
1. The ripe fruit pulp should be removed from the seed as soon as possible after
harvest, orherwise the seeds may become covered in mould. In some areas
birds or fruit bats eat the pulp leaving the seed on the ground.

Technical Handbook No.21
2. The seeds should then be laid out in a thin layer in the sun to dry out for a few
days. The dried seeds should be stored in containers with plenty of air to stop
mould growing.
3. The shells have to be removed using stones or a big mortar. The shells can then
be removed by winnowing in the same way as with cereals.
4. The kernels are then ground in a mill or in a mortar.
Use of N e e m to control stem borers on young plants:-
1. A small amount of crushed neem seed powder
should be mixed with the same amount of dry
clay or sawdust.
2. The mixture is placed in the funnel
young maize or sorghum plants.
3. Rain will gradually dissolve
the active chemicals in the
neem seed.
4. This treatment may need to
be repeated every 8 to 10
days until the plants flower.
C . U s e o f N e e m w a t e r extract for p l a n t protection
â¢
Prepare 500g of crushed seed kernels as described previously.
â¢
Mix crushed seed with 10 litres of water. It is necessary to use lots of water
because the active ingredients do not dissolve easily.
â¢
Stir the mixture well.
â¢
Leave to stand for at least 5 hours.
â¢
Spray the Neem water directly on vegetables using a sprayer or straw brush.
â¢
The effect lasts for 3 to 6 days. If kept in the dark,
Neem water will be effective for 3 to 6 days.
â¢
It has been estimated that 20-30kg Neem seed (an
average yield from 2 trees), can normally treat one
hectare.
â¢
If crops have to be watered, water should go directly
on the soil because water running over the leaves of
sprayed plants may wash off the extract
â¢ If alcohol is available, 50 times more azadirachtin can be
dissolved and extracted.
