AICCRA | EAFF Workshop Report - Key insights, opportunities and challenges for climate and agriculture  • 2
The EAFF, in partnership with
AICCRA, hosted a hybrid workshop
on 5 March 2024 for its member
organisations to discuss the
opportunities and challenges
arising from the most recent
climate change summit held in
Dubai in December 2023, namely
the 28th Conference of Parties
(COP28) meeting to the United
Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
This workshop report captures
the key messages, challenges and
opportunities highlighted during
the meeting, which are critical to
guide the EAFF and its member
organisations in their continued
work to drive the climate-
agriculture agenda towards COP29.
Introduction

Key expert reflections
of COP28
Elizabeth Nsimadala, President of
the EAFF, opened the meeting by reflecting
on COP28 from farmers’ perspective, noting
both positive and disappointing outcomes.
COP28 put food and agriculture high on
the agenda, with the launch of the United
Arab Emirates Declaration on Sustainable
Agriculture and Resilient Food Systems.
Farmers were included in various high-level
sessions and events, but their contributions
were not adequately acknowledged or
integrated into climate strategies.
However, farmers felt that their voices were
overlooked in climate action the Sharm el-
Sheikh Joint Work (SSJW) on Agriculture and
Food Security did not progress and farmers
were not mentioned in the outcome document
for the COP, raising questions about who
will drive food systems transformation and
how farmers can contribute without being
empowered and included in decision-making.
Looking ahead, farmers need to enhance their
engagement in both the SSJW negotiations,
as well as the discussions of the UNFCCC
Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)
and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and
Technological Advice (SBSTA). Farmers
also need to be central to climate policy
development and work towards stimulating
ambition in the next round of Nationally
Determined Contributions (NDCs). Securing
climate finance directly for farmers is crucial
for a just transition to resilient agri-food
systems. The EAFF remains committed
to climate discussions and will consult
stakeholders to strengthen their position.

Dr. George Wamukoya, Team
Leader of the Africa Group of
Negotiators Expert Support
(AGNES), emphasised the importance of
engaging with farmers in climate change
negotiations, as they are directly affected by
the outcomes.
Agriculture has been part of the negotiations
since 2007, leading to decisions like the Sharm
el-Sheikh Joint Work on Implementation
of Climate Action on Agriculture and Food
Security (SSJW).
However, there are challenges in a number
of areas, such as with the use of certain
terminologies around ‘food systems’, issues
related to coordination and in operationalising
decisions. The G77 and China, as well as the
Africa Group, seek a formal coordination
structure for implementation, unlike other
partners who prefer an informal one. This was
a sticking point. In addition, workshop topics
were suggested, that included sustainable
agriculture, means of implementation, and
fisheries. However, there is still no clarity on
the way forward.
The COP28 discussed the Global Stocktake
(GST) and the Global Goal on Adaptation
(GGA), setting targets for 2030 and beyond,
including for climate-resilient food production.
A two-year framework will develop indicators
to track adaptation, linking to national
adaptation planning processes and NDCs.
AGNES is working to increase the number
of Long-term Strategies (LTSs) in African
countries to inform NDCs.
Dr. Wamukoya  emphasised the need for
national farmer organisations (NFOs) to
engage in NDC committees, as budgetary
allocations and international funding align
with NDC priorities. AGNES can assist NFOs
in engaging with national focal points and
leaders. NFOs should engage early to be
part of national delegations and negotiate
for their priorities. Some civil society
representatives from farmer organisations
are part of their national delegations and
key negotiators for agriculture. AGNES writes
to governments to request the inclusion of
specific experts in national delegations. A
party badge accreditation is crucial for access
to negotiation rooms, allowing for potential
game-changing contributions.
Laura Cramer, Policy Engagement Specialist at
Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR’s Climate Research
for Africa, discussed the role of CGIAR, a research-for-development
organisation, in international climate negotiations.

While not negotiators themselves, CGIAR
scientists can inform and advise negotiators
by providing evidence to support decision-
making. CGIAR follows several tracks within the
negotiations, including the new collective goal
on finance, the GGA, the SSJW, the GST, and
Loss and Damage.
Cramer highlighted the importance of
using science to inform negotiations but
acknowledges that science is not neutral and
can be influenced by organisational positions.
CGIAR has been discussing the food systems
language with the AGNES group to better
Philip Kilonzo, Head of Policy
and Advocacy at the Pan African
Justice Alliance (PAJCA) reflected on
advocacy, activism, and engagement around
agriculture and food security at COP28 and in
international climate negotiations in general.
He emphasised the need for stronger
mobilisation of African countries and farmer
organisations to ensure that agriculture
receives the priority and importance it
deserves in climate discussions.
Kilonzo highlighted the challenges faced
in positioning agriculture within COP28,
noting that while there were strong positions
understand the challenges and find middle
ground. She encouraged farmer organisations
like EAFF to critically examine the food systems
concept and decide how to align their interests
and contribute to the discussion.
Partnerships are crucial and CGIAR is in talks
with EAFF about a possible joint submission for
the GGA. The International Livestock Research
Institute is working to influence the discussion
around livestock and climate change, adding
nuance to the narratives dominated by the
Global North. ILRI aims to highlight the role of
livestock in livelihoods, food security, and the
bio-circular economy in Africa and the Global
South.
on agriculture, they were not effectively
acted upon. He stressed the importance
of strengthening farmer engagement and
advocacy, particularly in influencing the
inclusion of agriculture in countries' NDCs.
He also discussed the need to mainstream
farmers within the implementation plan for
the Nairobi Declaration on Climate Change
(developed at Africa’s first Climate Summit
in September 2023) and he emphasized the
need for farmers to determine and define
clear matrices and indicators for assessing
agricultural and farmer progress under the
GGA. Kilonzo called for a cross-sectoral
approach to building resilience in agriculture,
linking it to broader issues such as water
resource management.
Finally, he highlighted the need to engage with
the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to ensure that
farmer institutions have access to funding for
locally led adaptation actions. Kilonzo noted
opportunities to leverage geopolitical dynamics
to strengthen agricultural investment in Africa
and drive the agriculture agenda forward.
meaning and address concerns raised by some
countries and negotiating blocs. She emphasised
the importance of including farmers in these
conversations.
Finally, Bowa noted that CGIAR has prioritized
tracks such as the GGA, agriculture, finance,
and gender at COP, and has documented
opportunities for engagement that may be useful
for farmer organizations looking to participate in
COP discussions.
Emma Bowa from CGIAR, discussed
the trend of COP Presidencies launching
initiatives alongside the negotiations.
She highlighted two such initiatives: the
Food and Agriculture for Sustainable
Transformation (FAST) initiative, under
the Egyptian Presidency at COP27, and
the Technical Cooperation Collaborative,
under the UAE Presidency at COP28.
These initiatives both aim to mobilise funds
and implement projects at the country
level to inform COP discussions and align
agriculture and food systems policies. Bowa
emphasised the importance of farmer
organisations being involved in these
initiatives as they provide opportunities
for tangible action on the ground and can
inform negotiations. She also  mentioned
that engagement opportunities exist
throughout the year, not just during
the main COP events, including expert
dialogues and workshops that CGIAR is
looking to partner with organisations on.
Regarding the use of food systems
terminology, Bowa suggested that
unpacking the key elements of food
systems could help others understand its

In conclusion, Elizabeth Nsimadala,
President of the EAFF emphasised
the need for farmers to be engaged at every
step of the process to ensure their concerns
are addressed. She noted that ongoing
discussions around the SSJW and the GGA
further highlight the opportunity for farmers
to play a role in shaping indicators and targets.
Nsimadala also mentioned the importance
of partnerships with organisations like PACJA,
AGNES and the CGIAR, as well as the need for
farmer organisations to mobilise and organise
early in preparation for COP29.
Nsimadala acknowledged the discussions around
livestock and the need to highlight its benefits and
contributions to adaptation. She also touched
on the relationship between Africa and Europe
in terms of trade, investments, and policies,
emphasising the need for candid discussions and
for the harmonisation of positions.
In closing, Nsimadala emphasised the importance
of commitment from national farmers'
organisations and the need for positions
presented by the EAFF to be grounded in the
work happening at the ground level. Enhancing
farmer engagement in climate action is essential
for addressing the challenges of climate change
and building resilient agricultural systems.

Conversations around
food and agriculture
without farmers at the
table will lead to no
practical action on the
ground unless we are
headed into a future of
producing food without
farmers.
Elizabeth Nsimadala, President of the EAFF
Key recommendations towards COP29
•	The Global Goal on Adaptation
(GGA) has a two-year framework
to develop indicators for tracking
adaptation. Farmer groups need to
communicate which indicators would
be appropriate for tracking progress in
terms of adaptation and mitigation in
the agriculture sector. This links to each
country’s national adaptation planning
processes and their NDCs.
Suggested action: AICCRA is
working collaboratively with EAFF
to jointly develop farmer-led
indicators for submission.
•	NFOs must form part of national
climate delegations. The EAFF must
work with the NFOs to contact the Ministry
of Environment in each country so that
they become a part of the national team
for drafting a common position.
Suggested action: AGNES,
and others, can officially write to
governments and request that
farmer experts are included in
their national delegations.
PACJA can also assist NFOs make
these linkages with government
through their contact with
national committees.
•	For the EAFF, as a collective and unifying
voice for farmer organisations, it is
important to critically examine the
food systems terminology and
approach. It is important to consider
where it makes sense for EAFF to align
with the food systems terminology, what
it identifies as its common interests,
and to determine how to contribute to
discussions around food systems.
•	Farmer organisations should proactively
engage with governments and other
relevant stakeholders in the SSJW
negotiations, SBSTA and SBI meetings.
Suggested action: AGNES
is hosting a meeting in Nairobi
from 9 to 12 April 2024 to
address key areas of climate
negotiations, such as adaptation
finance, climate finance, health,
and biodiversity. It will be useful
for farmer organisations to attend
this meeting and to contribute to
its outcomes.
•	The next iteration of updated NDCs will
be submitted in early 2025, ahead
of COP30. This presents an engagement
opportunity for farmers to ensure their
priorities are included and that the potential
of the agriculture sector for climate change
adaptation is at the forefront. It is essential
that farmers and farmer organisations are
central to the NDC process as budgetary
allocations and international funding
are aligned with the NDCs. NFOs have a
responsibility to champion their priority
areas to inform the NDCs.
Suggested action: AGNES
can assist the EAFF members
to identify and liaise with the
national focal points and leaders
in their respective countries.
The ministries of agriculture are
responsible for coordinating and
collating evidence and priorities
for the sector.
•	Similarly, many African countries have
not yet developed their Long-term
Strategies, which presents another
opportunity for farmer organisations to
engage.

As farmers organisations
with members at the
national level, we need
to determine how we
can position ourselves
to engage in climate
policy development and
contribute meaningfully
to the revision of our
respective country
Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs).
Elizabeth Nsimadala, President of the EAFF
•	The EAFF and its members need to
engage the African Union as it works
towards the implementation of the Nairobi
Declaration, adopted at the Africa Climate
Summit in September 2023. There are still
gaps around defining transitional issues
such as agriculture.
Suggested action: EAFF to
collaborate more closely with the
African Union Commission to seize
opportunities that drive African
climate agendas forward.
•	Farmer organisations should leverage
favourable geopolitical dynamics
and close political relations,
like those between Africa and
Europe, in terms of trade, investment
and policies. It is important to unpack
how these opportunities can be used to
further relationships that are beneficial
for agricultural investment in Africa, as
well as assess when they are potentially
detrimental.
•	Conversations are needed to determine
how best to engage with the Green
Climate Fund to access funding for
farmer institutions. Funding needs to be
allocated to institutions that are proximate
to people on the ground and that can
support the implementation of locally-led
adaptation actions with the leadership of
farmers.
•	Farmer organisations need to
mobilise and organise themselves
to better engage with national level
institutions. Farmer organisations should
prioritise their issues and ensure common
positions are in alignment.
•	There are numerous COP Presidency
opportunities to consider engaging
with:
•	 The United Arabic Emirates
Framework for Global Climate
Resilience is an avenue to pursue
farmers’ interests by 2030. The
framework talks to achieving resilience
within multiple sectors, including the
need to broaden the conversation to
adopt a cross-sectoral approach.
•	 The Food and Agriculture for
Sustainable Transformation (FAST)
initiative is starting to mobilise funds.
Some of the initiatives are to be
implemented at the country level and
will be used to inform discussions
around the COP.
•	 The Technical Cooperation
Collaborative encourages
alignment of all agriculture and food
systems policies at the country level
and implements improvements for
tangible action on the ground. As
these initiatives unfold there will
be more opportunities for farmer
organisations to be involved and take
part in discussions.
•	The EAFF alone cannot do this.
Commitment is needed from the
NFOs as the positions must emanate
from work that is happening at the
ground level. In addition, it is important
to consider the immediate and long-term
impacts that climate change is causing at
the national level.
Suggested action: CGIAR,
AICCRA and others can
facilitate a workshop for
farmers to unpack and resolve
these issues.
•	Partnership development is
critical and there are many
that can be strategically and
mutually beneficial.
Suggested action: EAFF
to promote partnership
development with the CGIAR to
leverage its technical expertise
in various negotiating tracks,
as well as to jointly develop
proposals for bankable
projects and to ultimately
access climate funds.
EAFF to build strong
relationships with institutions
such as AGNES and the PACJA
that link farmer organisations
to national NDC committees
and ensure that invitations to
the relevant workshops are
issued.
•	Farmers need to engage actively
and strategically at COP. This
can strengthen farmer organisations
positions through the mobilisation
of diverse actors and differing
perspectives.
Suggested action:
Address nexus issues across
a wide array of themes and
stakeholder groupings. This
will ensure that the position
around agriculture for Africa
will be amplified in a cross-
sectional manner within the
COP itself.
