Abstract
National governments across East Africa are in the process of formulating and implementing
adaptation and mitigation strategies to assist farmers cope with climate change. These include
formulating actions, frameworks and programs to address climate change and embedding
these within the long-term national development plans. This working paper provides
understanding of the current state of national climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts
in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda for agriculture and provides baseline information
for subsequent assessments of climate change adaptation and mitigation.
In each country, specific government departments such as Environmental Protection
Authority (Ethiopia), Ministry of Environment, Water and Mineral Resources (Kenya), Vice
President’s  Office (Tanzania) and Ministry of Water and Environment (Uganda) are
mandated to coordinate climate change initiatives. In all countries, the Ministry of Agriculture
is the focal point for all climate change initiatives related to agriculture. Agricultural Sector
Development Plans that provide strategies to boost agricultural productivity and spur
economic growth have been prepared either as standalone plans or as part of National
Development Plans (NDP). Irrigation, capacity building, enhancing private-public partnership
for market development, and creating legal and regulatory environment that can attract
investments are some of the priority areas identified for attention in agriculture to enhance
climate resilience.
All countries have submitted draft National Adaptation Plan of Actions (NAPAs) and
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) to UNFCCC, indicating priority
interventions. Due to ineligibility to UNFCCC funding, Kenya initiated the National Climate
Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) and prepared a detailed National Climate Change
Adaptation Plan (NCCAP) that identified priority immediate, medium and long-term
adaptation strategies in agriculture and other sectors.
Government research institutions are equally actively involved. The Kenya Agricultural
Research Institute and Uganda Ministry of Water and environment have established Climate
Change Units, while the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research is taking pivotal role in
developing livestock and crop programs geared towards contributing to a Climate Resilient
Green Economy. Other initiatives include enhancing capacity of researchers and professionals

in climate change in East Africa, where training is offered by universities as part of their
curriculum and short courses in selected research institutions. However, the effectiveness of
these initiatives is hampered by lack of a clearly defined strategy and national policy. In
addition, there is lack of documentation of completed and on-going projects thus making it
difficult to coordinate initiatives and avoid duplications.
To fund climate change initiatives in agriculture, all governments across the region are
sourcing financing from various sources (other governments, foundations and research and
development organizations). However, Kenya also seeks financing from local sources within
the country such as the Local Authority Transfer Fund (LATF) and the Constituency
Development Fund (CDF).

1. Introduction
Changing climatic conditions are causing significant impacts on livelihoods, health, food
security, economic opportunities and the survival of humanity, especially in developing
countries. The poorest populations who are mainly rural based will be seriously and
disproportionately affected by the changing climate. Despite lack of sufficient scientific data,
there is no dispute that climate change is occurring right now across East Africa (Conway
2009). As the region strives to achieve sustainable development, national governments are
immensely grappling with difficult tradeoffs and opportunity costs with regard to climate
change (Müllera et al. 2011). The region will be hard hit by changing climate because of the
lack of economic, development and institutional capacity to deal with it (IPCC 2007). Indeed,
the effects of climate change are already being felt and its impacts have the potential to
undermine and even undo progress made in improving the socio-economic well-being of
residents of East Africa (Davidson et al. 2003).
The negative impacts associated with climate change are also compounded by many factors
including widespread poverty, human diseases, and high growth rates which are estimated to
double the demand for food, water, and livestock forage within the next 30 years (Davidson et
al. 2003). The above is reflected in the high percentage of people living below the poverty
line, ranging from 24.5% in Uganda to 45.9% in Kenya 45.9%1. The agricultural sector
contributes over 40% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in East Africa (Kadi et al. 2011).
In Ethiopia, agriculture remains the main contributor to GDP, contributing over 45% of the
GDP (Table 1). However in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, the rapid development of the
service sector2 has outpaced agriculture, contributing up to 61% of the GDP in Kenya.
Nevertheless, agriculture still accounts for over 75% of the labor force in all the four

Despite the importance of smallholder agriculture in these countries, there is limited
government effort to revitalize agriculture. For example, agriculture is mainly rain-fed and
total acreage of land cultivated under irrigation is very low. Yet, governments have made no
efforts to invest in irrigation. In Kenya and Uganda, for instance, the percentage of land under
irrigation is less than 4% (Kenya Vision 2030 2007, Republic of Uganda 2011). Moreover,
strategic empirical analysis that can guide policymakers and development practitioners in
their efforts to revitalize agriculture is scarce. This increases the vulnerability of the
agricultural production systems in the region to changes in climate
Smallholder farmers in East Africa pursue a wide range of crop and livestock enterprises that
vary across and within the major agro-ecological zones. Over 75% of the total agricultural
outputs are produced by smallholder farmers in Africa on an average farm size of about 2.5ha
(FAOSTAT, 2009). Forestry, horticulture and fishing are also important economic activities
in East Africa. In particular, horticulture is becoming the largest sector in the Kenyan
economy comprising of 240 large scale and 150,000 small scale farmers, with an annual
revenue of about USD 2 billion (English et al. 2004). Unfortunately, these activities face a
myriad of compounding challenges including low productivity (due to declining land quality),
inaccessible markets and information, prohibitive credit services, political instability, volatile
commodity prices among others. All these constraints deter smallholder farmers from
realizing their full potential and climate change adds onto these challenges.

3 The figures are for different years as follows: Kenya and Ethiopia 2005, Tanzania 2006 and Uganda 2009.

Climate modeling scenarios suggest an accelerated warming environment for East Africa at a
rate of about 0.05°C per decade with slightly more warming in the June–November seasons
than in December–May (Hulme et al. 2001, Christensen et al. 2007). Increase in the intensity
of high-rainfall events, associated in part with the increase in atmospheric water vapor, is also
expected (Christensen et al. 2007). In Ethiopia, climate models suggest drier conditions
(KNMI 2006). For Kenya and Uganda, climate models indicate a positive shift in rainfall
distribution during both rainy seasons (KNMI 2006, Thornton et al. 2006). Future climate
predictions from global climate models into the year 2100, show evidence of an increase in
the intensity of extreme rainfall events in much of East Africa, particularly in Kenya and
Uganda, whereby excess of 50% in 10-year high rainfall events are expected (KNMI 2006).
In southern Tanzania the wettest rainfall events are projected to decrease by 0% to 20%
(KNMI 2006). Average temperatures in Uganda are likely to increase by up to 1.5°C in the
next 20 years and by up to 4.3°C by the 2080s. This increase will lead to more frequent
intense rainfall, heat waves, droughts, floods and storms. However, uncertainty still exists in
relation to future projects of precipitation for East Africa.
Changes in climate coupled with poor market access, credit and skills, volatile commodity
prices, small land size, population pressure, low GDP and low investment in East Africa will
contribute to severe reduction in subsistence and commercial crop yields and livestock
products (IPCC 2001). It will further contribute to loss of food stock, land degradation and
fertility loss, high pre and post-harvest losses, increased incidences of pests and diseases and
invasive weeds (Simms 2005, Funk et al. 2005, IPCC 2001). In the livestock sector, the
changes in climate will contribute to inadequate pasture and water during drought, increased
incidence of livestock diseases and pests, conflict over water and grazing resources and
livestock death (Seo and Mendelsohn 2008, Jones and Thornton 2009). The fishery industry
will also be affected by receding water levels, silting and pollution of water bodies, loss of
fish species, reduction in fish quantity and quality, reduction in breeding grounds, depletion of
oxygen supply, and nitrification of water (Funk et al. 2005, Roessig et al. 2004). For water
bodies, climate change will lead to decreased water quantity in rivers and streams,
disappearance of glaciers on mountains by 2015 are equally projected (Vice  President’s
Office 2003, Thompson et al. 2002). Warming sea surface temperatures and sea-level rise in
the Indian Ocean will lead to the destruction of coral reefs, which are crucial for coastal

13
protection (IPCC 2001). Due to the changes in sea characteristics, mangroves trees are being
threatened and are becoming vulnerable.
In terms of human health, climate change in East Africa is expected to exacerbate the
occurrence and intensity of future disease outbreaks and may increase the spread of diseases
(IPCC 2001). Rainfall and unusually high maximum temperatures, for example, are positively
correlated with the number of malaria cases while the Rift Valley fever outbreaks are
positively correlated with El Nino events (Githeko and Ndegwa 2001, Zhou et al. 2004, Craig
et al, 2004, Patz et al. 2005). Biodiversity is also threatened as plant and animal species
struggle to adapt to changing climatic conditions (Malcolm et al. 2002, Lovett et al. 2005,
Hely et al. 2006, Thirgood et al. 2004). Reduction in resilience of plants to droughts has been
reported as well (Vanacker et al. 2005, Channel and Lomolino, 2000). Impacts of climate
change at national level will further affect local and international prices, in turn affecting food
demand, calorie availability, and ultimately human well-being (Herrero et al. 2010).
Furthermore, decline in agricultural productivity will certainly lead to increased food imports
leading to high food prices that most families cannot afford. This will translate into increased
child malnutrition, susceptibility to diseases and in some cases death. These scenarios present
the four countries in East Africa with the major task of increasing the adaptive capacity of
smallholders4. Therefore, these countries need to embrace and mainstream climate resilient
development pathways to reduce GHG emissions.
To address the above challenges posed by climate change and variability, governments in East
Africa have initiated various programs and projects. Climate change issues have been
integrated into the national development plans. Implementation of climate change adaptation
and mitigation strategies are underway to enhance agricultural productivity and economic
development. Examples include priority research, development and dissemination of drought,
heat and disease resistant crop varieties and livestock breeds. Other agricultural mitigation
and adaptation practices focus on tillage (such as minimum and/or no till), water conservation
and improving soil fertility. At the national policy level, efforts to ensure that climate change
activities and programs are integrated into and implemented in the development process are at

climate change (increased temperatures and rainfall) might extend the agricultural growing seasons (Thornton et al. 2006).

an early stage. In Kenya and Uganda, climate change units have been established within the
ministry of agriculture. Apart from government ministries and institutions, Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and donor agencies are also actively involved in
research and development as well as financing of projects and programs on climate change
adaptation and mitigation.
This report is a synthesis of a larger report based on a study undertaken by CAMCO Advisory
Services. The initial study combined review of existing literature and country case studies on
Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania. Information was collected from various governmental
departments such as agriculture and climate change coordinating departments, research
institutions, donor agencies and NGOs through open ended questionnaires and key informant
interviews. Different techniques were used to administer the questionnaires and included face-
to-face meetings, email inquiries and telephone interviews. In addition secondary information
from government documents were used.

2. Integrating climate change into national
development plans and sector strategies
In the last couple of years, efforts have been made by governments in East Africa to improve
adaptive capacity and resilience of farming communities. Several projects and policies have
been initiated independently or embedded within National Development Plans (NDPs) and/or
governmental departments. These projects and policies mainly aim at reducing the negative
effects of climate change are gaining momentum across different sectors and institutions. The
projects are widely spread in various government ministries and institutions, NGOs, civil
society and even the private sector albeit in an uncoordinated manner. Despite all these
initiatives that run into millions of dollars, coming across an inventory of the projects and
programs on climate change and agriculture is still not easy. There is need for documentation
of the current and planned initiatives to facilitate coordination, avoid duplication, and inform
future projects and sharing of lessons (both successes and failures).
2.1 National development plans
Each country in East Africa has developed a national development plan (NDP) that targets
transforming their economies from low to medium-income status, as summarized in Table 2.
Ethiopia’s  NDP is a five year Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) that has defined seven
pillar strategies, one of which is maintaining agriculture as a major source of economic
growth. Of particular interest within this pillar, is promotion of multiple cropping and better
coping strategies to manage climate variability through expansion of different irrigation
systems and effective water management practices. In Ethiopia, the agricultural sector
contributes significantly to GDP. Consequently, the government expects agriculture to meet
the  country’s  food  security  and  serve  as a key sector in transforming the economy (8.6%
average growth is expected) through adequately supplying inputs for industrial growth. To
support this, the government allocated more than 10% of its national budget to agriculture in
line with the Maputo Declaration on Agriculture and Food Security in Africa of 2003 and
managed average growth rate of 6% in line with the Comprehensive African Agriculture

In Kenya, the government unveiled a long–term development plan towards the end of 2007
that aspires to transform the country into an industrialized middle-income country by 2030 –
Kenya  Vision  2030.  Kenya’s  Vision  2030 is being implemented through a successive five
Medium Term Plans (MTP). Vision 2030 recognizes agriculture as the most important driver
of  Kenya’s  economy,  thus  prompting  the  government  to  allocate 11% of its budget to
agriculture in the 2011/12 financial year, surpassing the minimum allocation set by Maputo
Declaration of 2003. Since  Kenya’s  agricultural  sector  is  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  change
due to its low adaptive capacity, Vision 2030 proposed climate change adaptation and
mitigation options in the agriculture and forestry sector—in tandem with proposed mitigation
and adaptation interventions in the National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS).
These include supporting the establishment of crop and livestock insurance schemes;
enhancing knowledge and skills of farmers and extension staff through training and
knowledge sharing; improving seed quality and livestock productivity; better management of
water; increasing agricultural productivity through provision of widely-accessible inputs and
services to crop farmers and pastoralists; irrigation intensification and expansion to increase

5 CAADP is an agricultural programme of NEPAD and focuses on improving food security, nutrition, and increasing incomes in
Africa's largely farming based economies. It aims to do this by raising agricultural productivity by at least 6% annually and
increasing national government investment in agriculture to 10% of the annual national budget.

agricultural production; livestock development; livestock disease-free zones; disaster
preparedness; and strengthening research and development.
Uganda has the National Vision Framework (NVF) that provides plans and strategies to
transform Uganda from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country by 2040. Similar to
Kenya’s Vision 2030, NVF will be implemented in six five-year National Development Plans.
Uganda has already prepared the first one that covers fiscal period 2010/11-2014/15. Under
the NVF, the government plans to allocate an average of 5.4% of the annual budget to
agriculture, far less than the CAADP target of 10% annual budgetary allocation to agriculture.
Within The NVF, climate change has been mentioned under the agricultural sector and is
expected to affect agricultural production, food security and employment levels. NVF
advocates for building capacity to respond to climate change through various interventions
such as identifying climate effects, vulnerabilities and coping measures as they relate to
various agricultural production strategies across Uganda; improving climate forecasts along
with procedures for use in agricultural management; integrating climate risk management in
agricultural business strategies; and strengthening national and local capacity to integrate
climate change into planning processes.
Tanzania’s  NDP  popularly  known  as  ‘Vision  2025’  provides  a  national  framework  for
attaining sustainable development and natural resources management (URT 2001). Tanzania
Development Vision (TDV) 2025 has several targets and agriculture is listed under the
improved livelihoods target where food self-sufficiency and food security are the key goals.
These goals can be achieved by transforming the economy into a strong, resilient and
competitive one, and strengthened by science and technology. The strategy to be adopted is
that of transforming the economy from a predominantly agricultural one with low
productivity to a diversified and semi-industrialized economy. To achieve this vision, the
government allocated a total budget of USD 574.1 million (slightly over 8% of the total
annual budget to agriculture for the 2010/11 financial year. This reflected a 35.5% increase
from the previous financial year (2009/10) that allocated USD 423.6 million. Despite the
increase, the budget allocated to agriculture represented is still short of the 10% proposed
under the CAADP initiative.
All the countries in East Africa are working towards shaping climate change solutions. The
countries aim to respond and adapt to climate change along with efforts to reduce emissions

18
through low carbon growth pathways. All the countries in the region are formulating and
implementing climate change policies, projects and plans in line with their overall NDPs. The
next section looks at how national governments are responding to climate change in
agriculture, forestry and land use, and land use planning.
2.2 Climate change initiatives by sector
2.2.1 Agriculture
All countries have initiated various climate change actions (Table  3).  Ethiopia’s  national  GTP
is expected to pursue carbon neutral and climate resilient development and is currently in the
process of implementing a Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE). Equally, Kenya has
integrated climate change issues into Vision 2030 that proposes to develop improved water
storage infrastructure (e.g. dams) for irrigation in areas that experience extreme flooding and
arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs). Another important climate change response proposed in
2030 Vision is farmland and dry land tree planting at farm level (an agroforestry system that
intends to incorporate bee-keeping) that will contribute to a 10% forest cover nation-wide.
The Ministry of Environment and Mineral Resources (MEMR) is the main body for all
climate change issues, including agriculture. Other major actors in climate change with
directives and coordination from MEMR in relation to agriculture are:
 Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) where a Climate Change Unit (CCU) has been set up to
monitor effects of climate change and to support agricultural advisory services.
 Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) also set up a CCU in 2010 with financial
support from the Rockefeller Foundation, to mainstream climate change into the
agricultural research programmes.
Tanzania’s  Five  year  development  plan  (2011/2012-2015/16) has placed priority on climate-
smart economic policies. Agriculture is identified as one of the key areas for intervention by
focusing on the transformation from food self-sufficiency to export, development of irrigation
and high value crops.
In Uganda, the government intends to integrate climate change adaptation and mitigation and
ensure climate proof development planning in all government sectors, including agriculture.
The Ministry of Water and Environment is the national coordinating body on climate change
issues in Uganda. The ministry established a Climate Change Unit for ease of coordinating

19
activities. However,  CCU’s  coordination  capacity  is  crippled  by  lack  of  clear  defined  strategy
or national policy on climate change since it has lacked the capacity to supervise and
coordinate climate change activities across different sectors. Other research bodies,
institutions, NGOs involved in climate change issues in East Africa are summarized in
Appendix I.
2.2.2 Forestry
The forestry sector in East Africa features prominently in climate change debates, especially
its role in provision of environmental services and protection. Most of the forests are being
depleted through slash and burn for agricultural activities, thus reducing their ecosystem
functions as carbon sinks (Verchot et al. 2007). Despite this, data collected at continental level
shows that East  Africa’s  emission  of  CO2 is low, estimated at less than 0.1 metric ton of
carbon per person per year (Africa emits 3%  of  the  world’s  total  emissions  of  GHG) (IPCC
2007). All the countries in the region have recognized the importance of forestry in climate
change mitigation in their various NDPs. With a forest cover of 38% of the total land6,
Tanzania’s  development Vision (TDV) has given priority to mainstreaming future policy
measures alongside climate smart economic development policies. TDV has allocated funding
towards this effort as well as REDD initiatives and development. These activities will be
under the National Forestry Program (NFP) in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism
(MNRT). Unfortunately, climate change is not a priority for NFP. Equally, climate change is
not mentioned in the Forest Act of 2002. The NFP and the Forest Acts are under revision with
support from Finland and German Technical Cooperation (GIZ), and so it is expected the
revised policy plans will address this gap.
The Kenya Forest Service is responsible for climate change adaptation and mitigation in the
forestry sector. Kenya Forest Services’ efforts to reduce CO2 emissions include through the
REDD Readiness plan (with support from Forest Carbon Partnership-FCPF) and support to
rural communities to encourage the sustainable use of forest resources through REDD+
mechanisms.  Kenya’s  Vision  2030  has  set  specific  goals  addressing  climate  change  in  forestry
sector and includes increasing forest cover from less than 3% to 4%, applying natural resource

6 13.5 million hectares are gazetted as national forest reserves, of which 1.6 million ha are managed as catchments forests and
90,000 ha, 150,000 ha and 120,000 ha are managed by the Government, private industrial and small-scale woodlots, and
medium-sized plantations owned by smallholders, respectively. Others are managed as local authority forest reserves (600
reserves) and 200 local authority forest reserves. A total of 2.1 million ha are currently under community based forest
management and 4.2 million ha are gazetted as village forest reserves.

20
accounting in national accounts, piloting five initiatives on climate change adaptation and
desertification in ASALs, and developing natural resource database. To achieve the goals,
several strategies are outlined and include rehabilitation of degraded forest areas and
promotion of on-farm forestry (to complement the agricultural sector), securing global
payment for ecosystem services such as Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and user
compensation for environmental services.
Despite a forest cover of 24% of total land, Uganda does not explicitly target climate change
in its NDPs and the Forestry Policy of 2001. However, the government is currently in the
process of reviewing and revising the legal framework for the forestry sector to ensure, among
others, that carbon is stored through forestry. This is one of the key agreements under the
UNFCCC. In Ethiopia, the regional governments are responsible for managing forest
resources. However, Ethiopia’s GTP indirectly addresses climate change in forestry sector by
pledging to disseminate use of improved alternative energy sources that minimize
deforestation.
2.2.3 Land use and land management
Appropriate land policies are important instruments to address climate change. In East Africa,
land issues are often complex, ethnically and politically contentious. These complexities make
land policies difficult to implement. National government must therefore, play a key role in
formulating and implementing land policies that are favourable to its people, to enable them
adapt to climate change. Only Tanzania and Uganda have addressed land use policies to deal
with climate change in their NDP (Table 3).
Uganda’s  Land  Use  Policy-2011 recognizes the impact of climate change, especially in
exacerbating the already degraded, fragile natural ecosystem. Through the policy, the
government intends to address climate change mitigation and adaptation by: a) mainstreaming
sustainable management of the environment and natural resources in its plans and programs;
b) putting in place climatic change adaptation strategies to reduce impact on people and the
economy and c) developing a framework for compliance with all international climate change
commitments. These activities will be spearheaded by Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban
Development.

7 The National Climate Change Steering Committee is an inter-ministerial committee comprised of Permanent
Secretaries from 13 ministries: Energy, Finance, Industry, Natural Resources, Justice and Constitutional Affairs,
Land, Agriculture, Livestock Development, Foreign Affairs, and International Cooperation.
8 MAAIF in its ASDS and Investment Plan for 2010/11-2014/15 will establish a climate change planning facility
with a budget of about USD 8,000, with the following functions: a) identify climate impacts, vulnerabilities and
coping measures; b) improve the quality and distribution of forecasts; c) integrate climate risk management in agri-
business strategies; d) strength district capacity to integrate climate change issues into planning

22
The government of Tanzania is preparing to integrate climate change in its land
use/environmental policy that will guide mitigation and adaptation measures. Kenya has two
ministries that are linking land use policy and climate change. The MEMR has set up a
REDD, Land use and land use change division to assist different sectors of Kenya economy to
use innovative technologies that can reduce GHG emissions while sustaining economic
growth and livelihoods. The Ministry of Lands, the designated department dealing with land
use issues is in the process of formulating and implementing a National Land Use policy that
will, among other things, create a national spatial data infrastructure that will facilitate
tracking of land use patterns in the country.
2.3 Climate change action frameworks
Climate change action frameworks are roadmaps that guide the implementation of various
climate change adaptation and mitigation projects and programs. The frameworks provide a
range of options for action on climate change through a clear overview of on-going and
planned activities at the national levels, responsible government departments and sources of
funding.
Kenya has two specific climate change action frameworks, developed through a consultative
process involving stakeholders from government, private sector, NGOs, civil society
organizations, and local communities and these are the NCCRS and the ASDS (Table 4). Both
frameworks reinforce the importance of agriculture as the second largest contributor to
Kenya’s  GDP  and  acknowledge the sector’s vulnerability to climate change. NCCRS
emphasizes three major pathways: prioritizing the most vulnerable sectors of the economy for
immediate action, providing explicit measures for addressing climate change and, defining
criteria for monitoring the effectiveness of such measures (GoK 2010). NCCRS developed a
resource mobilization plan to source funds from local sources (LATIF, CDF and the private
sector), other governments, international funding agencies (e.g. World Bank and International
Monetary Fund) and development partners and regional funding agencies such as the African
Development Bank.

Apart from Kenya, all the other three countries (Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania) do not have
broad frameworks. Tanzania has the ASDS and the National Environmental Policy (1997)
that serves as the framework for implementing both the adaptation and mitigation measures in
agriculture. As previous mentioned, Uganda is in the process of developing a climate change
policy that will help to coordinate action on climate change, increase awareness and funding
of priority interventions. The Uganda CCU will initiate this policy with a legislative
framework that will adapt the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. Ethiopia’s  Agricultural
Sector Policy and Investment Framework (PIF) is a 10-year plan from 2010/11 financial year
to 2019/20. PIF is anchored in and aligned with the national vision, and provides a strategic
framework for prioritization, and planning of investments that will  drive  Ethiopia’s
agricultural growth and development.
2.3.1 Agricultural sector development strategy and policies
All the countries in East Africa have developed their ASDS as operational strategies within
the NDPs (Table 5). Kenya’s  ASDS  was  launched in 2004 and targets an annual growth rate
of 7%. However, since growth in the sector depends on favourable climatic conditions, ASDS
has incorporated efforts to support the NCCRS and Vision 2030.

Tanzania’s  ASDS targets a 5% annual growth through transformation from subsistence to
commercial agriculture mainly by the private sector, facilitated through public-private
partnerships with participatory implementation of the District Agricultural Development
Plans. The ASDS provides the government with a sector-wide framework for overseeing
expenditure and investment in the  agricultural  sector.  Uganda’s  ASDS  was  formulated  in  the
context of an assessment of the effects of climate related risks on agricultural development.
Ethiopia’s  10-year Sector Policy and Investment Framework focuses on planning of
investments to enable the country achieve sustainable agricultural growth and development.
The formulation of the framework was overseen by the PIF steering committee and its being
implemented within the MoARD.
2.3.2 Low carbon development plans
Unsustainable use of natural resources and the increasing reliance and inefficient use of fossil
fuels threatens economic growth and development in East Africa. A sustainable pathway
needs to be adopted to ensure that each country is developing whilst protecting its natural
resource base and environment. Unfortunately, Kenya is the only country in the region with a

25
low carbon plan in place9. A sub-component of the Kenya NCCRS is the development of
Long-term National Low Carbon Development Pathway that will identify important elements
to guide the country towards a low-carbon and climate resilient growth. The pathway will be
used as a baseline to identify climate change impacts and identify GHG mitigation
opportunities.
The other three countries have not fully developed their low carbon development plans. For
instance, Uganda’s  NDP intends to promote a low carbon economic development pathway
through provision and promotion of incentives for clean development with the following
interventions:

Intensify public education on the role of emissions in global warming;

Develop and implement incentive mechanism for reduced or avoided emissions;

Build capacity of private sector to effectively participate in clean energy development
initiatives;

Reduce overheads for CDM project formulation and development.
Tanzania and Ethiopia have draft low carbon plans. Ethiopia is in the process of developing a
strategy towards low carbon development pathway — the CRGE, that addresses mitigation
and adaptation across many sectors of the economy. Within the CRGE, thematic areas related
to agriculture include livestock, soil-based emissions and REDD.

9 Kenya is already a low carbon economy with a per capita emission of 1.2 tCO2 compared  to  the  world’s  average  of  7  tCO2 (WRI
2011). However, this is expected to increase as the country gears towards attaining an average annual economic growth rate of
10% by 2030. Total GHG emissions currently estimated at 42 million tCO2e are also expected to increase to 90 million tCO2e
due to an expanding economy and a rapidly increasing population (GoK 2007, SEI 2009).

26
3. National climate change policies
To effectively address climate change in East Africa, adaptation and mitigation strategies are
necessary at several levels simultaneously, that is local to national level, involving private and
public sectors. For these efforts to succeed, they must be guided and supported by national
policies and strategies. What policies do countries in the region have in place to support their
efforts for climate change adaptation and mitigation? To support East Africa countries
formulate policies, UNFCCC advocates for building capacity to assess climate vulnerability
and identification of adaptation needs and options such as supporting the development of
comprehensive national adaptation strategies (Klein et al. 2007). Despite UNFCCC
assistance, all the countries have faced challenges in developing and implementing sector
specific policies incorporating climate change. The challenges include lack of technical
capacity, finance and infrastructure limitations.
While there is no direct policy dealing with climate change across the East Africa countries,
each country has set out guidelines and frameworks for addressing climate change. Kenya has
developed a NCCRS that provides a roadmap for climate change adaptation across the
different sectors of the economy, and the development of a policy is in the pipeline. Currently,
the NCCRS serves as a policy guideline on climate change and focuses on ensuring
integration of adaptation and mitigation measures in all government planning and
development initiatives (Nzuma 2013). As stated earlier, policy formulation is on-going in the
agricultural sector (e.g. the ASDS) through participatory processes involving relevant
stakeholders from development partners and government ministries. Already, a National
Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) that will implement the NCCRS is in place and will
be revised every 5 years in line with Vision 2030 (GoK 2013).
Mitigation policies have not yet been developed in all countries in East Africa. Kenya does
not have direct policies on climate change mitigation, but there are two policies that address
climate change. These are the draft National Environmental Policy of 2008 (MEMR), and the
National Land Policy (Ministry of Lands) that guides the country towards a sustainable and
equitable use of land. The policy states that it will  ‘encourage a multi-sectoral approach to
land use, provide social, economic and other incentives and put in place an enabling

27
environment  for  agriculture  and  livestock  development’. The policy also aims to involve all
stakeholders, especially local communities in forestry management.
In Tanzania, the National Environmental Policy (NEP) was formulated to provide a
framework for mainstreaming environmental considerations into decision-making processes.
Though NEP does not explicitly address climate change, it highlights the importance of
integrating environmental management in several government departments such as energy
and agriculture. Another policy Tanzania that does not give direct reference to climate change
but is important is the National Forestry Policy (NFP). This policy aims to engage
government, local communities and other stakeholders in joint management of forests.
Due to the cross-sectoral nature of climate change impacts in Uganda, two strategic
committees were formed. These are the Climate Change Policy Committee comprising of 14
members to provide policy guidance on climate change and the Inter-institutional Climate
Change Technical committee that is mandated to bridge the gap between Uganda’s CCU and
other institutions and facilitate exchange of information. To date, the committee has not
proposed a policy yet. Uganda is thus relying on Acts and Regulations that indirectly address
climate change issues. For instance, NEMA-Uganda developed a working paper on natural
resources, environment and climate change.
Ethiopia has a number of policies on land-use planning (e.g. Plan for Accelerated and
Sustained Development to End Poverty) that indirectly have an impact on climate change in
the agricultural sector. Improved land tenure security is seen as a vital component of
sustainable land use and land-use planning in Ethiopia and has led to successful land reforms.
3.1 National communications to UNFCCC
All the four countries in East Africa are parties to the UNFCCC and Kyoto protocol.
UNFCCC requires countries to communicate to the Conference of Parties information
regarding human induced emissions by source and removal by sinks of greenhouse gases,
technological and policy options for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and assessment
of vulnerability and adaptation of climate change. Ethiopia was the first country to submit its
communication to UNFCCC in 2001, followed by Kenya and Uganda (2002) and Tanzania in
2003 (Table 6). Tanzania and Uganda documents were circulated amongst various
stakeholders through workshops for their inputs. Tanzania’s  first  document  presented  clear

28
suggestions on adaptation and mitigation policies and measure in the agricultural sector. To
estimate GHG emissions, all the countries except Tanzania used Tier-I methodology.
Tanzania used Tier-II. Inventory was created for both direct GHGs such as Carbon Dioxide
(CO2), Methane (CH4), and Nitrous Oxide (N2O), and indirect GHGs such as Nitrogen Oxides
(NO) and Carbon Monoxide (CO).
Most of the communication to UNFCCC cited limitations in acquiring emission statistics.
Kenya, for example, reported unavailability of the data particularly on trends and rates of land
use change, emissions from the soil were not calculated due to inadequate data and high
variability of soil carbon content, lack of information on newly introduced industrial
processes and, land use and forest data published in literature emphasizes scientific and not
traditional use of forests.

Ethiopia and Tanzania have both completed the second communication but have not
submitted to UNFCCC. For Kenya, preparation of the second communication was started in
2009, however, its current status is not clear. Uganda has also drafted its second
communication, but finalization has been delayed due to lack of funds and a slow bureaucratic
procurement process. It is expected to be ready by early 2014.

29
3.2 National adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs)
The national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) are guidelines for Least Developed
Countries (LDCs) to identify priority activities that respond to their urgent and immediate
needs to adapt to climate change — those for which further delay would increase
vulnerability. Each eligible country relied on a large team of multi-disciplinary experts to
draft the NAPAs and submitted to UNFCCC by or before 2008. Kenya is a Less
Economically Developed Country (LECD) and therefore does not qualify for Global
Environment Facility (GEF) funds to develop its NAP. Uganda and Tanzania used
participatory approaches to gather information from local levels to be incorporated into the
NAPA. A total of six projects in Tanzania, eleven in Ethiopia and nine in Uganda were
developed under NAPA and were funded through the GEF-Least Developed Countries Fund.
These projects range from food security, risk management, human health, carbon
sequestration and institutional development (capacity building and infrastructure) and are
being implemented in various ecological zones (forests, rangelands, highlands and wetlands).
Progress on the Uganda projects10 has been limited due to lack of funds, inadequate capacity
to prepare detailed proposals and mobilizing additional funds from donor agencies.
Implementation of NAPA projects in Ethiopia has not started mainly due to absence of strong
coordination mechanisms at the federal and regional level, lack of financial and institutional
capacity (particularly the lack of an institution for research on climate change adaptation),
lack of efficient outreach mechanism to local communities, and difficulty of mainstreaming
climate change adaptation into development process. Since Kenya does not qualify for GEF
funding to develop its NAPA, the government through the MEMR developed the NCCRS.
The NCCAP, which is a follow-up plan for implementing NCCRS, has eight sub-components.
The third sub-component of the NCCAP is to develop a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to
identify priority immediate, medium and long-term adaptation actions. NAPs are successors

10 Uganda’s  projects  include Land Degradation Management Project (US$ 4.7M); Strengthening Meteorological Services (US$
6.5 M); Community Water and Sanitation Project (US$ 4.7M); Water for Production Project (US$ 5 M); Drought Adaptation
Project (US$ 3M); Community Tree Growing Project (US$ 5.5M); Climate Change and Development Planning Project (US$
1.2M); Indigenous Knowledge (IK) and Natural Resources Management (US$ 1.2M); and Vectors, Pests and Disease Control
Project (US$ 8M)

30
of NAPAs and enable all developing countries to assess their vulnerabilities, mainstream
climate change risks and address adaptation needs.
3.3 Nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs)
The national appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) are a set of policies and priority actions
that countries undertake as part of a voluntary commitment to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions (UNFCCC 2007). Ethiopia was the first country in East Africa to prepare and
submit a NAMA to UNFCCC in 2010. The Ethiopian NAMA covered most sectors of the
economy including agriculture, electricity generation from renewable energy, transport,
biofuel, forestry and waste management. Specific priority actions for agriculture included
increasing use of compost rural communities to increase carbon retention and implementation
of agro-forestry practices to improve livelihoods and also for carbon sequestration. In the
forestry sector, specific actions included district-level reforestation, sustainable forest and
wetland management, and establishment of plantation forests.
In Uganda’s  draft  NAMA  funded  by  the African Development Bank (AfDB), specific
mitigation priority actions directly linked to agriculture include promoting mulching,
recycling of crop residues and zero burning practice, promoting cultivation of high-yielding
upland rice, enforcing legislation and regulation on wetland and forest demarcation and
reclamation where necessary, promoting use of organic fertilizers, promoting integrated
agricultural zoning, and land-use planning.
Kenya has put in place a process for developing its NAMA to be implemented in the context
of  the  country’s  wider  sustainable  development  strategy,  and  with  the  aim  of  moving  the
economy towards a low-carbon  pathway.  Kenya’s  projections  of  GHG  emission  to  2030
shows that agriculture and forestry sectors (particularly livestock and deforestation) are and
will be the largest emitters accounting for about 72% of emission in 2010 and 65% in 2030
(GoK 2013). Climate smart agricultural technologies and practices are among the proposed
interventions — agroforestry, conservation tillage and limiting the use of fire in range and
crop management, manure management through biogas promotion and pasture rehabilitation,
management and conservation.
In Tanzania, NAMAs priority interventions proposed in the NAMA for the agricultural sector
include promoting agroforestry, enhancing management of agricultural waste, promoting

31
manure management practices, promoting efficient fertilizer use, promoting appropriate
technology for producing animal feed, promoting waste management in abattoir and
improving rangelands productivity and complementary activities. Among the NAMA
initiatives being implemented in Tanzania is a programme on Low Emission Capacity
Building by UNDP (funded by the European Union).  This programme promotes cooperation
between relevant institutions, while at the same time engaging the public sector in a concerted
effort to address climate change consistent with national development priorities. Activities in
this program include Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS), Monitoring, Reporting
and Verification (MRV) procedures and sampling and GHG inventory management systems.
Other initiatives that have been completed include inventory of GHG emissions and
identification of technological and other mitigation, preparation of the national CDM
investor’s  guide among others.
3.4 Integrating REDD+ initiatives in agriculture
The potential for mitigation through agriculture in Africa has been estimated at 970mtCO2 per
year by 2030 – accounting for 17% of the global total with an additional 14% from forestry
(UNFCCC 2008). Therefore, Africa has significant potential to deliver on carbon
sequestration and co-benefits such as food security and forest and biodiversity conservation
(Albrecht and Kadji 2003). In East Africa, GHG emissions from agriculture and other land
uses are expected to increase in the future due to increasing demand for agricultural products
(resulting from increasing population) and changing food preferences (Thornton et al. 2009,
Thornton and Herrero 2010). Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation
(REDD) is a set of steps designed by the UN to use market and financial incentives in order
for countries to reduce GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. REDD+ is
an improvement on REDD and encompasses not only deforestation and forest degradation,
but incorporates conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest
carbon stocks as well.
In the first communication to UNFCCC, all countries in East Africa except Tanzania
acknowledge the agricultural sector is the major contributor to GHG, accounting for about
14% of GHG emissions. Tanzania reported a 5.7% contribution of GHG from agriculture.
Information emerging from East Africa regarding status of REDD+ indicates that preparation
of the document was through stakeholder participation. Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are

32
members of REDD+ partnership — a forum launched in May 2010 and open to all countries
willing to support or undertake REDD+ actions. REDD+ maintains a database for all the
countries. Kenya and Tanzania have not directly received any funding for REDD+ related
activities although the database indicate that the two countries have received funding from
other sources for REDD+ activities. Ethiopia and Uganda have received funding for REDD+
activities, though Uganda has also received funding from other sources (Table 7).

All countries have developed their Readiness Plan Idea Note (R-PIN) for development of the
REDD+ strategy (Table 7). The R-PIN identifies various drivers of deforestation. Agriculture

33
is a major driver of deforestation across all the four countries. In addition to preparing the
Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP), Uganda is the first country in Africa to undertake a
reforestation project that will help reduce emissions under the Kyoto Protocol (Table 7). The
Nile Basin Reforestation Clean Development Mechanism Project is one of the eight
reforestation projects world-wide registered under the CDM. Other related projects include
the 10,000 ha of forest plantation established under the Sawlog Production Grant Scheme
(SPGS) between 2003 and 2008 (Uganda ASDS 2010). Other drivers of deforestation include
human settlement, unsustainable charcoal production, insecure land tenure arrangements,
overgrazing, forest fires, selective removal of favoured timber trees, institutional failures
arising from weak governance structures, inadequate capacity to enforce the law, inadequate
forest management plans, lack of community participation in forest management, and poverty.
In Tanzania, additional drivers of deforestation include refugees, infrastructure, industry and
introduction of large-scale agriculture for bio-fuel.
Under  Ethiopia’s  GTP,  the  government  plans  to  develop  plantation  farms  that will further
increase deforestation. The current rate of deforestation in Ethiopia estimated at 200,000
ha/year. For small-scale farmers, GTP aims to enhance their capacities and promote market
oriented agricultural production, thus pushing smallholders to clear forest land. Demand for
agricultural land in Ethiopia is expected to increase from 15 million ha in 2008 to 19 million
ha by 2030 due to annual population growth of 2-3% and government initiatives to expand
agricultural production (Zeleke 2010). These activities and initiatives will lead to increase in
GHG emissions.
Kenya and Tanzania REDD+ strategy are in line with the Kissinger Report (Kissinger 2011).
Following recommendations from NCCRS that pledges to support REDD+ initiative, Kenya
revised its R-PP taking into account the linkages between agriculture and REDD+ and re-
submitted to UNFCCC in 2010. In this respect, the proposed REDD+ strategies are designed
to complement other related policies and strategies such as the Strategy for Revitalizing
Agriculture (SRA), Vision 2030, the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act
(EMCA) of 1999, Energy Policy, Water Policy, and the Policy on Arid and Semi-Arid Lands.
Kenya has already started implementing its R-PP activities (Table 7).
Tanzania’s  REDD+  strategy  focuses on nine specific options in agriculture intended to
facilitate streamlining of REDD+ implementation into the broader NDPs. The implementation

34
options include improvements in policies and regulations management and utilization, natural
resources management practices and improved technical skills at the national and sub-national
levels for various stakeholders involved in the REDD implementation process, strategic
linkages and synergies between forestry and other sectors such as agriculture, energy, mining,
infrastructure and livestock. Evidence documenting case studies of REDD in Tanzania and
Uganda among other countries concludes that although there are many opportunities for
REDD+, there is need to overcome legal, policy, and institutional hurdles first, as well as
undertake capacity development (Richards 2010). In spite of these hurdles, a number of
REDD+ pilots are currently on-going in Tanzania. With the exception of Kenya, Tanzania is
relatively ahead of its counterparts in the region in implementing REDD+ activities. The UN-
REDD programme in Tanzania, for example, is assisting the government with the
establishment of a national forest carbon (MRV)11 as well as achieving REDD-Readiness. In
addition, a national carbon monitoring centre to will be established and hosted by Sokoine
University of Agriculture with funding from the Royal Norwegian Embassy.

11 Countries are required to quantify their achievements in REDD+ through use Measurement, Reporting and Verification system.
MRV provides an account for the amount of forest carbon and changes over time.

4. Other climate change issues in East Africa
4.1 Priorities for investment in agricultural development and
intensification in the next 5 years
Economies in East Africa mainly depend on agriculture, with low productivity. The aim of the
countries in the region is to transform to diversified, high agricultural productivity and semi-
industrialized economies that will generate high incomes and ensure food security. Sustained
growth in agriculture calls for investment in agricultural sector at all levels, from local to
national level. All countries have outlined priority areas for investment in agricultural
development and intensification in their national development strategy focusing on food
security, private sector and policy development.
4.1.1 Improving food security
Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda have outlined their priority areas in the ASDS. In addition,
Kenya has outlined its priorities in Vision 2030. Specifically, Tanzania intends to focus on
irrigation and water management, range management, livestock development and animal
health, better land husbandry, crop production and protection, mechanization, storage and
post-harvest improvement, and agro-processing. In Kenya, the ASDS and Vision 2030 intend
to focus on irrigation, biofuels, forest conservation, local carbon development and restoration
of degraded lands (Appendix II).
Uganda’s  priority  in  the  ASDS  is  climate  change  policy,  specifically  focusing  on
reforestation, food security, irrigation, soil protection, natural resource management and
strengthening meteorological services (Development Strategy and Investment Plan 2011,
Hepworth 2010). Uganda NAPA and DSIP (2011-2015) have defined priorities for
investment in agriculture and only DSIP has allocated fund for the priorities. The priorities
include enhancing agricultural production and productivity, improving access to markets and
value addition, creating enabling environment, institutional strengthening, improved
management of crop pests and diseases, agricultural advisory services, agricultural technology
development and regulatory services (Appendix II).

36
Ethiopia has outlined its priorities in the GTP, focusing on smallholder agriculture and
pastoral systems. Three areas have been identified for smallholder agriculture and include
scaling up best practices12, expanding irrigation development and improving natural resource
conservation, and production of high value crops. Priorities for pastoral systems will focus on
water development for people and livestock — diversion of river waters, drilling of boreholes
and development of irrigation schemes. In addition, the government intends to improve and
expand livestock marketing system, improve pastures, strengthen animal transportation and
market price information systems, strengthen pastoralist extension system and research
centres to address the technological needs of pastoralists. The government also plans to
voluntarily settle the pastoralists.
4.1.2 Private sector development
Kenya had developed a Private Sector Development Strategy (PSDS-2006-2010) that
identified agriculture, industry and services sectors as the three broad areas of investment.
While the PSDS does not propose specific financial interventions for climate change
adaptation and mitigation for agriculture, the strategy proposes it will complement the actions
outlined in the Strategy for Revitalizing Agriculture, to support the growth of the agricultural
sector. To enhance agricultural productivity and profitability, the Tanzania government will
facilitate public-private sector partnership with clearly defined roles. This will be achieved by
addressing the constraints to private sector involvement, including market development and
infrastructure, increased vertical integration through contract farming, advocating for
producer organizations, and supporting financial institutions and services.
In Ethiopia, private sector involvement is driven by the recent success in the floriculture
industry. The government plans to address the problems of marketing, infrastructure (logistics
and transport) to boost production and exports. Through the GTP, the government intends to
expand greenhouse technology and large scale farming into lowland areas, develop irrigation
and establish out-growers scheme where farmers have formed associations to assist them

12 The aim is to strengthen capacities of farmers, agricultural extension officers and development agents through effective
utilization of existing technologies and adoption of new technologies that will improve soil fertility (e.g. increasing fertilizer
application from 0.04t/ha to 0.25t/ha by 2030, build a fertilizer factory by 2014 and promote use of organic fertilizers to reduce
the levels of GHG emissions).

37
export their horticultural produce. In Uganda, the only private sector involved in climate
change issues, though not directly related to agriculture is the Mukwano Industries Limited
that invests in tree planting activities among smallholder farmers through its corporate
responsibility initiative.
4.1.3 Policy development
All countries across East Africa are committed to creating a favourable legal, regulatory and
enabling policy environment for investment in agriculture. In Tanzania, this is expected to
facilitate stronger participation of the private sector in agriculture, specifically in development
and production of quality seeds.13 In Ethiopia, the government plans to establish an effective
land administration system and implementing agency that would ensure transparent and
accountable land leasing and land use practices. In Vision 2030 and ASDS (2010-2020),
Kenya has outlined two policies — the fertilizer and national horticultural policy-2010 - to
attract investments in agriculture. The fertilizer policy will be implemented through the
Fertilizer Cost-reduction Investment Project14, whereby the raw materials will be sourced
from the neighbouring countries of Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania. In the horticultural policy,
priorities for investment include capital investment and value addition, partnerships with
financial institutions through public-private initiatives, development of appropriate credit
packages for seed, fertilizers and pesticides, and development of irrigation schemes.
There are other cross-cutting investment options that the East African countries are targeting
to include other sectors of the economy. For example, the governments recognize that linking
agriculture and other sectors like rural infrastructure and energy, civil service reform,
implementation of land Acts, health (HIV/AIDS, malaria), gender, education, environmental
management, forestry and fisheries, and water related sectors is critical in tackling climate
change within the agricultural sector.

13 Tanzania heavily relies on imported seeds. In 2009, Tanzania imported 75% of its seed from USA.
14 Kenya’s  MoA commissioned a feasibility study in June 2011 to establish a manufacturing plant in Kenya as a flagship project
of Vision 2030.

4.2 Financing for climate change adaptation and mitigation in
agriculture
Adapting to climate change, coping with climate variability and reducing GHG emissions
requires finance, technology transfer, and capacity building. In order for agriculture to
continue providing solutions to climate change and to guarantee food security and
development, the three components have to be integrated. Apart from Kenya that sources for
funds locally as well, all the other three countries in the region heavily rely on donor agencies,
bilateral and multilateral parties and international NGOs to finance climate change mitigation
and adaptation initiatives, programs and projects (Appendix III). Projects in Ethiopia and
Kenya focus both on mitigation and adaptation in agriculture, while projects in Tanzania and
Uganda focus on mitigation (Table 8).

All the countries are calling for investment in capacity building. Uganda is already investing
heavily in building capacity of the research organizations. The UN and the government of
Uganda, for example, have jointly initiated a project - LEARN for the period 2010-2014. The
project aims to foster a systematic and country-driven process to strengthen human resources
and skills to advance a green, low emission and climate resilient development. Through the
project, a national strategy to strengthen human resources and skills to advance green, low
emission and climate resilient development has been developed.
In Ethiopia, projects focus on adaptation in agriculture, specifically use of disease resistant
crops, use of seasonal climate forecast and development of weather based insurance. In
addition,  Ethiopia’s  CRGE  has  highlighted  seven  thematic  areas  of which agriculture is a
priority for promoting low carbon development growth and resilient economy. The above
projects are mainly undertaken by government ministries, NGOs at the grassroots level and
research organizations. EIAR, for example, is currently undertaking research projects that aim
to reduce crops/soil based and livestock GHG emissions.
Future projects in Ethiopia are aimed at reducing the emissions from the soil/crop cultivation,
livestock and enhancing of carbon uptake through tree planting and improved cultivation
practices. In particular during implementation of CRGE, focus will be on the livestock sector.
Ethiopia’s  Environment Protection Authority (EPA) also drafted a Program of Adaptation to
Climate Change (EPACC). The objective of the program is to create a foundation for a
carbon-neutral and climate-resilient path towards sustainable development. Through extensive
stakeholder consultations, each region prepared their own adaptation plans based on
immediate and anticipated climate change threats. Threats identified include human, animal
and crop diseases; land degradation; loss of biodiversity; decline in agricultural production;
dwindling water supply; and social inequality.
Kenya seeks funds for climate change programs and projects from national and international
sources.  Kenya’s  NCCRS  developed  a  resource mobilization plan that ensures finance is
available from local and national government (LATIF and CDF), climate change funds, the
private sector, World Bank and International Monetary Fund and other development partners
(Table 8). Programmes and projects identified in the strategy will be implemented over the
next 20 years at an average cost of USD 3.14 billion annually. The annual cost estimates for
agriculture is USD 132.5 million, and water and irrigation USD 74.5 million. Kenya’s  ASDS

40
2010–2020 framework has equally proposed ways of financing programmes and projects to
be shared among government, development partners and the private sector. The strategy
proposed the establishment of Innovation Fund for Agriculture and Agribusiness (IFAA). The
objective  of  the  IFAA  will  be  to  foster  ASDS’s  central  objective  of  commercializing
agriculture by catalysing private sector participation in market-oriented production and
service delivery, promoting productivity and profitability or commercial viability of sector
activities at all levels.
Several international donors are financing climate change projects, initiatives and programs in
East Africa. While some of the donors target specific projects, sectors or regions of the
country, others are cross-cutting and include several sectors. Climate change adaptation and
mitigation projects supported include crop and livestock projects, development and
implementation of low carbon strategies, sustainable land management, capacity building and
investment in infrastructures (such as irrigation schemes) and markets. The international
donors include DANIDA, USAID, SIDA, DFID (the largest bilateral donor), JICA, IFAD,
IDRC, World Bank-IFC, Canada Cooperation Office, European Commission and Africare.
UN agencies are UNDP, UNEP, FAO, Oxfam-GB, World Food Program and private
foundations (e.g. Rockefeller Foundation). Various organizations and associations within East
Africa are also funding climate change initiatives. Some of these are Association for
Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA), CAADP,
Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), and Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) (Appendix IV).
4.3 Linkages between adaptation and mitigation in agriculture
Mitigation and adaptation has been treated as separate entities within the UNFCCC
negotiation process, with adaptation largely ignored in favour of mitigation (Verchot et al.
2007, Ayers and Huq 2008). This created an imbalance in addressing the two strategies, yet
both are important in addressing climate change (Ayers and Huq 2008). Mitigation was
treated as a priority issue for developed countries with the greatest responsibility for climate
change, while adaptation was seen as a priority for developing countries, where mitigation
capacity is low and vulnerability is high (Ayers and Huq 2008). It is only recently that
adaptation measures were given more importance in the UNFCCC negotiations. For the first

41
time, IPCC Fourth Assessment Report introduced a chapter dedicated to the interrelationships
between adaptation and mitigation (IPCC 2007).
In East Africa, the linkages between adaptation and mitigation projects or activities have not
been clearly delineated. However, there is growing recognition of the dual benefits from
certain climate change projects and strategies.  Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, for instance,
have initiated projects that link adaptation and mitigation (Table 9). The promotion of use of
compost manure in increasing agricultural productivity instead of chemical fertilizers is one
example where mitigation and adaptation are combined in one practice (Table 9). In Ethiopia,
the CRGE intends to boost the synergies between adaptation and mitigation.
Despite the formation of the CCU in Uganda, mainstreaming climate change into programmes
and projects and linking the various actors remains a challenge. There is disjointed
coordination among the line ministries and even within Ministry of Water and Environment
where the CCU is located. The budgetary allocation between Water and Sanitation, and
Natural Resource sub-sectors which accommodates weather, climate and climate change
needs to be harmonized. Moreover, the CCU also has no supervisory mandate to coordinate
climate change activities in other ministries. The absence of a climate change policy and
strategy in Uganda further compounds the coordination problem.
In Tanzania, many adaptation and mitigation activities are part of sector plans, and are
coordinated within specific ministries. Mechanisms are currently in place to ensure
coordination and cooperation between the Tanzania government and development partners
with regard to activities at the local, sector, and national levels. Accordingly, the main
challenge in Tanzania is to consider how existing organizations and institutions can be
reinforced to meet the increasing challenges of climate change and variability.

4.4 Capacity development for climate change adaptation and
mitigation
In order for developing countries to implement climate change strategies and establish
effective institutions and systems, there is need to strengthen human capacity. This is reflected
in the objectives of the Cancun Agreement at COP16 in Mexico on capacity building that
stressed the need to speed up country plans to adopt sustainable paths to low emission
economies as well as cope with the negative impacts of climate change. In 2004, 32
Universities in Eastern, Central and Southern Africa, formed a regional consortium—
Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM). RUFORUM
aims to play a key role in contributing to the well-being of small-scale farmers and economic
development of countries throughout the sub-Saharan Africa region, including addressing the
emerging challenge of climate change. RUFORUM has strengthened the capacity of African
universities to provide rigorous and relevant training in agriculture to new generations of
scientists. Of the 32 universities participating in RUFORUM, 10 are from East Africa.15
Among the climate change related degrees that members of the consortium benefit from
include Masters and Doctoral degrees from the Institute for Climate Change and Adaptation
(ICCA) at the University of Nairobi. ICCA provides formal training on climate change and
adaptation; professional short courses on climate change and adaptation for public and private
sectors including NGOs; climate change and adaptation research and knowledge exchange;
action-oriented community outreach programmes for implementation of appropriate
adaptation options; and policy advice on climate change and adaptation. In Uganda, Makerere
University is integrating climate change topics into the curriculum to equip the students with
relevant knowledge and skills in climate change and agriculture.
Other universities that are not members of RUFORUM such as University of Dar es Salaam
(Institute of Resource Assessment) and Ardhi University in Tanzania have shown
commendable efforts in trying to build capacity in the field of climate change and disaster
management. University of Dar es Salaam is among the first institutions in East Africa to
mainstream climate courses into its curriculum. Currently, the university offers a course on

15 Egerton, Kenyatta, Nairobi, Moi and Jomo Kenyatta Universities in Kenya; Gulu, Kyambogo, Makerere and Uganda Martyrs
Universities in Uganda; Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania; and Haramaya and Makelle Universities in Ethiopia.

44
“Strengthening  Capacity  of  Agriculture  Sector  to  Adapt  to  Climate  Change  Impacts  in
Africa”. In Ethiopia, Arba Minch University started an MSc program on climate change and
development, Addis Ababa University established a Climate Change Research Group
(CCRG) within the Faculty of Science, while the Ethiopian Development Research Institute
focuses on adaptation and impacts of climate change on the Ethiopian agriculture.
All the East Africa countries have identified and proposed urgent areas for capacity
strengthening:

Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and strengthening institutions
particularly for academic, policymakers and researchers;

Incorporating climate change science into disciplines such as fisheries and agriculture;

Capacity building in monitoring, reporting and verification in climate change adaptation
and mitigation;

Training in technology transfer of climate smart technologies to various actors including
farmers, extension officers using different mediums;

Capacity building on how to train extension agents to implement early warning systems in
their operations;

Capacity building in financing for climate change mitigation;

Development of spatial-data infrastructure, GIS and web-based delivery systems for
national forest monitoring and carbon reporting/MRV; and

Acquisition, processing and use of remotely sensed data for effective national REDD
monitoring.
Various donors are supporting the capacity building initiatives for climate change adaptation
and Mitigation. UNDP/GEF supported the first capacity building project to strengthen the
technical and institutional capacity in the four countries to effectively respond to their
obligations under the UNFCCC. While the project was planned for 2 years (1996-1998), it did
not meet all its objectives due to implementation difficulties and short time allocated. In the
end, the project was implemented for 5 months instead of 2 years.

45
In Uganda, Rockefeller Foundation is supporting a project  to  strengthen  NARO’s  capacity  to
develop and adopt climate change adaptation interventions and policy recommendations. In
its NDP 2011-2015, the Ugandan government has planned to develop national capacity for
coordination and implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. The
ASDS  and Investment Plan (DSIP 2010/11- 2014-15) of Uganda has a budget of USD 19.35
million allocated for capacity building in MAAIF sub-programmes, and USD 13.355 million
for capacity building in climate change at the district level. This will support social welfare
and national development, and also the Uganda CCU as an institution that needs urgent
capacity building. These initiatives are being supported by the UN Joint Programme on
climate change through the UNDAF. A key feature of adaptation interventions is that they
will build on on-going Disaster Risk Reduction work.
In Tanzania, the government has established three institutes with a mandate of providing
scientific information and advice to government on matters relating to the sustainable
management of natural resources: Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI), Tanzania
Forestry Research Institute (TAFORI), and Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI).
4.5 Research priorities on adaptation and mitigation in agriculture
Evidence shows that agriculture especially livestock is a major source of GHG (Herrero and
Thorton 2009, Herrero et al. 2008, Verchot et al. 2008, Palm et al. 2010). Governments in
East Africa have identified agricultural research and development as a priority to address
climate change. In Ethiopia, the CRGE strategy proposes USD 11 million budget annually for
agricultural research to be coordinated by EIAR, indicating the importance placed on the
agriculture-climate change nexus. The government has also created a Climate Change Unit
(CCU) in the Ministry of Agriculture. The CCU will coordinate and implement projects and
policies related to agriculture and climate change, working with EIAR. The research focuses
on developing crop varieties and livestock breeds that can withstand increased temperatures,
using seasonal climate forecast, reducing GHG emissions through sustainable land
management strategies, value chain efficiency, mechanization and, rangeland and pastureland
management.
The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) launched the CCU through a grant from
the Rockefeller Foundation to serve as a focal point for climate change related research. The

46
overall goal of the KARI CCU is to mainstream climate change into the agricultural research
programmes. Specific objectives of CCU are:

To develop a climate change focal point in KARI in order to increase opportunities for
collaborative work and develop capacity of researchers to understand and develop
adaptation technologies and techniques;

Increase awareness of climate change issues and concerns internally and externally in
order to contribute to and facilitate knowledge development and information sharing;

Coordinate and direct funding for climate change adaptation research in order to
mainstream climate change efforts across KARI research stations countrywide; and

Engage external partners and stakeholders on climate change issues.
KARI’s  CCU  has  not  yet  prioritized  specific  research  areas  that  address  climate  change
However, some preliminary activities documenting all adaptation and mitigation projects
across the 36 KARI Centres have already begun. A process of developing a climate change
strategy for KARI has also been initiated and this will be a valuable document in guiding
climate change activities and sourcing for funds for implementing proposed interventions.
The MoA also has a CCU, independent of KARI’s  CCU. The two CCUs sometimes cooperate
especially in areas such as capacity building in climate change.
In Uganda, research priorities on agricultural adaptation and mitigation have not yet clearly
been defined in government plans or institutions. As previously discussed, the need to tackle
the effect of climate change on agriculture is mentioned in the NDP and DSIP. Tanzania’s
National Agricultural and Livestock Research Master Plan (1992) set priorities for research
on crops and livestock. The plan privatized or devolved to semi-public commodity boards
research on traditional crops (tea, coffee, tobacco, cashew, cotton, and sugar) with a
significant amount of financial and administrative autonomy. However, due to the importance
of smallholder agriculture, the government maintained research responsibility for food and
livestock sub-sectors. In addition, the Tanzania Agriculture and Food Security Investment
Plan (TAFSIP 2011/12 to 2020/21) proposes a number of instruments that need to be
considered for adaption to climate change: research on new crops or varieties and farming
systems suited to hotter or drier conditions, improved short and long-term weather
forecasting, and risk management measures to cope with increasing climatic variability. With

47
regard to mitigation, carbon sequestration through conservation agriculture and reforestation
are highlighted by the TAFSIP.
Across the region, there is an imbalance in addressing adaptation and mitigation, with more
projects focusing on adaptation compared to mitigation. There is need for a balance in
addressing adaptation and mitigation in agriculture through financial, technical and capacity
building support. For example, the CCUs in MoA and KARI in Kenya should map and create
a database for all climate change related activities. Similarly, all the other countries in the
region need to develop their own databases as well as establish a climate change plan that
would prioritize interventions and also for the purposes of leveraging funds for these
interventions. As noted previously, climate change data and documentation is lacking in all
countries in the region. Documentation of donors and financing sources is equally poor,
making it difficult to assess the state of climate change financing. While Tanzania has made
an effort in setting up an inventory of climate change activities, an up to date inventory of
projects and financing sources is still necessary to help identify the strengths, gaps and
opportunities.
Some of the proposed activities to complement existing climate change adaptation and
mitigation projects and programs in East Africa countries include:

Providing linkages and balance between adaptation and mitigation projects by setting up a
functional structure for coordinating all climate change initiatives in each country and the
region;

Creating a platform for exchanging information amongst researchers, policy makers and
farmers. A survey on appropriate information dissemination channels that meets the needs
of the different audiences needs to be carried out.

Identifying research and policy gaps in climate change adaptation and mitigation in
agriculture; and

A survey on the relative importance given to climate change adaptation and mitigation in
agriculture to ensure that projects developed create a win-win situation where the
emissions are reduced and farmer’s adaptive capacity is increased.

4.6.1 International and national organizations
Apart from government institutions and departments, various international and national NGOs
in East Africa have vested interest in dealing with climate change adaptation and mitigation.
The activities of these organizations include research, development, capacity building (for
farmers, scientists, students and policy makers), dissemination and scaling up of climate-
smart technologies, water resource management, renewable energy, natural resource
management, advocacy and policy and protecting biodiversity. Some of the international
organizations work in selected countries. CARE, for example, works in Kenya and Uganda,
while World Vision works in all the countries in East Africa.
In Kenya, CARE has established a Climate Change Information Centre with programs on
climate change adaption and mitigation. Some of these programmes include Adaptation
Learning Programme for Africa (ALP), LIFT-UP programme and a carbon mitigation project
“Making  Carbon  Finance  for  Sustainable  Agriculture  Work  for  Poor  People”  in  Western
Kenya. Other international organizations working on climate change in East Africa include
UN agencies (UNDP, UNEP, FAO and International Organization for Migration) and donor
agencies (Danish International Development Agency, EU, DFID, United States Agency for
International Development, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Swedish International
Development Agency, German Development Cooperation, and World Bank), research
organizations (International Union for Conservation of Nature, African Centre for Technology
Studies, Practical Action and Worldwide Wildlife Fund), emergency response and
development agencies (Oxfam, SCC VI-Agroforestry Centre, and Heinrich Boell
Foundation).
There are also a number of national organizations working in each country with similar
activities as the international organizations. In Uganda, the national organizations include
Climate Change Concern; Climate and Development Initiatives; Environment Management
for Livelihood Improvement, Uganda Coalition for Sustainable Development and the

49
Participatory Ecological Land Use (PELUM)16. In Kenya, national organizations include
Climate Network Africa, Indigenous Information Network, Kenya Climate Change Working
Group. In Tanzania, the national organizations include Tanzania Traditional Energy
Development and Environment Organization-TaTEDO, Center for Energy, Environment,
Science and Technology (CEEST), Tanzania Forest Conservation Group, Carbon Tanzania,
Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania, Environment Protection Management Services-
EPMS. In Ethiopia, the national organizations include Climate Change Forum, Ethiopian
Catholic Secretariat, Ethiopian Orthodox Church-Development and Inter Church Aid
Commission, Forum for Environment, and Pastoralist Forum for Ethiopia.
4.6.2 Private sector
Private sector involvement in climate change and agriculture in East Africa is very limited. A
private company Cafédirect (the leading British Fairtrade company for hot beverages) and
German Technical Cooperation (GIZ) have jointly piloted a project in Uganda, Tanzania and
Kenya17. The  project  known  as  “Adaptation  for  Smallholders  to  Climate  Change  (AdapCC)”
supports coffee and tea farmers in developing strategies to cope with the risks and impact of
climate change.
In Kenya, a consortium of three companies, UAP Insurance, Syngenta Foundation and
Safaricom (mobile phone company) launched an innovative and affordable crop insurance
program known as Kilimo Salama Plus. The insurance program covers crop producers and
livestock keepers against climate related risks such as drought and flooding. In Ethiopia, a
few private companies are pursuing mitigation activities. For instance, Ethan Biofuels PLC is
involved in connecting industries with international carbon markets to derive benefits from
GHG reduction strategies within their operations. McKinsey & Co in collaboration with
UNDP is currently helping the government to develop National Adaptation Plan under CRGE

16 PELUM is a regional network of over 220 civil society organizations in 10 countries in East, Central and Southern Africa
working on participatory ecological land use management. PELUM  works to improve the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and
the sustainability of farming communities, by fostering ecological land use management. Country chapters include Uganda,
Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Botswana and South Africa.
17 This project is also being piloted in Mexico, Peru and Nicaragua. Other auxiliary roles played by private sector in climate
change project, policy and institutional development in Uganda are mainly consultancy services.  The consultancy are involved in
developing carbon projects and programs for energy and forestry sectors.

50
initiative. McKinsey mainly provides technical assistance and training of government officials
on climate change adaptation and mitigation. In Tanzania, Green Resources ASA and Carbon-
Tanzania are working on afforestation and re-afforestation programs and CDM. The Tanzania
Private Sector Organization (TPSO) and Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industry and
Agriculture (TCCIA) are supporting climate innovations (such as financing, capacity building
and entrepreneurship) into their institutional programmes. Finally, the Zanzibar Seaweed
Cluster Initiative is encouraging farmers to practice organic farming and value addition.
A final category of private sector actors include the agricultural input providers. Seed
companies in Uganda and Ethiopia are involved in breeding and development of new seed
varieties that are drought tolerant. The companies include Nalweyo Seed Co., Mt. Elgon Seed
Co., East Africa Seed Company in Uganda, Pioneer Hi-Bred Seeds in Ethiopia and Monsanto
(in Uganda and Ethiopia). Other private companies involved in seed production in Tanzania
are Cargill hybrid seeds, Pioneer hybrid, INCOFIN Tanzania Ltd, Rotian Seeds Company,
Alpha Seed, Paunar, and East African Seed Company (Appendix V).

5. Conclusion and recommendations
Climate change affects almost every sector of the economy in East Africa, with potential
negative impacts on food security and economic growth. This calls for a multi-faceted
approach and multi-stakeholder involvement. Across the region, various government
departments are leading climate change programs. New climate change units solely charged
with addressing climate change have been formed. The climate change units and programs are
playing a key role in initiating development and research projects, sourcing for funds,
advocating for change and building expertise in climate change.
At the same time, the NAPAs and NAMAs are helping government to direct efforts and
finance towards developing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. However,
countries in the region are still are ill-equipped to address climate change mainly due to huge
financial investment required, lack of human capacity and lack of policies and legal
frameworks. Majority of the climate change projects in agriculture developed mainly focus on
adaptation, with few mitigation projects. Furthermore, the potential for collaboration and
synergy between climate change actors are yet to be fully explored. Based on the findings of
the study, we propose a number of recommendations for consideration by the countries in
East Africa:

Policies on climate change need to be formulated, enacted and legislated for the projects
to get local and financial support as well as improve the coordination of the activities in
the different sectors;

There is need to establish a climate change plan that would prioritize interventions. Kenya
has developed the National Climate Change Response Strategy and the National Climate
Change Action Plan;

Mainstreaming climate change into government sector plans, projects and programs is one
option that can be explored to holistically address agricultural development in East
Africa. In particular, mainstreaming climate change programs into gender, poverty and
food security initiatives is desperately needed;

Capacity building of all stakeholders and actors in agricultural sector and affiliated
institutions should be strengthened at all levels. Furthermore, each country should create

52
synergy and set priorities among the players in climate change and identifying potential
areas for collaboration;

Strengthen coordination and collaboration between different climate change actors to
maximize the desired outcomes. Even though all governments have designated lead
agencies for climate change, there is lack of information sharing and lack of inventory in
terms of coordinating and collaborating in tackling climate change in various sectors in all
the countries. Mapping of all past and current adaptation and mitigation initiatives in
agriculture, programs and projects should be undertaken and made publicly available;

There are opportunities to link and mainstream existing poverty reduction and food
security projects and programs with climate change initiatives to realize their full
potential and derive some carbon financial incentives;

Majority of climate change projects and programs in agriculture and forestry are mainly
financed by donor agencies and international organizations and mostly dispersed in the
rural areas, away from government limelight. Since most donor-funded programs are
short-term, the governments need to play a proactive role in financing and
implementation of these programs to achieve sustained and lasting results;

Agriculture contributes significantly to East Africa economies, and driven mainly by
women, special consideration need to be given to women as they will be adversely
affected by climate change;

Increasing food production and ensuring food security requires agricultural intensification
on existing cropland. However, without appropriate agricultural technologies,
intensification might contribute to land degradation. Therefore, formulation of a
comprehensive land and water management strategy needs to be in place;

There are opportunities for different stakeholders involved in agricultural research to
undertake research on climate smart technologies, develop extension and dissemination
strategies to improve adoption of climate smart technologies and, strategies for linking
farmers to carbon markets and financing.

Research Priorities
Ethiopia
 Developing drought and heat tolerant crop cultivars
 Application of seasonal climate forecast  & downscaling of climate models to be used at national and specific
regions of the country
 Weather Index based insurance for farmers
 Developing improved animal feed variety that can withstand climate variability
 Promoting agroforestry, soil and water conservation, sustainable land management practices
 Reducing emission from crop residues and promotion of organic fertilizers
 Enhancing diversification and intensification. Scaling up production and demand of product from low-emitting
animals (poultry, sheep, goat and fishery) to reduce emissions associated with large ruminants including cattle
and camels
 Rangeland and pastureland management. Introduction and promotion of appropriate techniques to increase soil
carbon content and productivity of pastureland in highland areas and rangeland within pastoral areas.
 Agricultural through usage of improved inputs and better residue management resulting in a decreased
requirement intensification for additional agricultural land that would primarily be taken from forests
 Create new agricultural land in degraded areas through small, medium, and large-scale irrigation to reduce the
pressure on forests
Kenya
 Climate change and water use in Garissa and Trans Mara. This project is yet to be launched and it entails
vulnerability assessment of small-scale farmers and pastoralists to climate change.
 Food security and climate change
 Climate Smart agriculture – 9 small-scale projects of the CCU. The projects’ objective is taking ‘climate smart
agriculture’ (agricultural production that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to climate change, and reduce
vulnerability) to farmers
 Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Agribusiness Project–research on climate resilient crop varieties and
livestock breeds.
 Vulnerability and climate change.
 Carbon mitigation project – involves assessing the possibility of carbon finance on 15400 acres of land.
 Adapt to climate change and Insurance - 3-year pilot project to be implemented in 6 districts in Busia and
Nyando counties. The project has 3 core areas: 1) adoption of agricultural practices suitable for climate change
adaptation such as growing of drought resistant crops; 2) introduction of agricultural insurance scheme where
identification of appropriate insurance products will be done and later discussed with insurance firms; 3)
monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of the project on farmers.
