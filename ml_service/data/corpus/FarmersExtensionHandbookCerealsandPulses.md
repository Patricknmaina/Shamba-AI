FOREWORD
Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) is one of the
key partners in the Kenya Cereals Enhancement Programme - Climate Resilient
Agricultural Livelihoods Window (KCEP-CRAL) Programme funded by the
European Union (EU) and implemented by the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD). KALRO participation in this programme is based on proven
experience and expertise in agricultural research. Within the programme, KALRO
handles the research component, conducting on station and on farm trials, develops
farmer recommendations together with training materials for extension staff and
service providers and conducts the training. The implementation of KCEP-CRAL is
in thirteen (13) counties namely Nakuru, Nandi, Trans Nzoia, Kakamega, Bungoma,
Kitui, Tharaka-Nithi, Embu, Machakos, Makueni, Taita Taveta, Kwale and Kilifi.
KCEP-CRAL focuses on the three leading rain-fed cereals (maize, sorghum and
millet) and associated pulses (beans, green grams, cowpeas and pigeon peas). The
programme’s overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of rural poverty and
food insecurity of smallholder farmers.
Through this Handbook, the programme will provide a comprehensive guide to
extension officers, service providers and lead farmers on how to successfully produce
cereals and pulses in Kenya. The Handbook is a useful training and reference material
for extension officers and other stakeholders seeking to enhance the capacity of
farmers, increase commercialization for food security and promote gender inclusion
and participation along the commodity value chains.
Initial lessons learnt in this project indicate that enhancing the capacity of the
extension staff and service providers has improved uptake of new technologies for
dry land farming. It has opened up more land for farming through use of conservation
agriculture in areas that hitherto were not under agriculture. Besides easing the
pressure on previously arable land, farmers in the project areas have been trained
to use alternative disease and pest management regimes using Integrated Disease
and Pest Management and Push pull technologies for persistent pests of economic
importance.
On behalf of KALRO, I am grateful to the European Union for supporting this project
through the IFAD and KCEP-CRAL of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock,
Fisheries and Cooperatives (MoALF&C). I also appreciate the excellent coordination
of the whole process by the KCEP-CRAL Secretariat led by Dr Anthony O. Esilaba,
MoALF&C and other partners, scientists in participating centres, Knowledge,
Information and Outreach Unit team and secretarial staff. It is my hope and desire
that in using this Handbook, the expectations of all stakeholders will be met.

OVERVIEW
The agriculture sector is important to Kenya’s economy. It contributes 33% of the
country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) directly, 27% of GDP indirectly and accounts
for 65% of export earnings. It also provides livelihood for most of the Kenyan population
through employment opportunities to the rural population and 40% of the country’s
total population. Agriculture contributes Kenya’s food security through production,
distribution and availability of safe, and nutritious food. It is a large and complex sector,
many public, parastatal, non-governmental and private players. It is a fully devolved
the function of the County Governments in ensuring food security. Apart from food
production, the Agricultural sector is the main driver of non-agricultural economy
within the country comparing manufacturing, building/construction, transportation,
tourism, education and other social services.
Despite the important role played by Agricultural sector in the Country’s’ economy, its
growth and stability has been continuously affected by many factors. Climate change
potentially is one of the greatest challenges particularly within farming communities.
Climatic risks, marked by increased recurrence of droughts, floods, rainfall variability
(pattern, timing and intensity), increased mean surface temperature and famine that
erode livelihood opportunities and community resilience. Other sources of risks include
declining water resources, soil fertility and, increased pests and diseases. Sustainable
agricultural production calls for adoption of approaches that sustainably increase
agricultural productivity and incomes while adapting and building resilience to climate
change, and reducing greenhouse emissions. These approaches include: Climate Smart
Agriculture (CSA), conservation agriculture (CA) and agroforestry among others.
Continued supply of nutrients required by plants in correct forms and quantities require
soil health management achieved through application of inorganic fertilisers, organic
farmyard manure, compost, plant residues and practicing crop rotation. In a nutshell,
this is applying integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) or Sustainable Soil
Management (SSM). Within the Sustainable Development Goals, soil fertility/health
maintenance is of economic, social and environmental importance because it supports
healthy plants and livestock growth leading to adequate food provision and healthy
individuals. The resultant healthy crops and livestock generate income when sold as
well as income from employment opportunities in the production, value addition and
marketing phases.
Farmers should strive to conduct their farming with a business orientation geared to
the market. However, farming is certainly a risky business, depended upon the factors
of production, domestic prices, changes in foreign markets and climate change and
variability. To succeed in farming business, just like any other business, several crucial
principles should be applied. This calls individual farmers to develop a passion because
only passion can take the entrepreneur far into any business including farming. Without
passion, one cannot last in farming; commitment to continuous learning. Applying
business methods such as record keeping, benefit–cost analysis, marketing skills, group
management skills, gender considerations and good communication skills can greatly

x
improve the efficiency of farming. Understanding farm records and record keeping as
well as marketing dynamics especially for cereals and pulses is very important.
The cereals covered in this hand book comprise of maize, sorghum and millet. Maize
is a staple food and contributes about 65% of daily per capita cereal consumption, 35%
of total dietary energy and 32% of total protein consumption. It is an important source
of carbohydrate, protein, iron, vitamin B, and minerals. It serves both as subsistence
and commercial crop. It grows on an estimated 1.4 million hectares comprising 25%
large-scale and 75% smallholder farmers. Maize accounts for more than 20% of
the total agricultural production and 25% of agricultural employment. However, its
production has been decreasing due to climate change and variability. Sorghum is a
drought tolerant crop that plays an important role as a food security crop in semi-arid
areas (SALs) of Kenya. It has an extensive root system which makes it very efficient
at extracting any water from the soil. It can survive drought conditions for weeks by
rolling up its leaves and thus decreasing water loss through the leaves. It is a high-
energy, nutritious food, suitable for consumption by all. It is particularly recommended
for children, lactating mothers, convalescents and the elderly. The grain has high levels
of iron and zinc, hence may be used to reduce micro-nutrient malnutrition. Millet on
the other hand is an important food security crop in semi-arid lands of Kenya. It fits
well in popular local recipes such as Ugali and Uji. In recognition of its nutrition value
and frequent maize crop failures, the Government of Kenya is putting more emphasis
on production of millet to mitigate food and nutritional security.
The pulses covered include beans, green grams, pigeon peas and cowpeas. Bean is
the most important pulse in Kenya ranking second to maize in importance. The crop
provides cheap protein source, rich in essential amino acids such as lysine which is found
in fewer quantities in maize and other grains. Despite its importance, production over
the years has majorly remained at subsistence level with limited commercialization.
Optimal production has continuously been limited by poor agronomic practices such as
use of uncertified seeds, poor soil health management practices, poor pest and disease
management practices and climate change effects. Green gram is an erect annual plant
which grows to a height of 60-70 cm tall. It is often cultivated in rotation or relay with
cereals and consumed as whole seeds boiled with cereals such as maize or sorghum
and occasionally in stews. Pigeon pea is a perennial legume that is highly adapted to
dry environments. It can grow to 12 ft. tall, but usually only reaches 3 to 6 ft. It has
very deep roots which enables it to take up nutrients and water from lower subsoil
layers. Cowpea ranks second to beans in importance as vegetable protein food crops.
It is mainly grown as a green leafy vegetable in Western Kenya and for grain in the dry
lands of Eastern, Coast and Nyanza regions. The grain is rich in protein content of up to
30%, including micronutrients such as iron and zinc. Despite its importance, its yields
have remained either low or stagnant due to low soil fertility, poor agronomic practices,
pest and diseases and poor postharvest management. These aspects of production are
poised to be addressed by increased awareness created by this Project.

1.  CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE
The impact of climate change and variability on Kenya’s agricultural sector is of
great concern to policymakers, researchers, development partners, farmers and other
stakeholders. It is a big threat to achieving food security. This handbook presents
improved ways on adapting agricultural production systems to climate change
indicators, namely, increased temperatures, unpredictable rainfall, and extreme
climatic occurrences. The effects of climate change and variability are characterized
by increased frequency of droughts and floods, changes in weather patterns, high
rainfall intensity and increased incidence of pests and disease outbreaks. Below find
pictures of these effects on crop production systems.
Increased land degradation due to
climate change
Increased water scarcity
Increased pests and disease incidence
Decreased crop yields
Increased incidence of floods
Decreased crop yields

1.1  What Causes Climate Change and Variability?
Figure 1.1: Causes of climate
change in agriculture
•
It is largely linked directly and indirectly
to human activities
•
Carbon dioxide remains the major
greenhouse gas that contributes to climate
change
•
The major agricultural activities linked
to climate change include land clearing
and burning plant biomass for farming,
charcoal burning, conventional tillage,
poor manure handling, and inappropriate
use of agro-chemicals, among others
(Figure 1.1).
1.2  Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) comprises agricultural practices and techniques
that are aimed at sustainably increasing agricultural production and system resilience
while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, CSA aims to achieve food
security and broader development goals under a changing climate and increasing
food demand. Consequently, CSA practices are made to suit three main pillars:
increasing agricultural production and incomes, enhancing resilience (adaptation)
of livelihoods/ecosystems and reducing GHG emissions. This handbook describes
key approaches that conserve the soil, rain water, soil nutrients and stabilize
land production. The approaches are based on three principles; minimum tillage,
permanent soil cover and crop rotation.
1.3 Characteristics of climate smart farms (Climate-smartness
indicators)
•
Soil and water conservation structures or measures to increase ground cover
and use little water
•	 Use of manure and compost to decrease
use of chemical fertilizers
•	 Promotion of agroforestry (crops and
trees) systems i.e. trees and crops coexist and
benefit from each other
•	 Integration of perennial and annual crops
•	 Diversification of farm enterprises
•	 Readiness of a farm plan (Figure 1.2, Table
1.1 and 1.2).

1.4  CSA Practices and their Benefits
1.4.1  Conservation Agriculture
What is Conservation Agriculture? – It is a method of farming system that
conserves, improves and uses natural resources more efficiently through sustainable
intensification (integration) of locally available resources.

4
1.4.2  Principles of Conservation Agriculture
A.	Minimum soil disturbance - The farmer tills the soil as
little as possible or disturbs the soils as little as possible.
The soil should only be dug where the seed, fertilizer
and manure are placed when sowing. Some of the
benefits of minimum soil disturbance include improved
soil water infiltration, build-up of soil organic matter,
reduced cost of tilling the land, reduced soil degradation
etc.
B.	Permanent soil cover – a farmer uses crop residues,
cover crops, tree biomass to provide maximum soil
cover. The cover crops include cowpeas, velvet beans,
soya beans, common beans. Some of the benefits of
permanent soil cover include reduced soil erosion, more
water sinking into the soil, suppresses emergence of
weeds, organic residues improve organic matter content
and soil nutrient status.
C.	Crop diversification - growing several crops on the
same land through crop rotation or intercropping
systems. Some of the benefits include improved soil
fertility, reduced pests and diseases, increased income,
1.4.3  Benefits of conservation agriculture
A.	 Economic – saves resources like finances; controls pests and diseases; reduces
risks of crop failure; increased farm output and incomes; improved soil water
management; reduced labour use etc.
B.	 Environmental – improved soil health; reduced greenhouse gas emissions and
water use; improved water infiltration etc.
C.	 Agronomic - Increase in soil organic matter – good soil environment for crop
development.

1.5  Soil and Water Conservation Measures
Soil conservation is the prevention and reduction of the amount of soil lost through
erosion.

6
Water conservation is a way of tapping as much water as possible and storing it in
tanks or reservoirs.
1.5.1  Principles of soil and water conservation
a)	 Make effective use of soil water reserves
b)	 Use rainwater effectively
c)	 Take measures to avoid run off
d)	 Reduce water losses through drainage
1.5.2  Benefits of soil and water conservation
a)	 Minimizes the risk of crop/production failure during droughts, intra-
seasonal droughts and floods
b)	 Reduces water erosion, improves water quality, water infiltration and
retention, all of which should lead to higher and less variable yields.
c)	 Controlling soil erosion improves crop and pasture yields.
d)	 Conserving water makes it available for crops, livestock and domestic use
over a longer period.
e)	 They increase the value of the land.
f)	 More and better livestock fodder is available.
g)	 Increases water use efficiency.
1.5.3  Common Soil and Water conservation technologies
a)	 Field level practices: Bench terraces, Check dams, Contour bunds and
hedgerows, ‘Fanya juu’ terraces, Planting Pits/Zai pits, Katumani Pits, Stone
lines, Trash lines, Grass strips, Grassed waterway, Retention ditches, Cut-off
Drains, Mulching and Cover crops.
b)	 Landscape level practices: Agroforestry, Wind breaks/shelter belts,
woodlots, Riparian vegetation buffer strips. Large flows are diverted and
either used directly or stored for supplementary irrigation.
1.6  Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM)
ISFM is a set of soil fertility management practices that necessarily include the use
of fertilizer, organic inputs, and improved germplasm combined with the knowledge
on how to adapt these practices to local conditions, aiming at maximizing agronomic
use efficiency of the applied nutrients and improving crop productivity. All inputs
need to be managed following sound agronomic principles of ISFM.
1.7  Gender in Climate Smart Agriculture
It is important to recognize and adequately address the particular needs, priorities,
and realities of men, women and youth to equally benefit them in the design

7
and application of any CSA practice. For example, women and youth typically
have less access than men to assets, knowledge and resources. They do not have
the same capacity to take up new climate-smart practices for improved climate
change resilience. A clear understanding of gender dynamics will therefore lead to
significant improvements in the lives of smallholder farmers as well as achieving
more sustainable results (Figures 1.3a & b).
Figures 1.3a & b: Gender roles

2  INTEGRATED SOIL FERTILITY AND WATER
MANAGEMENT
Soil is the most valuable and widespread natural resource. However there is a
general decline in land productivity due to declining soil fertility arising from
continuous mining of soil nutrients and inappropriate farming practices. For
sustainable agriculture production there is need to aim at achieving high yields per
unit of land while at the same time conserving soil resources.
2.1  What is soil?
To a farmer: soil provides the medium
where plants grow.
To an Agronomist: soil is unconsolidated
layer of the earth’s surface that consist of
mineral or organic material, air, water and
living organisms that supports plant growth..
Figure 2.1: Soil Profile
2.2  Soil Composition
Soil is composed of mineral particles from weathered underlying rocks, plants and
animals residues (organic matter), living organisms, air and soil water. The relative
amount of each component within a given soil determines the properties of the soils
in that area.
2.3  Soil Properties
Soil properties are divided into physical, chemical and biological.
2.3.1  Soil physical properties
Soil physical properties includes: texture, structure, bulk density, porosity,
consistence, depth/horizonation and colour (Figure 2.1).
Soil texture is the proportions of sand, silt and clay within a soil. This results into
textural classes such as sand, loam, clay loam, clay, and silt among others.
Soil structure refers to the arrangement of primary soil particles/ aggregates into
secondary aggregates. A well-structured moist soil contains about 50% of solid
material by volume and 25% each of air and water.
Bulk density is an indication of soil compactness while porosity is the ratio of the
volume of the pores to the total soil volume and is inversely related to bulk density.
Consistence is the ability of soil to resist rapture or deformation. It is a good
indication of whether the soil is loose, soft, hard, sticky, firm or friable under
different moisture levels and it helps in making decisions on use of farm implements.
Soil horizonation refers to soil depth. Depending on soil formation and climate,

9
some soils are shallow and others very deep. This properties determine the ability of
soils to provide water, nutrients and good environment for plant growth and yield.
They are also used to show land that has been suffering waterlogging conditions as
well as favourable construction sites.
2.3.2  Soil chemical properties
Soil pH, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Anion Exchange Capacity (AEC) and
Buffering Capacity (BC) are some of the most important chemical properties.
•
Soil pH, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Anion Exchange Capacity (AEC)
and Buffering Capacity (BC) are some of the most important chemical
properties.  Soil pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity of a soil. The pH
for acidic soil is below 5.5 while alkaline soils are above 7.5. A pH range
between 6.5- 7 is the best because most plant nutrients are available for most
of the crops and soil organisms to thrive.
•
Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is the ability of soils to maintain adequate
cations (positively charged ions such as potassium, calcium etc. in the
soil solution while anion exchange capacity (AEC) is the ability of soil to
maintain adequate anions (negatively charged ions e.g. nitrates, sulphates
etc.) in the soil solution. This properties determines whether the soil is fertile
or infertile.
•
Organic matter or manure application is important because it contributes to
improvement of all soil properties namely texture, structure, porosity, water
holding capacity, adds nutrients to the soil leading to improved soil CEC
and AEC and regulates changes in pH because manure is a strong buffering
agent.
2.3.3  Biological properties
Soils contain a wide range of soil organisms (fauna and flora). These organisms
include micro-organisms (e.g. bacteria, fungi, protozoa and nematodes), macro
organisms (e.g. spiders and springtails earthworms and termites) and plant roots.
These organisms are important in provision of nutrients through breakdown and
decomposition of organic matter as well as loosening soils for root penetration.
2.4  Traditional soil fertility indicators
A fertile soil can be identified using local indicators.
•
Structure – a soil with big clods indicates a fertile soil
•
Weed species associated with either a poor or  a fertile soil e.g. the grassy
weed called poverty grass (Rhynchelytrum repens) occurs in very infertile
soils
•
Dominance of certain weed flora (e.g. Commelina benghalensis, Bidens
pilosa, Galinsoga parviflora, Commelina diffusa and Amaranthus spp.)
imply high fertility
•
Dominance of soil fauna (e.g. earthworms) also imply high fertility.

10
2.5  Plant nutrients and their roles on crop production
Plants require 17 elements to grow well and complete their life cycle. Some of these
elements are obtained from the air such as carbon and oxygen while others such as
hydrogen and oxygen are obtained from water and the rest (Nitrogen, Phosphorus,
Potassium, Calcium, Sulphur, Magnesium, Zinc, Molybdenum, Boron, Iron,
Cobalt, Manganese, copper and Nickle) are obtained soil. The concentration of
these elements within a given soil is depended on soil type and fertility management
levels. Lack of adequate proportions of this nutrients within a given soil leads to
poor crop establishment or growth resulting to poor yields (Table 2.1 and Figure
2.2).

2.6  Important nutrients sources
Plant nutrients can be obtained from organic amendments such as organic matter and
in-organic sources such as chemical fertilizers.
2.7  Organic amendments
Organic amendments refers to any
material that is part of or originated from
living organisms. They include farmyard
manure, compost, green manure, chicken
manure, urban waste, sewage.
2.7.1  Characteristics and benefits of
manure
•
Main source of organic
amendments and also supply macro, and
micronutrients.
•
Provision of soil nutrients
•
Buffering soil pH to avoid instant changes on application of alkaline or
acidifying inputs.
•
Enhances water-retaining capacity
•
Creates favorable conditions for soil micro-organisms
•
Improves soil structure and consistence.
•
Unlike inorganic fertilizers that provide nutrient immediately, manure has to
decompose first to release nutrients.
2.8  In-organic sources
In-organic fertilizers or mineral/chemical fertilizers are manufactured products that
contain minimum of one plant nutrient that is essential for plant growth. They are
concentrated sources of essential nutrients in a form that is readily available for plant
uptake.
Figure 2.2: Source of soil nutrients

13
2.8.1  Characteristics of chemical fertilizers
•
Rich sources of plant nutrients but don’t contain organic matter.
•
When exposed to the atmosphere, tend to cake by absorbing moisture therefore
need proper handling and storage.
•
Nitrate-based fertilizers (such as ammonium nitrate) can become explosive in
nature if not stored properly.
•
Majority provide one or two plant nutrient, such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
or potassium (K).
•
Show a quick response and become available to plants immediately on application.
2.8.2  Classification of in-organic/chemical fertilizer products
Common inorganic fertilizers are marketed as either straight or compound fertilizers.
For example:
Nitrogenous (N): Ammonium Nitrate (AN), Ammonium Sulphate (AS), Urea and
Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN), NPK.
Phosphatic (P2O5): Single Super Phosphate (SSP), Triple Super Phosphate (TSP), NPK
Potassium oxide (K2O):  Muriate of Potash (MOP), Sulphate of Potash (SOP), NPK.
Apart from the above mentioned, many varied brands with different combinations of
both macro and micro elements are available in the market.
2.9  Soil fertility degradation and amelioration
Soil fertility degradation is the loss of the capacity of soil to supply nutrients in
adequate amounts. Common causes of soil degradation include continuous removal of
plant residues (nutrient mining), soil acidification, salinization, sodicification, erosion,
leaching, poor tillage practices, urbanization, pollution, and loss of organic matter.
2.9.1  Nutrient mining
The amount of nutrients removed through cropping depends on type of crop grown,
part of crop harvested, stage of growth at harvest and level of nutrient replenishment
overtime. Nutrient mining problem can be corrected by cultural methods such as leaving
crop residues in the farm or application of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Nutrient
expert tool can also be used in the management of nutrient mining.
2.9.2  Soil acidity
Causes of soil acidity include acidic parent material, leaching of base cations and
continuous nutrient mining through crop removal, use of acidifying fertilizers such as
ammonium rich fertilizers, acid rain and industrial emissions e.tc. Acidification leads
to unavailability of some essential nutrients such as phosphorus for plant uptake and
abundance of other nutrients such as micronutrients leading to toxicity. Some important
soil macro and microorganisms also do not thrive well in acidic soils leading to poor soil
biological processes hence low fertility levels.  Soil acidity can be corrected through
liming with pure calcium carbonate or dolomitic lime, application of wood ashes and
manure/organic matter.

14
2.9.3  Soil compaction
Occurs as a result of poor tillage methods such as ploughing and hoeing which
result in the formation of hard pans or hard plough layer leading to poor water, air
and root penetration. Corrective measures include; sub soiling and ripping to break
the impermeable plough-pan, avoid ploughing when the soil is very wet. In addition,
mulching and addition of manures improve soil structure in compacted soil.
2.9.4  Soil erosion
Soil erosion is one of the major causes of land degradation in Africa which causes
washing away of top fertile soils leading soil compaction, poor water infiltration rates
and poor fertility levels hence poor crop yields. Corrective measures include, increased
vegetation, use of embankments, contour cultivation, strip cropping, use of cover crops
and conservation tillage
2.9.5  Salinization and sodicification
Salinization and sodicification refers to accumulation of salts in soils. This is caused
by original mineralogy of the soil, over application of base fertilizers, and /or poor
movement of salts within the soil because of lack of adequate moisture in dry lands.
Accumulation of salts leads to occlusion of some important nutrients such as phosphorus
hence making them unavailable for plant uptake and also abundance and toxicity of
other nutrients/ salts such as calcium or sodium with their carbonates and bi carbonates
which leads to burning of plant roots or hindering some important soil organisms from
thriving.
2.9.6  Leaching
Leaching is carrying away of soil nutrients beyond the reach of crop roots. It is very
common in areas with high rainfall intensity (>30 mm/day) and in coarse-textured
sandy soils (>35% sand).  Corrective measures include application of manures and
nutrient replenishment.
2.10  Soil Fertility Evaluation
Continuous maintenance of good crop yield requires regular soil fertility maintenance.
The fertility maintenance is done through regular fertility status evaluation which is
carried out through soil or plant tissues sampling and analysis.
2.10.1  Soil sampling and basic soil parameter measurements
What to consider when undertaking soil sampling i.e. identifiers of soil fertility;
•
Topography, soil types, soil colour
•
Land degradation intensities,
•
Sharp physical discontinuities (e.g. rocky outcrops),
•
Land-use history or distance from the homestead and livestock facilities.

15
2.10.2  Frequency of soil sampling and number of samples
•
New land- done yearly for first few years until you understand the soil.
•
Cultivated land- every 2-3 years, unless concern for environmental problems.
•
Sample at least one month before onset of rains to provide enough time for
analysis/amendments.
•
Number of samples is normally determined by type of anticipated enterprise,
land physical attributes and observable diversity. Agronomists normally
recommend one composite sample per 2.5 acres or 1Ha or at least one composite
sample per acre for uniform land. The composite samples are then taken to the
laboratory for analysis (Figure 2.3).
Figure 2.3: Steps in soil sampling
2.10.3  Soil analysis reports
•
When the soil is analyzed in a credible laboratory, soil analysis report is always
provided.
•
The soil test reports contain values that indicate specific nutrient levels in
the soil. The levels are either indicated as low, moderate, adequate or high. A
summary of these levels implies availability of low, moderate or high fertility.
Soil fertility replenishment recommendation is then provided based on the report
and the intended crop to be grown.
2.11  Soil Degradation, its Causes and Management
Soil degradation is the decline in soil quality as a result of improper land use
activities such as inappropriate agricultural intensification and farming practices,
intensive grazing and unsustainable urban or industrial expansion. It involves the
decline of the soil’s physical, biological and chemical quality. It can be the loss of
organic matter, decline in soil fertility and structural condition, erosion, adverse
changes in salinity, acidity or alkalinity, and the effects of toxic chemicals, pollutants
or excessive flooding. Soil degradation may occur naturally, due to climate change or
human activities.

16
2.11.1 Causes of soil degradation include physical, chemical and biological factors
a)	 Physical Factors
Physical factors such as rainfall, surface runoff, floods, wind erosion, tillage, and
mass movements result in the loss of fertile top spoil thereby declining soil quality.
b)	 Soil erosion
Soil erosion refers to the wearing away of a land’s topsoil by the natural physical
forces of water and wind or through forces associated with farming activities such
as tillage (Table 2.2). Soil erosion occurs through a number of ways that include
water and wind erosion.
Table 2.2: Types of erosion
Sheet and rill erosion
Sheet erosion occurs when
a thin layer of topsoil is
removed over a whole hillside
paddock—and may not be
readily noticed.
Rill erosion occurs when runoff
water forms small channels as it
concentrates down a slope. These
rills can be up to 0.3m deep. If
they become any deeper than 0.3
m they are referred to as gully
erosion.
Scalding
Scalding can occur when
wind and water erosion
removes the top soil and
exposes saline or sodic soils.
Gully erosion
Occurs when runoff concentrates and flows
strongly enough to detach and move soil
particles. Gullies may develop in watercourses
or other places where runoff concentrates. In
cultivation or pastures, advanced rill erosion
can develop into gully erosion.
Stream bank erosion
When clods of these soils are exposed to water,
they readily break down into individual particles
of sand, silt and clay which are easily removed
as water moves through the subsoil. The major
cause of stream bank erosion is the destruction
of vegetation on river banks (by clearing,
overgrazing, cultivation, vehicle traffic up and
down banks or fire) and the removal of sand and
gravel from the stream bed.
c)	 Chemical Factors
This is the reduction of soil nutrients due to alkalinity, acidity, water logging
or removal of nutrients through crop harvests. The chemical factors are mainly
alterations in the soil’s chemical property that determine nutrient availability.

17
d)	 Biological Factors
Biological factors refer to the human and plant activities that tend to reduce
the quality of soil. Some bacteria and fungi overgrowth in an area can highly
reduce microbial activity in the soil through leading to decreased organic matter
breakdown, decomposition and availability of nutrients within soil for plant
uptake hence reduced crop yields.
e)	 Deforestation
This is the removal of trees and crop cover exposing soil minerals to adverse
weather effects. Vegetation cover promotes binding of soil together and soil
formation, hence when it is removed it considerably as affects soil health. It also
reduces landscapes carbon sequestration ability.
f)	 Misuse or excessive use of fertilizers and chemicals
Excessive use and the misuse of pesticides and chemical fertilizers kill organisms
that assist in breaking down and decomposing organic matter to increase soil
fertility. It also kills beneficial soil organisms that kill soil pests.
g)	 Industrial and Mining activities
Industrial and mining activity destroys crop cover and releases various toxic
chemicals such as heavy metals (mercury) into the soil thereby poisoning it and
rendering it unproductive. It also releases toxic effluents and material wastes
into the atmosphere, land, rivers, and ground water that eventually pollute the
soil. Industrial and mining activities degrade the soil’s physical, chemical and
biological properties.
h)	 Improper cultivation practices
Improper tillage on agricultural lands breaks up soil into finer particles, which
increase erosion rates. It also exposes soil organisms and organic matter to the
surface leading to fertility lose. Shallow cultivation leads to soil pan that hinders
root penetration.
i)
Urbanization
Removes the soil’s vegetation cover, compacts soil during construction, and
alters the drainage pattern. Most of the runoff and sediments from urban areas
are polluted with oil, fuel, and other chemicals. Increased runoff from urban areas
also causes a huge disturbance to adjacent water sheds by changing the rate and
volume of water that flows through them.
j)	 Overgrazing
Overgrazing destroys surface crop cover and breaks down soil particles, increasing
the rates of soil erosion which affects soil quality.
2.12  Soil and Water and Management Practices
Soil water management can be defined as active involvement in controlling soil
water content at an optimal state for all given purposes, including environmental

18
needs. An optimal state is often a compromise between competing uses and needs
to account for long-term sustainability of the soil water system.
The line between soil and water conservation (SWC) and rainwater harvesting
(RWH) technologies for crop production is very thin. SWC can be described as
activities that reduce water losses by runoff and evaporation, while maximizing in-
soil moisture storage for crop production, but the same could be said of RWH. The
two are differentiated by the fact that under soil and water conservation, rainwater
is conserved in-situ wherever it falls, whereas under water harvesting, a deliberate
effort is made to transfer runoff water from a “catchment” to the desired area or
storage structure.
2.12.1 Principles of rainwater harvesting and management
•
Harvesting and storage increases the availability of water in the drier
seasons.
•
Develop structures such as contour ditches, terracing, pits and bunds to
reduce run-off and increase water availability for crops.
•
Reduce water lose in the soil by adding organic matter in the form of
compost, manures or plant residues.
There are two types of rain water harvesting i.e. in-situ and ex-situ.
2.12.2  Soil and Water Conservation Technologies)
Rainwater harvesting for infiltration, also known as in-situ water harvesting, is a
practice in which rainwater uptake in soils is increased through the soil surface,
rooting system and groundwater. Structures for in-situ water harvesting include:
•
Contour - bunds and hedgerows – Stone or earthen walls built across a
slope to prevent runoff. The aim is to concentrate moisture into the ridge and
furrow area where the crops are planted.
•
Bench terraces - a series of beds which are more or less level running
across a slope at vertical intervals, supported by steep banks or risers (walls
or bunds). They are designed to reduce soil losses; promote permanent
agriculture on steep slopes and intensive land use.
•
Fanya juu terraces - constructed by excavating soil and throwing it up-
slope to make an embankment. The embankment forms a runoff barrier and
the trench (ditch) is used to retain or collect runoff. The embankments are
usually stabilized with fodder grasses.
•
Stone lines - are 25 - 35 cm contour lines made of locally available stones.
They slow down runoff, increase water infiltration and form the basis for
improved production in semi-arid areas.
•
Trash lines - created across the slope along the contour using previous
seasons’ crop residues (millet, maize and sorghum stalks), grasses, litter and
other dead vegetative organic materials. Trash lines control surface runoff,
soil erosion and enhance water infiltration.

19
•
Retention ditches - designed to harvest and retain incoming runoff and hold
it until it infiltrates into the ground. They can be an alternative to waterways
in high rainfall areas.
•
Grass strips - are 1 m-wide strips of grass planted on terraces along
contours to reduce the amount of water flowing down the slope and conserve
soil. Grass strips are planted with fodder grass such as Napier or are left with
natural grass; thereby providing fodder to livestock.
•
Check dams - is a small temporary or permanent barrier constructed of rock,
gravel bags, sandbags, fibre rolls, or reusable products, placed across a gully,
channel or drainage to lower the speed of flows from storm events.
•
Zai pits - are 10-15 cm deep, 15-50 cm wide and 80-100 cm apart. The pits
promote an integrated soil, water and nutrient management by retaining
water.
•
Tied ridges - are small earthen ridges, 30 cm high, with an upslope furrow
which accommodates runoff from a catchment strip between the ridges.
2.12.3  Rainwater harvesting for storage (ex-situ rainwater harvesting)
Rainwater harvesting for storage, also known as  ex-situ  water harvesting, is a
practice in which rainwater is collected and stored for productive use, for example
drinking, agriculture, sanitation and more. Structures for ex-situ water harvesting
include: -
•
Rooftop water harvesting with above ground tank - A roof becomes a
catchment when it is used for harvesting rainwater. Roof catchment systems
provide water that can be used for domestic purposes.
•
Water pans - are shallow depressions (1 m to 3 m deep) constructed to
collect and hold runoff water from various surfaces including from hillsides,
roads, rocky areas and open rangelands.
•
Small earthen dams - its constructed either on-stream or off-stream, where
there is a source of large quantities of channel flow. The dam wall is 2 - 5 m
high and has a clay core and stone aprons and spillways to discharge excess
runoff.
•
Sand dams – it is a wall constructed across the stream to restrict surface
flow. The height of the dam wall is increased by 0.3 m after floods have
deposited sand to the level of the spillway.
•
Wells and boreholes - water obtained from underground sources.
2.12.4  Soil moisture conservation techniques
•
The goal is to minimize the amount of water lost from the soils through
evaporation (water loss directly from the soil) and transpiration (water loss
occurring through the plants) – or combined, the evapotranspiration.
•
Preserving soil moisture is important for agricultural production, and also
helps minimize irrigation needs of the crops.

20
2.12.5  Methods for soil moisture conservation include: -
•
Spreading manure or compost over the soil – this minimizes
evapotranspiration and also provides valuable nutrients to the soil through
decomposition
•
Mulching – placing a layer of organic (or inorganic) material at the root
zone of the plants.
•
Conservation tillage- reducing or in extreme cases completely eliminating
tillage to maintain soil structure and increase soil organic matter that
improves soils capacity to absorb and retain water.
•
Crop rotation – growing different types of crops every other season -
improves soil structure; water holding capacity; soil fertility; and helps
control pests and diseases.
•
Green manure – growing of plant materials with the purpose of adding
organic matter to the soil. The improved soil quality then also improves
water retention capacity.
•
Mixed cropping intercropping and inter-planting – involves cultivating
a combination of crops with different planting times and different length of
growth periods.
•
Contour ploughing –ploughing along the contour instead of up- and
downward slopes, reduces water velocity, creating even barriers, and
more water is retained in the soils and distributed more equally across the
cropland.
•
Strip cropping - growing erosion permitting crops and erosion resisting
crops in alternate strips.
2.13  Problematic Soils and their Management
Problematic or problem soils refer to soils that possess characteristics that make
them uneconomical for cultivation of crops without adopting proper reclamation
measures. We have three major types of problem soils:
•
Physical problem soils
•
Chemical problem soils
•
Biological problem soils.
2.13.1  Soils with Physical Problems for Agricultural Production
These are soils whose physical properties have some limitations. They include:
impermeable soils, soil surface crusting and sealing, subsoil hardpan, shallow soils,
highly permeable soils, heavy clay soils and fluffy paddy soils.
2.13.2  Soils with unfavourable Chemical Properties for Agricultural
Production
The major soils in this category are acidic and salt affected soils.

21
a)	 Acid soils
Soil with pH of less than 7 is generally referred to as acid soils. The acidity
level however increases with pH decrease from 7 towards zero with pH levels
lower than 5.5 being strongly acidic and pH of less than 4.75 being extremely
acidic.
Acidity in soils can be caused by mineralogy of parent material, organic matter
accumulation, leaching of base cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium and
sodium), and management practices such as continuous use of acid forming
fertilizers, application of elemental sulphur which undergoes reactions
forming sulphuric acid, tillage practices and soil pollution.
Soil acidity can be managed by application of organic amendments such as
manure. Application of pulverized Limestone or dolomitic limestone is one
the fastest ways to increase soil’s pH or reduction of soil acidity.
b)	 Saline soils
Saline soils are non-sodic soils containing sufficient soluble salt to adversely
affect the growth of most crop plants with a lower limit of electrical
conductivity of the saturated extract (ECe) being 4 deci Siemens / meter
(dS/m), which is equivalent to a value of 4 mm hos/cm. Very salty soils are
sometimes recognizable by a white layer or dry salt on the soil surface.
The saline soil problems are caused by the accumulated soluble salts in the
root zone. In this soil due to high salt levels microbial activity is reduced.
Specific ion effects on plants are also seen due to toxicity of ions like chloride
and sulphates.
The reclamation of saline soils involves basically the removal of salts from
the root zone soil through the processes of leaching with water and drainage.
Provision of lateral and main drainage channels of 60 cm deep and 45 cm wide
and leaching of salts could reclaim the soils.
i)	 Irrigation of Saline Soils
Proportional mixing of good quality (if available) water with saline
water and then using for irrigation reduces the effect of salinity. Alternate
furrow irrigation favours growth of plant than flooding. Drip, sprinkler
and pitcher irrigation have been found to be more efficient than the
conventional flood irrigation method since relatively lesser amount of
water is used under these improved methods.
ii)	 Fertilizer Management for Saline soils
Addition of extra dose of nitrogen to the tune of 20-25% of recommended
level will compensate the low availability of N in these soils. Addition of
organic manures like, FYM, compost, etc. helps in reducing the ill effect
of salinity due to release of organic acids produced during decomposition.
Green manuring and or green leaf manuring also counteracts the effects
of salinity.

22
c)	 Sodic soils
Sodic soils are soils containing sufficient exchangeable sodium to adversely
affect the growth of most crop plants. These soils have high levels of
exchangeable sodium (Na) and low levels of total salts caused by natural
presence of minerals producing sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) or sodium bi-
carbonate (NaHCO3) upon weathering. They are usually defined as containing
an exchangeable sodium percentage greater than 15% and a pH of 8.2 or more.
Extreme cases may have a pH of above 10.5. These soils tend to occur within
arid to semiarid regions and are innately unstable, exhibiting poor physical
and chemical properties, which impede water infiltration, water availability,
and ultimately plant growth.
Sodic soils may impact plant growth by: a) Sodium toxicity to sodium sensitive
plants; b) Nutrient deficiencies or imbalances; c) High pH of > 8.0 and d) soil
structure destruction or dispersion or flocculation of clay minerals.
Sodic soils can be reclaimed or managed using several approaches, they
include:
i.
Establishment of sodic tolerant crops
ii.	 Application of organic manures.
iii.	 Application of chemical amendments such as soluble calcium salts
(gypsum, calcium chloride), acids or acid forming substances (sulphuric
acid, iron sulphate, aluminium sulphate, lime-sulphur, and pyrite) or
calcium salts of low solubility like ground limestone. The compounds in
the salts or acids reacts with the sodium carbonate (Na2CO3 or NaHCO3)
forming a leachable compound.
iv.	 Agronomic management such as planting at the edge of hills, leaching,
crop rotation among others.
d) Alkaline soils
Alkaline soils are clay soils with high pH, poor soil structure and low
infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 meter
depth.  The causes of alkaline soils can be natural or man-made. Natural
causes are the presence of minerals producing sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) or
sodium bi-carbonate (NaHCO3) upon weathering. The soils can be reclaimed
by incorporation of grass cultures, organic compost, waste hair and feathers,
organic garbage, acidifying materials (inorganic or organic material) into the
soil, and enhancing dissolved Ca in the field water by releasing CO2 gas. Deep
ploughing and incorporation of the calcareous subsoil into the topsoil also can
be of help.
2.13.3  Soils with unfavourable biological Properties for Agricultural
Production
These include soils with low organic matter content, soil living organisms or
harmful soil living organisms such asbacterial wilt, Fusarium wilt and nematodes.

23
3  FARM-LEVEL AGRICULTURAL RESILIENCE AND
ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change and variability affects agriculture particularly rural livelihoods,
incomes and food security. This is through increased temperatures, changing rainfall
patterns which have become unreliable, increased frequency and intensity of floods and
droughts. Because of this, it is important for farmers to learn and practise appropriate
farm level adaptation measures so as to build their capacity and resilience in food
production systems.
These impacts of climate change on agriculture can be classified into:
•
Crop production i.e. changes in quantity and quality of crop yields, forages
and crop residues; changes in the timing and duration of crop growing seasons;
interference with the coordination of farm activities and distribution of labour
etc.
•
Soil fertility: Reduced soil carbon, soil moisture, soil organisms, vegetation
cover leading the soil prone to erosion, soil degradation.
•
Water availability: flooding, waterlogging or water deficit at the crop
root zone; affect the quality and quantity of water for human and animal
consumption.
•
Livestock production: Poor quality feeds, poor feed yields, increased diseases
and pests, invasive pasture and lose of others from ecosystem.
3.1  What is Resilience?
This is the ability of farm production systems to deal with major climatic shocks such
as rainfall variability, drought, floods, pest infestation and other stresses. This ability
helps the farmer or agricultural system to absorb the stress impact and recover quickly.
3.2  Major Technologies and Management Practices for Enhancing
Farm Level Resilience
3.2.1  Soil Health Management Practices
Soils as a natural resource and base for agricultural productivity is critical in
enhancing farm level resilience. A healthy soil has the capacity to sustain agricultural
production. A health soil should have good tilth, sufficient depth, good water
storage, good drainage, sufficient supply of nutrients, minimal plant pathogens and
insect pests, free from chemicals and toxins, resistant to degradation among others.
This is however impacted by climate change as shown in Table 3.1.

3.3  Rainwater Harvesting and Management Practices
Farm level resilience principles aims at reducing the vulnerability of farmers and
their agricultural systems to water scarcity. This can be achieved by increasing the
availability and access to water during the drier seasons by developing structures (such
as contour schemes, terracing, pits and bunds to reduce `run-off and increase water

25
availability for crops) or reduced water loss in the soil by adding organic matter in the
form of compost, manures or plant residues.
3.4  Water Efficient Irrigation Systems
Drip irrigation technology supports farmers to adapt to climate change by providing
efficient use of water supply (Figure 3.1). The technology saves water by managing
and minimizing evaporation losses, and delivering water at the crop root zone where it
is required. The system consist of elevated water source (tank), pumping unit, filters,
drippers and drip lines which can either be on the surface or sub-surface (buried).
Below is a simple illustration of a drip irrigation system
Figure 3.1: Illustration of simple drip irrigation system
3.5  Contributions Of Drip Irrigation System To Farm Level Resilience
•
Producing more crops with less water.
•
Uses less energy for pumping and conveying water.
•
It has minimal nutrient leaching and local environmental pollution.
•
Contributes to increased food security and incomes since crop production
can be done on and off rain season.
•
Leads to reduced workload for women allowing them to re-allocate their
time and resources to other livelihood activities.
3.6  Seed Management Practices
Seed has direct links to food security and resilient livelihoods. It’s important to
develop seeds that are resilient to current and future climatic shocks. These include:
3.6.1  Use of early maturing crop varieties –
Crop that matches with the rainfall patterns. An example is the “Mwezi Moja” bean
variety that matures within one month.
3.6.2  Adopting heat tolerant crop varieties–
Crops that can withstand increases in temperatures

26
3.6.3  Use of salt tolerant crop varieties-
Crops that survive soil and water conditions that are saline
3.6.4  Contribution of seed management practices to agricultural resilience
1.	 Adopting drought tolerant or faster maturing seed varieties increases
resilience to dry spells and assures them a harvest.
2.	 Adopting drought tolerant or faster maturing seed varieties contributes to food
production. Drought tolerant crops like cassava, millet or sorghum, despite
their low market value, ensure that farm households have at least some food
for consumption when crops like maize fail.
3.	 Adopting drought tolerant, heat tolerant and saline tolerant varieties
contributes to household incomes.
3.7  Crop Management Practices
Crop management is one of the cost-effective methods of building resilience into
agricultural systems. It takes into account seasonal climatic stresses such as changes in
rainfall distribution, increased temperatures, increased incidence of pests and diseases,
extreme floods and sea level rise which will hamper crop yields.  The major crop
practices are;
3.7.1  Use of salt tolerant crop varieties –
Crops that survive soil and water conditions that are saline
3.7.2  Matching crop/varieties with ecology -
You need to plant crops that suit specific environment or farms.
3.7.3  Seeding/seed rate –
When planting make sure that the number of seeds planted per unit area considers
the plant requirements (feeding space), purpose of cultivation (grain, silage, etc.), soil
fertility status, climatic conditions, and other factors to ensure maximum `yield. The
farmers should practice timely planting to maximize on the rainfall
3.7.4  Crop diversification-
This suppresses pest and diseases, assures the farmers a harvest from one of the crops.
3.7.5  Crop fertilization (organic or inorganic fertilizers) –
Fertilizers increases soil fertility that enhances and sustains growth of plants. The type
and quantity of fertilizer to apply should be well identified and farmers should first
know their soil fertility status through soil testing.
3.7.6  Soil Liming –
Overuse of fertilizers, pesticides, mono-cropping and depletion of soil organic matter
might increase soil acidity that negatively affects crops as discussed in section 2.12.2
above. Application of lime provides improves such soils leading to increased crop
growth and yield.

27
3.7.7  Timely harvesting –
Timely harvesting reduces losses and impact on quality. Farmers need to follow crop
harvesting recommendations to avoid losses.
3.7.8  Post-harvest handling –
Selecting appropriate crop handling, processing and storage technology minimize
losses, increases food security, incomes and household resilience
3.7.9  Contributions of seed system management to resilience
•
Crop diversification reduces the susceptibility of the farm to crop pests and
diseases
•
Stabilizes farm production as climate risks do not affect all crops to the same
degree e.g. mixing drought tolerant crops with non-drought tolerant crops
ensures some harvests under drought conditions.
•
Crop diversification ensures that income can be derived from produce as
different crops have different market values.
•
Using nitrogen-fixing plants reduces the amount of money needed to purchase
inorganic fertiliser, thereby reducing the cash expenditure of smallholder
farms.
•
Holds some potential for greater social resilience by building social capital –
crop rotation and mixed cropping are good farm management practices that
ensure that the farm does not become a source of risk for surrounding farms
through the concentration of crop pest and disease as would happen without
crop rotation or mixed cropping.
•
Potential improvement in farm income and job creation.
•
Improved soil quality and reduced erosion.
•
Reduces the risk of crop failure hence enhance farm level incomes and food
security
3.8  Agro-Forestry Management Practice
This is the deliberate practice of growing woody perennials (trees, shrubs) as agricultural
crops alongside other crops and livestock in the same land. It has potential of enhancing
productivity and sustainability. Farmers are recommended to choose the right type of
tree species for their farms.
3.8.1  Contribution of agroforestry management practices to farm level resilience
•
Trees fixes nitrogen which contributes to enhanced soil fertility, crop yields
and general farm productivity.
•
Increased soil fertility have the potential to reduce the impact of droughts in
the farm
•
Tree biomass increases the soil organic matter that leads to increased soil
water infiltration and retention capacity.

28
•
Farm trees stabilizes the soil structure and thereby reduces soil erosion.
•
Sale of agroforestry products such as fodder, woodfuel, honey, medicines,
mulch, vegetables and fruits are sources of income for farmers.
•
Enhanced soil fertility as a result of nitrogen-fixing plants reduces the amount
of money needed to purchase inorganic fertilisers, thereby reducing the cash
expenditure of smallholder farms.
•
Farm diversification through agroforestry reduces both environmental and
economic risks by spreading harvests and income throughout the year.
•
Agroforestry canopy are sinks of GHGs (Carbon) hence mitigating the
impacts of climate change.
3.9  Pests and Diseases Management Practices
Climate change and variability causes highly variable environmental conditions leading
to increased pest and diseases. This phenomena causes reduced crop yields, low quality
of agricultural produce, loss of life, malnutrition, loss of income, loss of crop diversity
and environmental  pollution resulting from increased use of pesticides. Farm level
resilience pest and disease management practices methods include:-.
3.9.1  Biological pest management
This involves the use of biological methods to control pests and diseases. It includes use
of beneficial insects such as ladybirds (predator), digger wasps (parasite) and bacteria
(pathogen) to kill larvae. Push and Pull Technology’ (PPT) can also be used to control
fall armyworms. Through this approach, the potential risks to farmers, plants and
animals are reduced, thereby enhancing farm resilience and long-term environmental
improvements.
3.9.2  Mechanical pest management
Here pests are controlled by non-chemical direct physical measures. It includes hand-
picking to remove insects, tilling to remove weeds and trapping to catch insects or
rodents.
3.9.3  Pesticides pest management:
Pesticides may be chemical, biological or physical agents used to prevent, destroy,
repel, mitigate, harm or kill organisms which are considered to be pests.
3.9.4   Cultural methods for pest management
This methods used alter the plant environment and may include irrigation and
fertilization schedules, early planting, sanitation practices, intercropping (crop rotation,
relay) and use of improved crop varieties.
3.9.5  Integrated pest management (IPM)
This are techniques used to reduce or stop pests and diseases from multiplying. It
includes the introduction of beneficial insects (biological control); using crop-resistant
varieties; improving cleanliness (field and store hygiene); using alternative agricultural

29
practices such as pruning and spraying; improving crop health by either using organic,
inorganic or combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers.
3.9.6  Contribution of pest and disease management practices to farm level
resilience
•
Using biological control, the soil and water pollution is reduced thereby
improving environmental conditions for the farmer.
•
Biological controls are cheaper and easier to access. Therefore, the farmers
have less expenditure implying that profits to the farmer are maximized.
•
By using biological pesticides, farmers will use indigenous knowledge that
is fast disappearing. This will allow farmers contribute to maintaining and
transferring indigenous knowledge on handling crop pests and diseases.
3.10 Livestock, Pasture and Rangeland Management Practices
Climate change and variability is a real threat to the productivity of rangelands.
There is increased degradation and livestock grazing fields is decreasing and unable
to support livestock stock.  This has negatively impacted on the communities and
production systems resilience.  Therefore, various farm level strategies are required
to promote good rangeland management. These include:
3.10.1 Grazing management control:
This involves changing the control and regulation of grazing pressure through the
reduction of grazing intensity and reforestation (vegetation improvement). The
controls can be achieved through fencing, rotational grazing, ‘cut-and-carry’ of
fodder, and vegetation improvement.
3.10.2 Fodder substitution and fodder banks:
This can be achieved through:
•
Creation of fodder banks – areas delineated with fodder to be used in lean
times; harvesting and keeping fodder to be used later
•
Management of invasive species
•
Investing in alternative fodder like Cactus for livestock feed
•
Production of fodder under irrigation.
3.10.3 Livestock substitution:
This is the replacement of the large stock (e.g. cattle) with small stock to merge
carrying capacity or switching to camels which are more drought-resilient.
3.10.4 Management of crop and industrial residues:
These are investments in the production of livestock feeds to reduce pressure on the
natural feed sources. An example is the production of Multi Nutrient Blocks to fed
livestock during drought seasons

30
3.10.5 Contribution of livestock, pasture & rangeland management practices to
farm level resilience
•
The practice increases soil carbon which positively affects soil fertility and
overall rangeland production.
•
Through the improved grazing land management measures which leads to
increased fodder availability, farmers enhances livestock fodder sufficiency.
•
Through the collective management of community pastures, the practice
fosters social resilience thereby enhancing social cohesion.
3.11  Climate Information Services
As a result of unpredictable climatic pattern, farmers requires robust climate information
services to enable them make informed decisions. This includes information about past,
present and future climate scenarios, and their implications on farming enterprises,
livelihoods and environment.
3.11.1  Importance of climate information services
1.	 Increased understanding of climate change and related risks on agricultural
livelihoods.
2.	 Helps farmers make good choices of farm enterprises – seasonal and long-
term
3.	 Short-term national development planning e.g. to plan for subsidies and farm
inputs like irrigation water infrastructure.
4.	 Long-term national development planning e.g. decisions on agricultural
infrastructure like where to locate dams and water reservoirs for irrigation.
5.	 Pest and disease surveillance and early warning.
6.	 Development of appropriate adaptation and mitigation technologies
3.11.2 Contribution of climate services to farm level resilience
1.	 Adequate and timely weather information helps farmers make informed
decisions on the timing of agricultural activities for increased productivity
2.	 It enables farmers to manage the negative impacts of weather-induced risks in
the season while also taking advantage of good climatic seasons.
3.	 It helps agricultural actors to adjust their plans as climate stressors and shocks
unfold.
4.	 It provides information that supports mitigation (i.e. use of fertilizers) to
reduce emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming
3.12 Agricultural Insurance
Climate change and variability presents numerous social, economic and environmental
risks. At farm level, farmers face a number of risks ranging from production, produce

31
transportation and marketing that are linked to climate. Therefore, risk management
techniques, tools and policies are important to minimize adverse losses and develop
resilience to agricultural production systems.
Agricultural insurance practices are applicable to all sectors such as crops, livestock,
forestry, and aquaculture. Insurance allows a farmer to transfer a risk of an agricultural
loss in exchange for a premium to prevent a devastating loss.
3.12.1 Contribution of Agricultural Insurance to farm level resilience
a)	 It increases farmer willingness to adopt the climate-smart agricultural
technologies leading to increased productivity; food security and economic
gains.
b)	 Improves farmers access to credit for agricultural activities
c)	 Supports agricultural and rural development by helping farmers, financial
service providers and input suppliers cope with climatic risks.
d)	 It reduces the need for ad hoc disaster programmes which tend to be
expensive, ineffective, and inefficient.
e)	 By accessing credit, farmers take additional risks by investing in improved
practices that increases farm productivity and food security.

4  CEREALS
This section covers production, crop protection and post-harvest handling of three main
cereal crops namely; maize, sorghum and millets.
4.1  Maize
4.1.1  Agro-Ecological Requirements
Maize grows on a wide variety of soils, but performs best on well-drained, well-aerated,
deep warm and silt loamy soils with sufficient nutrients. Maize does not tolerate water
logging; it can wither if it stands in water for more than two days (Table 4.1)

The choice of appropriate maize varieties for a given location is very important
because every variety has extensively been tested and recommended based on
climatic conditions, yield potential, resistance to pests and diseases and maturity
period  (Figure 4.1) and Table 4.2.

b)  Germination test
Procedure for testing seed germination: Count 100 seeds of a selected maize
variety and put between moist old newspapers. After four days of incubation, the
germinated seeds are counted and divided by the total seeds and expressed as a
percentage. For example, if out of the 100 seeds 85 seeds germinated, germination
is ((85/100)*100)) 85%.
A germination of between 85% and 100% is considered good for the maize seed. In
case germination rate is lower, you may increase sowing density correspondingly
to ensure appropriate plant density for example plant 2-3 seeds per hole.

34
c)  Land Preparation
A maize farm can be prepared by hands, an ox plough, tractor and/or by spraying
with recommended herbicides.  It is important to prepare the land early enough to
allow weeds to dry and decompose.

f)  Weed management in cereals
•
Weeds reduce maize yields by competing for moisture, nutrients, space and
light. The most critical stage of weed competition in the life of a maize plant
is during the first four to six weeks after emergence of the crop. Some of the
recommended practices include:
o	 Hand weeding: Weed twice but the first weeding should be done 4 weeks
after emergence followed by a second weeding at knee high
o	 Use of herbicides: The recommended herbicides can be applied before
the crop emerges.
•
Other approaches include establishing a dense legume cover crop such as
lablab (Lablab purpureus), velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens) or sunhemp
(Crotalaria juncea) to suppress weeds.
•
Striga being a parasitic weed that grows by attaching itself to roots of a host
plant like maize and sorghum can be managed by using clean seeds and
equipment as well as striga resistant or tolerant maize varieties, in case they
are available. Legumes that are grown in rotation or as intercrops with maize
stimulate the germination of striga, but inhibit post-germination growth of the
weed because it cannot grow on the roots of legume crops. It is recommended
to use push and pull technology where fodder crops such as desmodium,
sesbania, crotalaria or fodder grasses like Napier grass for at least two
seasons until all striga is eliminated. Farmers can also apply ‘Kichawi Kill’
at 1-2 grams of the freshly prepared substrate in each maize planting hole to
arrest the striga seeds. However, farmers should regularly scout their fields
and uproot the Striga weeds early enough before they produce seeds.
g) Crop rotation
Practise crop rotation and avoid planting maize continuously. This is due to
challenges of diseases like the maize lethal necrosis disease. Some options will

36
include rotating with pulses like beans, cowpeas and peas. Avoid rotating with
cereal crops like sorghum and millet. Vegetables could be used for rotation
however, careful selection needs to be done to ensure that the hosts and vectors
are not same as for the maize diseases e.g. Aphids and thrips.
4.1.3  Crop Protection
Pests and diseases are a major constraint in maize production in Kenya that lead to
heavy yield losses and income for farmers and other value chain players Losses of 30
-100% have been reported due to maize diseases such as maize lethal necrosis disease
(MLND) and insect pests such as the fall army worm depending on the period the crop is
affected, incidences and severity of the problem. Hence the information provided in this
section aims at empowering farmers in pest & disease identification and management
to minimize losses

4.1.4 Post-Harvest Management And Handling
a)	 Harvesting green Maize
Maize that is to be eaten green is ready for
harvest when the grain starts hardening or
when the silky flowering at the top of the
maize cob turns black (Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.2: Green Maize cobs
ready for harvesting
b)	 Harvesting dried maize
Maize should be harvested at physiological maturity. However, maize can be left
in the field beyond physiological maturity to allow further drying. This can be
done through stooking for about 2 to 4 weeks.
c)	 Processing
i.  Shelling
Shelling should be done immediately after drying the cobs to reduce weevil
damage. Shelling of the grains should be done carefully, so that the grains do
not get damaged/break. Shelling can be done using a hand-held sheller. After
shelling, grains should be cleaned by removing any dirt, foreign matter, small
and damaged grains.
ii.  Drying
After harvesting, it is recommended that the maize should be dried to a
moisture content below 13%. Drying should not be carried out on the bare
ground, but on a cemented floor, on mats or tarpaulins (Figure 4.3) on a raised
structure like cribs or specially constructed drying sheds. This is to avoid the
grains picking up moisture, dirt and insects. In case of open air-drying, the
grain should be protected from rain, night dew, domestic animals and birds.
Maize laid on the ground for drying
Maize drying on a tarpaulin
Figure 4.3: Methods for drying maize before and after shelling
Salt method can be used to test if the maize is dry enough and with the
required moisture content. Use a clean, dry glass bottle of about 750 ml

41
capped. Grains are put into the bottle (which should be about one third full)
and 2–3 tablespoons (20–30g) of dry salt are added, shaken vigorously for
1 minute to mix the salt and grain, and then left for 15 minutes. If the salt
sticks to the side of the bottle, the moisture content of the grain is above 15%
and is not safe for storage. If the salt does not stick to the bottle, the moisture
content is below 15% and the grain is safe for storage.
iii.	 Storage
The dried and cleaned shelled grains should be stored in metallic silos (Figure
4.4) or packed in Hematic bags (Agro-Z bags) and stored well on pallets
in clean and well-ventilated stores. For farmers who do not have adequate
storage capacity, it is advisable to sell off the grain immediately to avoid
incurring losses.
Poor Maize storage condition
Sky plastic and small metal silos
Large scale metal silos
Figure 4.4: Maize storage methods
iv.  Marketing of grain
Efforts are geared towards produce aggregation and warehousing with an
to provide an organized marketing channel for farmers, to attract better
prices and leverage their stored grain to access credit. Formation of village
collection centres that are certified for warehouse receipting is important.
They serve as focal points for interaction of farmers and other stakeholders
as well.
4.1.5  Value Addition and Utilization
Maize has three possible uses: as food, feed for livestock, raw material for the industry
particularly manufacture of starch or may be dry milled into several intermediary
products including maize grits of different particle sizes and maize flour. These materials
in turn have applications in a large variety of foods including alcoholic beverages. The
most popular maize dish is “Githeri” (maize + bean).
Clean and well-dried maize grain is milled into flour and used to prepare porridge and
Ugali. Maize germ is used as a source of edible oil. Although the technology has been
available for a long time, the increase in fuel oil prices has resulted in much research
on the fermentation of maize to produce alcohol. Fermentation also provides some
alcoholic beverages.
4.2  Sorghum
Sorghum is a drought tolerant crop and is an important food and nutritional security
crop especially in semi-arid lands (SALs) of Kenya. It is a high-energy, nutritious food,

42
which is suitable for consumption by all. It is particularly recommended for children,
lactating mothers, convalescents and the elderly.

The choice of appropriate sorghum varieties is very important because of specific
attributes based on climatic conditions, yield potential, resistance to pests and
diseases, maturity period, household utilization and market preference (Table 4.8).

For best yields always endeavour to use certified seeds. However, as a last option
recycle seeds but for only three seasons. Grow only one variety in the same field
for parity. The following steps are essential in seed selection;
1)	 Identify healthy plants with large panicles in the middle of the crop field.
2)	 Tag the identified plants.
3)	 Harvest them separately before harvesting the rest of the crop
4)	 Sun dry to the recommended moisture content (12%).
5)	 Discard the tip of the panicle to avoid small malformed grains.
6)	 Thresh and sort the seed to remove the broken, damaged or shriveled seed
7)	 Dress the seeds with chemical products like Thiram, Marshall, Poncho
FS 600 and Cruiser 350 FC at the recommended rates. Mix the seeds
thoroughly with the chemical
b)	 Germination test
Test seeds before planting to determine their viability. The seed testing steps are:
i.
Select a site near the homestead where there is access to water.
ii.	 Prepare a 1m by 1 m seedbed and make 100 planting stations (10 by 10
cm).
iii.	 Plant 100 seeds and cover with soil. Water adequately for seven days.
iv.	 Take first germination count after 5 days and the final count at seven days.
v.	 85% germination count is considered adequate for sorghum.
i)
Land preparation
Prepare fields well in advance. It is recommended that land be ploughed
immediately after harvesting the previous crop. Sorghum seeds are small in
size and require a fine seedbed for better seedling establishment. If tractor or
oxen plough is used to open up the field, it is advisable to harrow it once in
order to break the large soil boulders (Figure. 4.5a). When hand-hoes are used
for land preparation, the large soil boulders should be reduced by breaking
them to provide a moderately smooth seed bed (Fig. 4.5b).
Figure 4.5a:  Poor seed bed
Figure 4.5b: Good seed bed

44
ii)	 Soil fertility management
At planting apply one bag (50kg) per acre of compound fertilizer NPK
(20:20:0, 23:23:0 or 17: 17:17). Top dress with one bag (50kg) of calcium
ammonium nitrate (CAN) per acre preferably after first weeding.
Drill the fertilizer along the planting furrows and thoroughly mixed with the
soil before planting and covering the seed. Manure improves soil organic
matter which impacts positively on soil moisture retention and structure.
Broadcast well-decomposed manure in the field close to the onset of the rains
at a rate of 2 tons per acre and mix it with the soil during ploughing. Manure
can also be spread in bands along the planting furrows and mixed with the
soil before seeds are sown.
iii)	 Planting
Dry planting is highly recommended. Plant before or at the onset of rains by
either drilling seeds in the furrows made by oxen plough, tractor, or hill plant
in holes made by hoe (Jembe) or Panga.
Plant at a depth of 2.5 cm to 4.0 cm when soil is moist (after onset of rains)
and 5 cm when dry planting. If planting is done when soil is moist press the
soil to get in good contact with the seeds.
Use the recommended spacing and seed rates as indicated in Table 4.9 and
Figs. 4.6a & b.

iv)
Weeding
Weeding should be done within 2-3 weeks after emergence. The second
weeding depends on the rainfall and weed density.

45
v)	 Thinning and rogueing
Thinning is best done around 3 weeks after emergence after first weeding.
Thin when the soil is moist to minimize disturbance of the roots of the
remaining plants to leave one plant per hole. Leave 2 plants adjacent to a gap
to compensate for a missing plant within the row. To achieve good yields, the
vegetative regrowth (tillers) ensure 2-3 plants per stool.
Remove plants that are diseased or has characteristics which are different
from the others. For example, plants that are taller than the general height of
the other plant population or those whose head or grain colour is different.
vi)	 Crop rotation
Crop rotation is highly recommended to reduce build-up of sorghum diseases
and insect pests. Avoid rotating of sorghum with other cereal crops like maize
and millet.
4.2.3  Crop Protection
Pests and diseases management
Integrated pest and disease management is recommended. Some examples of common
sorghum diseases and pests and their control measures are shown in Tables 4.19 and
4.11, respectively.
Table 4.10: Important diseases and their control
Diseases
Symptoms
Control Measures
Anthracnose
Anthracnose damages foliage and stems
of grain sorghum. Dry lesions appear on
the leaf surface. A brown sunken area
with distinct margins develops appears
on the stem holding the head (peduncle).
When infected stems are cut lengthwise
they have brick-red discolorations.
The infection inhibits the flow of water
and nutrients to the grain causing poor
development.
• Plant resistant/tolerant varieties
• Rotate with non-cereals
preferably with pulses.
• Good management of crop
residues.
Leaf blight
Small reddish-purple or yellowish-brown
spots on the leaves. Severely affected
plants look as if they have been burnt.
Under warm, humid conditions the disease
may cause serious damage by killing all
leaves before plants have matured.
• Plant resistant varieties
• Use certified disease-free seeds.
• Good management of crop
residues.
Leaf rust
Small raised pustules or blisters on both
the upper and lower leaf surfaces that
rupture and release many reddish-brown
spores. Appears when plants nearly
flowering. Forage yields are affected most.
Grain yield losses are usually not serious.
• Use resistant varieties such as
KARI Mtama 1
• Rotate with non-cereals.
• Control weeds

46
Diseases
Symptoms
Control Measures
Long smut
The spores are seed borne and germinate
soon after the seed is planted and invades
the young sorghum plant. It continues
to grow unobserved until heading stage,
when the long pointed smut galls appear
in the heads in place of normal grains.
Unlike covered smut, this disease stunts
the infected plants and often induces
abundant side branches.
• Certified disease-free seeds.
• Control weeds.
• Rotation with non-cereals.
• Field sanitation.
Covered smut
Black masses of powdery spores instead
of grains; the entire head becomes
black. Plants become infected while in
the seedling stage but infection is not
apparent until heading stage. The smut
gall produces thousands of spores, which
become soil-borne and initiate systemic
infection of seedlings in subsequent years.
• Plant resistant hybrids to avoid
losses.
• Use certified disease-free seed.
• Rotate with non-cereals.
• Plough deep.
Ergot
Dark brown to black sclerotia develop in
place of seeds on the panicle. The spores
are carried by insects or splashed by rain
to infect flowers, where they invade the
young kernels and replace them with
fungal growth. The spores are also seed
borne and soil borne but the damage
becomes apparent when they reach
flowering stage.
•
Plant resistant varieties,
•
Remove affected panicles.
•
Plant clean seeds.
•
Plough deep.
•
Rotate with non-cereals
•
Good field sanitation
Table 4.11: Sorghum pests
Pest
Symptoms

Shootfly
The yellowish or white maggots bores into
the hearts of the shoot causing drying of
the central growing shoot (dead heart)
• Early uniform planting
• Spray with systemic
insecticide like Actara,
• Seed dress with systemic
insecticide such as Bellamid
600 FS at 3g/1Kg seed
Stalk borers
Caterpillar feed inside the stalks causing a
stunted plant growth, windowing of leaves,
withered shoots and often and poorly
developed heads
• Plant early into the season
• Field sanitation
• Apply insecticide into the
funnels such as Bulldock,
Dipterex, Thiodan
• Practice Push Pull technology
by intercropping with
desmodium and napier round
the edge of the farm
Birds
Birds are one of the most important pests
of sorghum. They are capable of causing
heavy losses. The most notorious species
is Quelea
• Use bird scaring device
• Destroy their roosting sites
• Avoid isolated fields
• Timely harvesting

47
Post-Harvest Management and Handling
Harvest sorghum when it has reached physiological maturity (when the grain is hard
and does not produce milk when crushed) by cutting the heads with sickles or sharp
knife.
i.   Sorghum Ratooning
•
Ratooning is a practice of getting more than one crop (tillers) from a single
sowing through proper crop husbandry.
•
Cut back the plants immediately after harvesting to about three inches above
the ground to allow vegetative regrowth in the following rain season.
•
The well-established root system of the ratoon crop has the ability to utilize
the environmental resources better than a freshly sown crop. It reduces
labour requirements by minimizing costs such as ploughing, planting and
bird scaring associated with migratory birds at off seasons.
ii.	 Drying and storage
•
Sun dry or use a dryer to dry the harvested panicles to moisture content of
12 to13% to avoid fungal growth which can lead to aflatoxin accumulation.
Avoid drying sorghum grain in field to reduce the risk of yield losses due to
pests, especially birds
•
Sorghum may be stored as unthreshed panicles or threshed grain.
•
Panicles can be threshed on mats to maintain qualityby beating on a
threshing rack, tarpaulins or by using a mechanised thresher.
•
Threshed grain is thinly spread on plastic tarpaulins, mats, plastic sheets or
raised wire mesh trays  to allow air to pass through it and turn  it regularly to
ensure proper drying before storage
•
Winnow and sort the dry grains to remove chaff, dust, foreign matter such
as stones, broken, shrivelled, mouldy, insect damaged, rotten, discoloured or
faded grains, and any remaining plant parts (leaves and stalks)
•
Dust the panicles or grain with storage chemicals like Actellic or Actellic at
rate 50g/90kg grains
•
Store in a clean store, hermetic bags or metal silos.
•
If grain is kept for more than 90 days especially in hot areas, a second
dusting is recommended after 3 months to protect it during storage pest
•
Use a secured storage system to protect the seed from damage caused by
insects, fungi and rodents.
4.2.5  Value Addition and Utilization
Sorghum grain can be utilized either as whole or dehulled and processed further to
give various products (sorghum pilau, sorghum cookies and cakes, uji, ugali and many
others).

48
4.3  Millet
Millets are a group of cereals grown in semi-arid regions. They include pearl millet,
finger millet, foxtail millet and Proso millet. They have a short growing season, can
withstand high-temperatures and escape drought. They are cultivated as human food or
as fodder for animals. The Government of Kenya has put more emphasis on production
of millet to mitigate food safety and nutritional security.

i.   Variety selection
Choice of appropriate millet varieties is very important because every variety
has extensively been tested and recommended based on climatic conditions,
yield potential, resistance to pests and diseases, maturity period and household
utilization and market preferences.(Table 4.13).
Certified seeds of improved varieties are recommended. Farmers can also select
and save seeds from the harvest and replant them for 3 seasons before buying
certified seed once more.
These steps are essential when farmers are selecting their own seed.
•
Identify disease and pest free plants in the field.
•
Select plants with large panicles and preferably in the middle of crop field.
•
Tag the identified plants.
•
Harvest them separately before harvesting the rest of the crop.
•
Sun dry to the recommended moisture content (12%).
•
Discard the tip of the panicle to avoid small malformed grains.
•
Thresh and clean the seed before treatment.
•
Store seeds in a cool dry environment.
•
Dress the seed with Apron star, Poncho FS 600, Cruiser FS 350

For a recommended plant density to be achieved during planting, a simple
germination test of owned saved seeds help in determining the viability of the
seed before planting. The testing steps are:
•
Select a site near the homestead where there is access to water.
•
Prepare 1m by 1 m seedbed and make 100 planting holes spaced at10cm by
10 cm.
•
Plant a 100 seed and cover with soil and water adequately for seven days.
•
Take first germination count after 3 days and the final after seven days.
•
85% germination count is considered adequate for millet.
•
Select seeds with good vigour (Figure 4.7).
Figure 4.7: Normal seedlings with vigour
ii.  Land preparation
Millet is a small seeded crop and therefore requires a fine seedbed for good seed
germination and seedling establishment. A tractor or oxen plough can be used to
open the field, harrow to break the large soil boulders (Figure 4.8a). When hand-
hoes are used for land preparation, the large soil boulders should be reduced by
breaking them to provide a moderately smooth seed bed (Fig.4.8b). Select fields
not far from homesteads and avoid birds breeding sites.

50
Figure 4.8a: Poor seedbed
Figure 4.8b: Ideal seedbed
iii.  Soil Fertility Management
During planting, it is recommended to apply NPK (20:20:0 or 23:23:0) at a rate of
one bag (50kgs) per acre. In soils with low fertility and in instances where rainfall
continues beyond 30 days after planting, top dress with CAN at a rate of one bag
(50 Kgs) per acre. Apply fertilizer along the furrows and thoroughly mix with soil
before placing the seeds.
One can also apply manure to improve nutrients, structure and increases moisture
retention capacity level in the soil. Only use well-decomposed manure by
broadcasting in the field close to the onset of the rains and mix with the soil during
ploughing. In case of low volumes of manure, it can be spread in bands along the
planting furrows and mixed with the soil before seeds are placed (Figures 4.9a and
4.9b). Application of farmyard manure at 5 tons acre is recommended.
Figure 4.9a: Manure banded in rows
Figure 4.9b: Mixing manure with soil
iv.  Planting
The spacing for planting furrows depends on; the variety being used and whether
it is a sole or intercrop. However, for optimum plant density a spacing of 90
cm between row and 20 cm between plants is recommended (Figures 4.10a and
4.10b). The recommended planting depth is 5 cm on dry soils, and 2 and/or 4 cm
on wet soils. Seed rates
Pearl millet - 2 kg/acre
Finger millet - 1.2 kg/acre
Proso millet - 1.6 kg/acre
Fox millet - 1.6 kg/acre

51
Figure 4.10a: Furrows made by ox-plough
Figure 4.10b: Manual planting
Millet can be intercropped with pulses such as pigeon peas and green grams. The row
arrangement for the cereal and legume could be a single alternate where a legume falls
between two rows, or rows of millet spaced at 60 cm (Fig. 4.11). Two rows of pulses
could also be alternated with two rows of millet.
Figure 4.11: Pearl millet-legume intercrop
Figure 4.12: Weeding
v.  Weeding and Thinning Stages
•
The first weeding should be done within 2-3 weeks after emergence (Figure
4.12) and second weeding is recommended depending on the weed density.
Chemical weeding can also be done using pre-emergence herbicides.
•
Thinning should be done when the soil is moist to ensure minimal
disturbance of the roots of the remaining plants for a healthy growth.
Thinning should be done 3 weeks after emergence (at 3-4th leaf stage
and leave 1 plant per hole. This is best done after first weeding in order
to accommodate appropriate plant density adjustments, and leaving two
plants adjacent to it compensates for a gap within the row.
•
Uproot plants that display abnormal characteristics like being taller than
other plants, if the flower colour deviates from the majority of other plants,
or grain colour that is different from that of majority of plants.

4.3.4  Harvesting and Post-Harvest Handling
Heads are harvested manually by cutting with knives at physiological maturity and sun-
dried before threshing and drying to 12-13% moisture content. Threshing and sorting
of the dry grain can be dusted with Actellic or Actellic for protection against storage
pests. If the grain is meant for seed, then it should be dressed with Bellamid 600 FS or
Gaucho FS 350 for protection against soil pests.
The grain should be kept in either metal or plastic containers. When sisal bags are used,
they should be kept in a cool, dry and well-ventilated place. If grain is kept for more
than 90 days especially in hot areas, a second dusting is recommended after 3 months.
4.3.5  Value Addition and Utilization
Millet is a high-energy nutritious cereal. It is particularly recommended for children,
lactating mothers, convalescents and the elderly. Some of the healthy benefits of millet
includes; prevention of cancer, help management of diabetes, offer a dietary option
for people with Celiac disease, improve digestive health, build strong bones, promote
red blood cell development, and boost energy and fuel production. Pearl millet is
traditionally used for making a variety of foods including thin porridge, “Ugali” and
local brew.

5.1.2  Agronomic Practices
i.   Variety Selection
For successful production, it is important that high-quality seed be used. Using
disease-free seed reduces the incidence of seed-borne diseases.
Use of certified seed is preferable, however, a farmer may select from his bean
harvest. This should be done carefully ensuring all wrinkled, damaged and
diseased seeds are removed. Bean seed bought from shops or markets may have
been damaged by insects, or may be rotten, broken or mouldy. Beans should be
well sorted and only the best be used for planting. Good quality bean seed has the
following properties:
•
pure: all seeds are of the same variety and  size;
•
clean:  not mixed with foreign matter such as stones or dirt, or other seeds;
•
not damaged: broken, shriveled, mouldy, or insect damaged;

not rotten, not discoloured or faded ; may be diseased.
Selected seeds must be dressed with insecticides such as Aldrin 2.5% at 5g/kg seed
or thiram or Fenasan D at the rate of 3g per kg of seed against pests and fungal
diseases. Once the seeds is treated, it should not be used for human consumption
and should be planted immediately.
Always test your/cycled seed for germination before it is planted. Take samples of
seeds (a handful) place them between moist newspapers for five days. If 90% (9
out of 10) germinate the seeds are good, if less than 80% (8/10) germinate plant
two seeds per hole instead of one. If less than 40% (4/10) germinate discard the
seeds.

ii.  Land Preparation
To realize high yields, select highly productive land. Always avoid steeply sloping
land which is near a swamp, areas with shallow surface sandy soils with a lot of
couch grass. Land preparation should be done early to remove weeds and ready

55
for planting at the onset of rains. Seed bed should have fine soils and leveled to
facilitate planting at uniform depth and uniform distribution of water.
iii.  Soil Fertility Management
Use 15-20 tons/ha of farm yard manure especially in areas where soils are low
in organic matter content. Well decomposed animal manure or compost should
be applied under dry conditions and then mixed with the top soil. This should be
done about one week prior to planting.
One can also use 80kg DAP or 23:23:0, or Mavuno per acre. The fertilizer should
be thoroughly mixed with soil before covering the seed. It is recommended to
artificially inoculate the seeds with an appropriate strain of Rhizobium to increase
nitrogen fixation. Dissolve 60g of molasses thoroughly in half-litre of water and
add a packet of the culture is mixed so as to form slurry.  Mix 10kg seed (free from
dust) thoroughly with the slurry of the culture taking care that all the seeds are
equally coated with the product. Spread the coated seed on a polythene sheet or a
clean cloth in the shade and allowed them to dry.  Plant the dried seed immediately.
Always check the expiry date of the culture (inoculum). Store the inoculum in
the refrigerator (do not freeze). Do not mix the inoculum with either pesticide or
fertilizer.
iv.  Planting
Beans should be planted at the onset of rains since heavy rain may lead to soil crusting
and restrict seedling emergence. Delay in
planting may result in reduced yields or crop
failure.
In mono cropping (beans alone) plant at
spacing of 50 cm x 10 cm (one seed per hole
within a depth of 2.5 to 5.0 cm below the soil
surface (Figure 5.1). If weeding will be done
by animal use 60 cm spacing.
In intercropping with maize, plant maize
at the recommended spacing for the agro-
ecological zone. Interplant two bean rows
between the maize rows at 15 cm within the row, one seed per hole. The other
alternative is to have one bean row between maize rows and two seeds per hole.
The amount of seed required for a given area vary from variety to variety
depending on the size of the seed. The bigger the seed size the more the seed
quantity required. It ranges between 16-25kg/acre.
v.  Weeding
Keep your bean field free from weeds. Timely and thorough weeding is absolutely
essential. This is achieved by a first weeding at 2-3 weeks after emergence followed
by a second weeding 3 weeks later (just before flowering) in mono-cropping.
Figure 5.1: Bean planted under monocrop

56
In case of intercrop, one weeding 3 weeks after planting may be sufficient except
in high rainfall areas where a second weeding 3 weeks after the 1st weeding may
be necessary. Care should be taken to avoid damaging the shallow roots especially
during the first weeding. Avoid weeding during flowering time to avoid flower
shedding and when the field is wet to avoid spread of diseases and soil compaction.
Where the use of herbicide is economically feasible, apply Lasso 4 E-C (Alachlor)
– 3 liters product in 160 litres of water per hectare pre-emergence and when the soil
is moist, or Galex (metabromuron + metolachlor) 6.0 litres product in 160 Iitres of
water per acre. Other pre-emergent herbicides are Stomp (Pendimicthalira) at 1.0
litres per acre and Linuron. Basagran (Bentazons) can be applied post - emergent
at 1.0–1.2 litres per hectare in both pure and mixed cropping to control broad
leaved weeds.
vi.  Crop Rotation
This practice is recommended to avoid pest and disease build up. Rotation is
mainly done with cassava, maize, sorghum or any other non leguminaceae family
member crop.

5.1.4  Post-Harvest Management and Handling
Harvest the beans when all the pods have turned yellow and before they become so dry
that the pods begin to shatter or rot away. Dry beans should have a moisture content of
about 50% at physiological maturity. However, beans are ready for harvesting when the
moisture content drops to 16%.
If dry beans have not attained 16% moisture content, sun dry them before threshing.
Test the moisture of the seed before threshing using your teeth or pinching with your
Fingers. Avoid threshing immediately after harvesting this can damage the seed because
it is too moist. Threshing on the ground or in a gunny bag can easily damage the seed.
Threshing on a threshing rack protects the seed from damage and dirt and prevents it
from scattering. Broken or cracked seed is likely to be attacked by insects and fungi.

60
After the seed has been threshed, dry again to about 10% moisture content. If the
moisture is still high, dry the grains on mats, or wire mesh trays raised on a platform.
Spread the seed thinly on the drying surface to allow air to pass through it. Turn the seed
regularly to avoid overheating.
Winnow the dried grains to remove chaff. Sort to remove foreign matter such as stones
and all grains that are broken, shriveled, mouldy, insect damaged, rotten, discoloured or
faded.
Make sure the store is well ventilated. Clean and dust with Malathion 25% at 400gms
in 5 litres of water for every 100 m2 before storing your beans. Bruchids are major
storage pests, dust beans with Actellic  (50g per bag) before storage. Beans intended for
consumption should be treated with Actellic or 2% Malathion dust at the rate of 50g per
bag of 90kg or sunflower or maize oil at 200ml per bag. The beans can also be stored in
air-tight bins or drum or well secured gunny bags.
Beans for planting should be treated with Fernason D (contains) Linclance Thiran) at
3g/kg seed or Aldrin 2.5% at 5g/kg seed.
5.1.5  Value Addition and Utilization
The seeds are utilized in various ways which include boiling pure beans mixed with
other grains to make the following dishes;
•
Boiling beans with maize mixture to soft (Githeri)
•
Boiling beans with maize mashing with potato and greens (mukimo)
•
Boiling beans alone and mashing with sweet potato (mushenye)
•
Boiling beans alone with testa or without and marsh or not and used to eat with
Ugali, and cooked rice
•
Pre-cooking plus tomato sauce and canned (bean variety Mexican 142)
5.2  Green Grams
Green grams also known as Mung beans and in Kiswahili Ndengu are well suited to
diverse environments and fit in various cropping systems, low input requirements, fast
growth, nitrogen fixing and weed smothering ability. They are commonly grown in
central, south Nyanza, eastern and coastal regions. Its edible grain is characterized by
good digestibility, flavor, high and easily digestible protein content and absence of any
flatulence effects. It’s also a crucial source of vitamins A and B, micro-nutrients such as
iron and zinc which are good for pregnant women and children.

There are two major varieties that can be differentiated through the grain colour.
These are the yellow and the green grain grams. The N26 green gram variety is
small and ripens unevenly while the improved variety KS20 has bigger seeds and
tends to ripen uniformly (Table 5.5).

b.  Germination test
Farmers are advisable to conduct a simple germination test by taking a few seeds
of the green grams (e.g. a table spoonful), soak them in water overnight and wrap
them in a moist cotton cloth or old newspaper. Water them 3 times a day and exam
the number of sprouted seeds on the 3rd day. Count the number of seeds that sprout
and divide by the total number of seeds. If the germination is 60% (6/10), plant
3-4 seeds per hole while, if 90% (9/10) germination, plant 2 seeds per hole.
c.  Site selection
In order to realize good yields, avoid steep sloppy land, swampy fields, heavy
clays and fields with a lot of couch grass.  It is important to look for high soil
fertility indicators and also fields where green grams have been grown for not
more than two seasons. Crop rotation should be practiced using non-leguminous
crops like maize, sorghum, millet and cassava.
d.  Land Preparation
To realize high yields, select highly productive land suitable. Always avoid
steeply sloping land, land which is near a swamp, very sandy soil and areas with
shallow surface soil and a lot of couch grass.  Land preparation should be done
early enough so that the field is free of weeds and ready for planting at the onset
of rains. Seed bed should have fine soils. A level seedbed facilitates planting to a
uniform depth and uniform distribution of water
e.  Improving soil fertility
It is advisable to use fertilizers on the basis of soil test and recommendations, a
basal dose of NPK (23:23:0) 1 bag (50Kgs)/ acre may be broadcasted. Nitrogen
fertilizer is usually not applied as green grams fix their own nitrogen, but 10-20
tons (100 wheel barrows) per acre farm yard manure can be applied. The manure
should be broadcasted just before rains start and ploughed in. Fertilizer should be
well mixed with the soil before placing the seed. Lime should be applied one year
prior to growing green grams and thoroughly incorporated
f.  Planting, spacing and seed rate
Seeds for planting should obtained from a known source and should be clean
and of good quality. For local varieties a source with good quality seed should be
sought.
Plant seeds 3-5cm deep in a well-prepared seedbed with good moisture content.
If the surface layers are dry, increase the depth to 7.5 cm but only if the soils do
not crust easily. When using oxen plough for planting, place the seed at the side
of the furrow.
Green grams can be planted as a single crop or intercropped with other crops like
sorghum. When planted alone, the spacing should be at 45cm (1.5ft) between
rows and 15cm (0.5ft) between plants (Figure 6.2). In intercropping, the green
gram rows are planted in the middle of the accompanying crop and the intra row
spacing is maintained at 15cm.  Plant 4-5kg/acre or 2‘gorogoro’ per acre.

63
Figure 5.2: Spacing of green grams
g.  Weeding:
Weed control in green grams is essential, to reduce competition for nutrients
which result to low yields. Weed-free crop of green grams decreases insect pest
infestation. The most common weeding method is hand weeding but oxen can
be used too. The first weeding should be done 2 weeks after emergence and the
second before flowering.
h.  Crop Rotation
Green grams in a mono cropping system should be rotated with non-leguminous
crops such as maize, millet, sorghum, sweet potatoes and cassava. This practice is
recommended to avoid pest and disease build up. It is not advisable to grow mug
beans for two consecutive seasons on the same field. Mug beans leave a nitrogen-
rich soil allowing subsequent crops to benefit and grow successfully.
5.2.3  Crop Protection
Losses of up to 10-45% in green grams have been associated with common blight while
80% due to angular leaf spot disease. Therefore, pests and disease management is very
important for high grain yield and quality. The major pests and diseases for green grams
are indicated in Table 5.7.

• Spray with cabendazim
(Bendazim 500SC) or
Azoxystrobin (Target Top 325)
SC respectively
5.2.4  Post Harvest Management and Handling
Harvesting should take place when most of the pods have turned black. Pods should
be picked individually or whole plants by uprooting before they start shattering in the
field. Dry the pods for about 2 to 5 days before threshing to avoid grain damage due to
high seed moisture content. Mechanical harvesting can also be done in order to save
on labour costs.
i)
Threshing
Before you start threshing test the moisture by crushing a few grains with the
teeth or pinching with fingers. If the seed is easily crushed, the moisture is still too
high and the harvests should be dried further. Threshing can be done using either
mechanical or by biting. Use a stick to hit the pods either placed on a tarpaulin
or inside a bag to avoid dirt and foreign materials. For the mechanical method,
a thresher can be used which makes work easier and faster. Spread the threshed
grains on a raised cement platform or tarpaulin to dry.

66
ii)	 Winnowing and sorting
Sorting and winnowing is the process
of removing foreign material from
the threshed grain. This can be done
by either picking the broken/rotten/
deformed grains or by scooping the
grain and subjecting it to wind action
(winnowing) (Figure 5.3). The grain
drops to the ground while the chaff
or foreign material is blown away.
Figure 5.3: Winnowing process
iii)	 Drying
Dry the winnowed grain to 12% moisture content before storage.
iv)	  Storage
Clean he grain bins/silos and fumigate to control bruchids. Make sure the store
is well aerated, leak proof and damp proof. Dust the grains using different
recommended chemicals such as Actellic at a rate of 50gm per 90 kg bag. Make
sure the storage bins, silos or hermetic bags are airtight.
5.2.5  Value Addition and UTILIZATION
The grains are utilized in variable ways such as;
•
Boiling as stew which can be served hot with rice, chapatti, Ugali, cassava or
sweet potatoes
•
Green grams sprouts that can be consumed directly with lemon and salt as a
healthy snack or added to salad
•
Green grams flour for preparing soups, porridge, snacks, bread and noodles.z

b. Seed treatment
Seed treatment plays an important role in protecting the seeds and seedlings from
seed, soil borne diseases and insect pests affecting crop emergence and its growth.
Seed-borne diseases result in poor germination, poor plant vigour, low yield and
poor quality seed. The seed is dressed with either a dry formulation or wet treated
with a slurry or liquid formulation.
c.  Germination test
The results of the test inform the farmers how much seed they need to plant per
given acreage to get good yields.  To calculate the germination percentage, a
random sample of 100 seeds is taken from the seed lot. They are placed on moist
newspaper and covered with another piece of moist newspaper.  The seeds should
be kept moist, but not wet. Seedlings should begin to emerge 7-11 days after
planting. The germination percentage is calculated by counting the number of
seeds that have germinated and dividing this by the number of seeds that were
planted. Then multiply this number by 100.
d.  	 Site selection
To ensure high pigeon pea yields, one needs to select highly productive land
suitable for pigeon pea production and avoid steeply sloping land, which is near
a swamp, or very sandy soil or areas with shallow surface soil with a lot of couch
grass. Areas that indicate high soil fertility are the best.
e.  Land Preparation
Land preparation should be done as early as possible to ensure early planting.
Pigeon peas require a medium tilth and soils with huge soil clods should be
avoided.
f.   	Improving soil fertility
Although pigeon pea is a nitrogen fixing species, fertilizer is recommended at
levels of 9-11kg/acres(20–25 kg/ha) N. Phosphorus is the most limiting factor for
pigeon pea and a basal application of one 50kg bag / acre of NPK fertilizer (either
20:20:0 or 23:23:0) should be applied at planting. To enhance nitrogen fixation
the seeds can be inoculated with Rhizobium. Pigeon pea can be used as a green
manure crop.

69
g.	 Planting
In most cases pigeon pea is grown as an intercrop with cereals (maize, sorghum
and millets) or other legumes, which are harvested to avoid competition before
flowering and seed set. Pigeon pea does best when broadcast and covered or
drilled into a well-prepared seedbed at a depth of 2.5–10 cm. Early planting is
recommended. Seedlings are difficult to transplant.
Seed rate: 10 kg/ha (4 Kg/acre)
Spacing: Sole cropping
Mbaazi 1 (ICPL 87091) - Sow at 50 cm between rows and 10 cm between plants
if using plough, skip one furrow.
Kat 60/8 - Plant 75 cm between rows and 50cm between plants. When using oxen
for ploughing and planting sow after every other two furrows.
Mbaazi 2 (ICEAP 00040) - Plant 100 cm between the rows and 50 cm between
plants at lower altitudes where temperature are warmer. At higher altitudes these
spacing’s should be reduced by 20-30 cm.
Local varieties – Plant at 120 cm between rows and 60 cm between plants.
h.	 Intercropping
Kat 60/8 and Mbaazi 2 can be intercropped with maize, sorghum or millet
during the first season which is normally the short rains (October-December). If
intercropped with maize, sow either one row of pigeon pea after one row of maize
or one row of pigeon pea followed by two rows of maize at a distance of 90cm
between maize and sorghum and pigeon pea rows. Mbaazi 1 should always be
planted as a pure stand.
i.
Weeding
Seedlings emerge 2–3 weeks after sowing.  The initial growth is slow until
the taproot develops. The plant is very sensitive to weed competition in the
early growth stage and it is important to keep the crop weed free in the first
45 to 60 days of growth. Effective weed control at the early growth stages
of the crop is one of the most important factors contributing to high yields.
The first weeding of all varieties must be done within the first 2-3 weeks
after germination whereas subsequent weedings will depend on the growth of
weeds and amount of rainfall.
5.3.3  Crop Protection
a)	 Pests and diseases control
Insect pests and diseases have negative impact on pigeon pea productivity; also
leading to poor quality seed. Pests and diseases reduce the plant stand; however,
these can be controlled by the use of pest and disease resistant cultivars, crop
rotations, weed removal, inoculation with the cowpea group strain of Rhizobium
and intercropping with cereals.

70
Common Insect Pests
Aphids, thrips, pod fly, pod sucking bugs, pod borers and bruchids are major
pigeon pea pests. Mbaazi-1 and KAT 60/8 flowering normally coinciding with
peak periods of the insect pests infestations. Different insect pests are best
controlled in the following stages:
Before flowering - Thrips and aphids
After flowering - Pod fly, pod borers, pod sucking bugs
Storage - Bruchids
General recommendation - spray once before flowering and twice after flowering.
Table 5.11 summarises the most common insect pests and their management.

5.3.4  Post Harvesting Management and Handling
a)   Harvesting:
Harvest dry grains when most of the pods are dry and have turned brown. Harvesting
is done by hand picking individual pods or cutting the bearing branches. Farmers
use human labour or domestic animals to transport and thresh the harvest.
Harvesting ground is not usually covered with canvas in most cases and the grain
collects a lot of dust and dirt, and at times gets mixed up with animal dung and
urine. Therefore, winnowing and sorting is necessary to remove foreign materials.
Sorting is also done to remove stones.
b)	 Threshing
Carried out using either mechanical or manual methods. For mechanical method,
a thresher can be used to makes work easier and faster but for manual threshing
sticks are used to hit the pods either placed on a tarpaulin or inside a bag. To avoid
dirt and foreign materials, the threshed seeds should be spread on polythene paper
c) Winnowing and sorting
Winnowing is the process of removing foreign material from the threshed grain
and this is achieved by use of winnowing trays (‘uteo’) or by scooping the grain
and subjecting it to wind action. The grain drops to the ground while the chaff

72
or foreign material is blown away. Sorting is the process of removing foreign
material from the threshed grain. This can be done by either picking the broken/
rotten/deformed grains.
d) Grain dressing and storage:
Grains should be stored when thoroughly dried (13% Moisture content or less),
dressed with neem leaves or treated with wood ash (4-6 kg per 90 kg bag) or
Actellic (50g per 90 kg bag) if stored for longer period. The grains can also be
kept in airtight drums or in hermetic bags. However, if seeds are to be used for
planting, they should not be stored in airtight containers so as to maintain viability
however gunny bags are recommended.
5.3.5  Value Addition and Utilization
Pigeon peas provide both human food as well as livestock feed. It is an excellent source
of dietary protein. It can be consumed in form of whole grain or split (dehulled). It is
also eaten as a vegetable (immature pods or green pea) or a dried grain (cooked and
eaten as dhal (dry split cotyledons).
The dry peas may be sprouted briefly, and then cooked, for a flavour different from the
green or dry peas. Sprouting enhances digestibility of dried pigeon peas by reduction
of indigestible sugars that would otherwise remain in cooked dried peas. Pigeon peas
leaves and husks provide livestock feed.
Pigeon peas are also useful as tall hedges on dry soils and on the bunds of paddy fields.
The branches and stems can be used for baskets and firewood. It is often grown as shade
crop, cover crop or windbreak.
5.4  Cowpea
Cowpea is an important grain legume in the farming systems of Kenya since it is a
major source of dietary protein and income for the people. It also known to improve
soil fertility, suppressing weeds, supply of vegetables and dry grain after maturity. It is
usually grown as an intercrop with maize, sorghum, millet and/or cassava. It is mainly
grown in Western, lower eastern, Coast and Nyanza regions for vegetables, grain and
animal feed. However, 85% of total area under cowpea production in the eastern region
of Kenya as an intercrop with maize and or cassava.

b)   Germination test
It is advisable to conduct a simple germination test for cowpeas seeds before
planting;
•
Take a few seeds of cowpeas (e.g. a table spoonful) and soak them in water
overnight.
•
Wrap the soaked seeds in moist cotton clothing or new paper.
•
Keep the cloth/paper moist by watering 3 times a day.
•
Examine sprouted seeds on the third day. If at least 90%( 9/10) seeds have
emerged, then it is good for planting. If less than 60% (6/10) emerge get
new seeds as it will result to poor establishment.
c)	 Site selection
To ensure high cowpeas production, avoid steeply sloping area, land that is near
a swamp, or very sandy soil, areas with shallow surface soil and a lot of couch
grass. Planting on fields that had a leguminous crop previously should also be
avoided to reduce pests and diseases. Crop rotation is encouraged with maize,
sorghum and millet.
d)	 Land Preparation
Land preparation should be done early enough so that the field is free from weeds
and ready for planting at the onset of rains. The seedbed should have fine tilth,
to suppress weed growth and enhance moisture retention, easy germination and
root penetration. The land must be ploughed and harrowed after clearing and all
the debris removed. The ground must be deep, level and firm because this ensures
better surface contact between the seed and the soil, increasing the absorption of
moisture.
e)	 Soil Fertility
Organic fertilizers
As a legume, cowpea fixes its own nitrogen. Too much fertilizer will push leafy
growth and reduce grain production. The use of at least 2.5 tons/acre of farmyard
manure is especially in areas where soils are low in organic matter content. Well-
decomposed animal manure or compost should be applied under dry conditions,
and then mixed with the soil at ploughing or planting.
Inorganic fertilizers
Cowpea requires more phosphorus (P) than nitrogen in the form of single super
phosphate (SSP). About 16 kg of P/acre is recommended for cowpea production to
help the crop to nodulate well and fix its own nitrogen from the air. The fertilizer
should be thoroughly mixed with soil before placing the seed.

75
f)	 Planting
Cowpeas should be planted at the onset
of rains. For a good plant stand and
high yields, seeds must of high quality.
Generally, for early maturing types,
planting at the beginning of the rains
is advised. Ideally, planting should be
timed in relation to the maturity period
of the variety such that the crop is
harvested during the dry weather. Delay
in planting may result in reduced yields
or crop failure.
Figure 5.4: Planted cowpeas plant
•
Spacing: In sole cropping system of cowpeas planting erect/semi-erect
type the recommended spacing is 60cm × 20cm with two seeds per hole
representing 66,400 plants/acre. For the spreading types wider spacing of 50
cm x 75 cm can be used representing 21,600 plants/acres and later thinned
to two seedlings per hole, one week after germination. When intercropping
with maize, sorghum or millet the recommended spacing is two equidistant
cowpea rows between the rows at 20cm within the row, one seed per hole.
The other alternative is to have one cowpea row between the cereal rows,
two seeds per hole. Generally the seeds are placed 2.0 to 2.5 cm deep in the
soil.
•
Seed rates: Use about 12–25kg/acre of cowpea seeds, depending on the
variety, seed size, cropping system, and viability of the seeds. More seeds
are required when erect varieties are used than when prostrate varieties
are adopted. Similarly, fewer seeds are required when the cowpea is to be
intercropped with other crops. The larger the seeds, the more seeds per acre
are required.
g)	 Crop rotation
This practice is recommended to avoid pest and disease build up. Rotation is
mainly done with cassava, maize, sorghum, millet or any other non-leguminous
crop.
h)	 Weeding
•
Manual weeding: Cowpea should be kept free from weeds. Timely weeding
should be done as soon as weeds emerge and/or before the weeds flower.
Weeding reduces the spread of pest and disease infestation at the early stages.
First weeding should be done two weeks after emergence followed by a
second weeding three weeks later (just before flowering). Avoid weeding at
flowering time to prevent shedding of flowers and when the field is wet to
avoid spread of diseases and soil compaction.
•
Chemical weed control: The choice of herbicide depends on the predominant
weed species and the availability of the herbicide. Herbicides are available
for control of weeds before they emerge (pre-emergence) or after they

76
emerge (post-emergence).  If pre-emergence herbicide is applied at or just
before planting, one manual weeding may be required at 4-5 weeks after
planting.
5.4.3  Crop Protection
Diseases and pests are main contributor to unstable production. Incidence and severity
vary between seasons because of environmental and management practices. Integrated
disease and pest management, using all suitable control measures, is recommended
(Table 5.15).

5.4.4   Postharvest Management and Handling
a)	 Leaves harvesting
Leaves for vegetables use must be young and tender and this is done three weeks
after planting at weekly intervals up to the time flower buds appear (just before
flowering). If the crop was grown for leafy vegetables then uprooting the entire
plant at the 3-5 true leaf stage before the leaves become too mature and fibrous/
tough. Harvesting cowpea at 7-days intervals give higher leaf vegetable yields.
b)	 Dry seed harvesting
Harvest cowpea when the pods are fully mature and dry. In early-maturing and
erect varieties, one picking may be sufficient. For indeterminate and prostrate
varieties, the dried pods can be picked two or three times. The pods do not mature
at the same time because of the staggered flowering period. Matured, dried pods
should be harvested promptly, delay in harvesting will encourage shattering and
weevil infestation in the field.
c)	 Threshing and winnowing
Cowpea can be threshed manually by thrashing the plants or pods on a clean
cement floor, tarpaulin, or beating bagged pods with sticks once they are dry
enough. Various types of threshing machines are available in different sizes,
powered by petrol, diesel, or electricity, for small-, medium-, and large-scale.
Whatever the method used cowpea seed can be easily damaged if threshed too
roughly or when too dry. Test the grain to see if it is dry enough for storage
or market by biting or pinching grain with your finger nails or teeth. When dry
enough, grain should break or crack rather than bend or stick between teeth or
fingernails. Afterwards, winnow against the airflow so that materials such as chaff
and broken seeds are blown away.

78
d)	 Moisture content before storage
After the seed has been threshed, dry them on mats, plastic sheets or wire mesh
trays raised on a platform to about 10% moisture content. The seed should be
spread thinly on the drying surface to allow air to pass through it and turned
regularly to avoid overheating. The seed should be protected from rain, insects,
animals and dirt.
e)	 To check moisture
Pick a clean, dry bottle/jar with a lid, scope a sample (handful) of cowpea seed
and add one tea spoon of salt. Shake the bottle/jar well and then allow the seed to
settle for about 10 minutes. If after 10 minutes one can see damp salt stuck to the
sides of the jar, the seed is too moist. This means that the moisture is above the
required 13%. If the jar is dry and there is no salt stuck to the sides of the bottle/
jar, the seed is well dried.
f)	 Sorting and grading
Sort to remove broken, discoloured, rotten, pest-damaged, immature, shrivelled
seeds and foreign matter as they are characteristics for grading the grains
g)	 Storage
•
Clean the store thoroughly before a new harvest is brought in.
•
Only well-dried and properly cleaned grain should be stored.
•
Well-dried cowpea seed should have less than 13% moisture content with
8-10% moisture content recommended for long term storage.
•
Use hermetic bags such as PICS (Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage) bags to
keep away insects from the grain.
•
Ensure the hermetic bags are protected from rats and mice for effectiveness.
•
The grain can also be dusted with Actellic before storage in metal or plastic
silos
5.4.5 Value Addition and Utilization
Cowpeas are cultivated for the grain (shelled green or dried), the pods or leaves that are
consumed as green vegetables or for green manure. Livestock thrive on the stems and
leaves left once the seeds have been harvested. In Kenya, cowpea grains are consumed
in three basic forms: Cooked together with vegetables or maize, spices and oil, to
produce a thick soup, which accompanies the staple food (rice, ugali or chapati). They

6  FARMING AS A BUSINESS
Farming for the market is a business. It is a business in that farmers use land, labour,
and capital to produce goods for sale. To say that farming is a business is in no sense
to downgrade its importance or to adversely criticize it. Farmers as businessmen
need to understand the risks that they take and the benefit they provide for all of their
customers. Farming is certainly a risky business because it depends on changes in
prices in domestic and foreign markets, and environmental aspects.
6.1  Advantages/ Importance of Farming as a Business
Farming as a business (FAB) helps farmers to get
the best out of their farms and their resources.
Applying business methods such as record
keeping, benefit–cost analysis, marketing skills,
group management skills, gender considerations
and good communication skills can greatly
improve the efficiency of farming. It involves
weighing, sorting, grading and packaging farm
produce collectively at aggregation centres.
In order to understand the farming business,
farm goals are clearly defined. This calls for an
individual farmer to know what to produce (specific farm enterprise); how to produce
it (technological issues); for whom to produce (target market); when to produce
(appropriate market price and profitability); and, how much to produce (where is the
farming business heading to). When everyone involved with the farm (family members,
extension workers, development agencies) understands the goals, they will work better
together towards them.
6.2  Farm Records and Record Keeping
A record is written proof of what happened. Record keeping is an important activity
that is necessary for operating farm enterprises effectively. It involves gathering
valuable data or information on the happenings of a particular undertaking, with a view
to processing it in the future (for example, analysing sales and costs and calculating
profits).  Lack of well documented farm records, makes it problematic for farmers to
establish whether their businesses are making profit or losses. Farm records gives an
account of the various activities carried out on the farm on a regular basis. Farm records
include crops cultivated, livestock kept, varieties planted, breeds reared, management
activities carried out, quantity harvested among others.
6.3  Importance of Record Keeping
Records provide essential information which assists the farmer to do proper farm
planning; credit sourcing; monitoring farm performance and provides basis for proper
decision making. Records give an insight into the money spent if different farm
enterprises and or operations; money received; money obtained from produce sales;
and, determine if a profit or a loss was made.

The common types of farm records include production
records (vital in determining performance of difference
enterprises); labour records (Show the amount and type
of labour hired or employed to work on the farm); Cash
flow records (they record all the cash flow in and out
of the farm business each year); home consumption
records (indicate household intake, date, item and
amount consumed, unit and total price if item was
sold); fixed assets records (indicate all the items present
on the farm at a particular time); and, profit and loss
records (are major farm records that show the economic
performance of the farm). Most farmers tend to keep only this record. However, other
records are important in order to come up with this type of records.
6.4  Markets and Marketing for Cereals and Legumes
A market is a means by which the exchange of goods
and services takes place as a result of buyers and sellers
being in contact with one another, either directly or
through mediating agents or institutions. It is a place
where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods,
services
and other relevant information. Marketing refers to the
process through which the gap between the producers
and consumers is bridged. In this definition, producers are separated by time and
distance. It involves finding out what the consumers want and then supplying them
with the same at a profit. Organized farming business helps reduce the costs of storage
and transportation. This is because it is easier to centrally manage farm produce at
aggregation centres for ease of quality checks and grading; while reducing transport
costs. It also gives the farmers a bargaining advantage when selling their aggregated
farm produce.
