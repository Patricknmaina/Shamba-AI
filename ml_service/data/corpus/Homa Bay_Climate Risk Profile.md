Risk Profile Series
About 74% of the labour force is employed in agriculture. Most of the household income is derived from crop, livestock
and fishery activities. Adult men receive more income from on-farm activities compared to adult women and youth.
Fishing and agriculture also play a crucial role in household food and nutrition security.
In spite of the overreliance on agriculture, half of the population is food insecure. The overall proportion of
households who do not have enough food to meet their household needs throughout the year is 82%.
Food insecurity peaks between July and August and between December and March when harvested
stocks have been depleted.
Food insecurity is linked to low productivity due to factors such as extreme weather, climatic
shocks, unsustainable natural resource management, high prevalence of HIV/AIDS (21.7%) and
limited access to farm inputs. Water availability is also a limiting factor in crop and livestock
production. Only 13.3% of the land under irrigation, despite the County’s huge potential to
irrigate as it borders the largest freshwater lake in Africa, Lake Victoria.
Looking to the future in the years of 2021-2065, temperature is projected to increase by
0.4ºC, with the first wet season projected to experience even greater changes. And by this
time, precipitation is projected to increase by 0.7% in the first wet season, and 3% in the
second wet season. Prolonged moisture stress is projected to occur in the first season of
the year, whereas intense precipitation looks to change little in either season.
Consecutive days of moisture stress is projected to almost double in the first wet season
(January – June) from approximately 25 days to around 45-50. In contrast, moisture stress
in the second wet season (July – December) is projected to decrease from 60 consecutive
days of moisture stress to approximately 50 days.
To cope with climate change and variability, farmers in Homa Bay County are using a number of
on- and off-farm adaptation strategies. On-farm strategies include: soil and water conservation
techniques, adoption of early-maturing varieties, staggered planting, post-harvest handling,
improved storage facilities, and value addition.
Off-farm services, such as early warning systems, extension, capacity building and training, post-
harvest handling and storage facilities and market information, are offered to farmers to increase their
climate adaptive capacity. Such services are offered by a variety of actors such as governmental, non-
governmental, private, faith-based and international organizations. However, the capacity to deliver relevant and
timely information to farmers throughout the County is constrained by coordination of interventions, infrastructure,
and a lack of human and financial resources.

Homa Bay County
Climate change is becoming one of the most serious
challenges to Kenya’s achievement of its development
goals as described under Vision 2030. Kenya is already
extremely susceptible to climate-related events,
and projections indicate that the impacts are likely
to affect the country in the future. In many areas,
extremes and variability of weather are now the norm:
rainfall is irregular and unpredictable; some regions
experience frequent droughts during the Long Rain
seasons or severe floods during the Short Rains. The
arid and semi-arid areas are particularly hard hit by
these extreme changes putting the lives of millions of
households and their social and economic activities
at risk.

In 2010, Kenya developed a National Climate Change
Response
Strategy
(NCCRS)
which
recognized
the importance of climate change impacts for the
country’s development. This was followed by the
development of the National Climate Change Action
Plan (NCCAP) in 2012. The focus of these initiatives
including the development of country climate profiles
have been considered at national level. As the country
shifts towards County governance and focus, there is
need to mainstream climate change perspectives in
programmes and development plans at the County
level.

In support of this effort to strengthen local capacities
of stakeholders to reduce the near-, medium- and
long-term vulnerability to current and future climate
variability, the Kenyan Government, through the
Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries
(MoALF) is implementing the Kenya Adaptation
to Climate Change in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands
(KACCAL) project. The project is funded with a grant
from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) / Special
Climate Change Fund (SCCF) through the World
Bank (WB). The present study is part of the KACCAL
project. It aims to inform the County Government
and stakeholders on the climate change risks and
opportunities for agriculture so that they are able to
integrate these perspectives into their development
plans and processes.

This document presents the Climate Risk Profile for
Homa Bay County, where climate variability has been
accompanied by a significant increase in attendant
risks, as often reported in national news. In recent
years, flash flooding has triggered mudslides and
repeatedly caused major rivers to overflow their banks,
leading to displacement and even death. In 2015, rivers
Maugo, Awach Tende, Rangwe and Riana overflowed
destroying homes and reclaiming farmland on more
than 300 farms. That same year, seven people were
lost to floods and landslides in Homa Bay County
alone. The effects of the flash floods were compounded
by the fact that the County had faced more than
two years of persistent drought that compromised
human and agricultural water sources, forcing the
most affected residents in Kojwang to travel over two
dozen kilometers to collect water. The drought saw
hundreds of livestock, particularly cattle and donkeys,
to perish and led to outbreaks of waterborne diseases,
especially in Karachuonyo. Measures to address these
threats have included handling vaccines, partnering
with World Vision to improve water harvesting and
de-silt water pans; working with state researchers to
introduce drought-tolerant millet crossbreeds; state-
sponsored distribution of drought tolerant crop seeds.
The disastrous nature of extreme weather makes the
identification of impending climate risks an urgent
matter. Likewise, considering how practices that help
citizens become more resilient in the face of imminent
threats to their health, safety, and livelihoods becomes
an exercise with the potential to affect hundreds of
thousands of lives.
The Profile is organized into six main sections, each
reflecting an essential analytical step in studying
current and potential adaptation options in key local
agricultural value chain commodities. The text first
offers an overview of the County’s main value chain
commodities key to food security and livelihoods,
as well as major challenges to agricultural sector
development in the County. In the next section, the main
climate hazards are identified based on the analysis
of historical climate data and climate projections,
including scientific assessments of climate indicators
for dry spells, flooding, and heat stress among other
key hazards for agriculture. Then it continues with an
analysis of the vulnerabilities and risks posed by the
hazards deemed to be potentially most harmful to the
respective value chains. Based on these vulnerabilities,
current and potential on-farm adaptation options and
off-farm services are discussed. The text also provides
snapshots of the policy, institutional and governance
context that can enable adoption of resilience-building
strategies. Finally, it presents potential pathways
for strengthening institutional capacity to address
potential future climate risks.

Climate change is becoming one of the most serious
challenges to Kenya’s achievement of its development
goals as described under Vision 2030. Kenya is already
extremely susceptible to climate-related events, and
projections indicate that the impacts are likely to affect
the country even more in the future. In many areas,
extreme events and variability of weather are now the
norm: rainfall is irregular and unpredictable; some
regions experience frequent droughts during the long
rainy season, others severe floods during the short
rains. The arid and semi-arid areas are particularly
hard hit by these climate hazards, thereby putting the
lives of millions of households and their social and
economic activities at risk.

Economic relevance of farming
Agricultural context
The County of Homa Bay covers an area of 4,267.1
Km2 and is located in south western Kenya along
Lake Victoria, the largest freshwater lake in Africa
with a surface area of 1,227 Km2. Homa Bay County
borders Kisumu and Siaya Counties to the north, Kisii
and Nyamira Counties to the east, Migori County to
the south and the Republic of Uganda to the west. The
County has 16 islands, with unique fauna and flora
and an impressive array of physiographic features with
great aesthetic value of nature. Because its proximity
to Lake Victoria, fishing is one of the main activities
together with agriculture.
Agricultural activities in the County vary with the Agro-
ecological Zones (AEZs). The County is divided into
several (AEZs), namely:
The upper midlands (UM1) occupy the southern
parts of Kasipul and Kabondo Kasipul Sub
Counties where tea and coffee are grown.
The upper midlands (UM3) cover the Gwassi hills
of Suba Sub County. Maize, millet, pineapples,
sorghum, sunflower and tomatoes grow well
here.
The upper midlands (UM4) cover areas
surrounding Gwassi hills of Suba as well as
Ndhiwa and Nyarongi areas of Ndhiwa Sub
County. It supports maize, soya beans and
pineapples.
The lower midlands (LM2) occupy parts of
Ndhiwa, Homa Bay Town, Rangwe, Kasipul and
the north of Kabondo Kasipul Sub Counties.
This zone supports green grams, millet,
sorghum, tobacco, sunflower, sugarcane, beans,
pineapples, sisal and groundnuts.
The lower midlands (LM3) occupy parts of Homa
Bay Town and Rangwe sub-counties. It is suitable
for growing maize, sorghum, cow peas, ground
nuts, beans, soya, sweet potatoes, sunflower,
simsim, green grams, rice and vegetables.
The lower midlands (LM4) occupy a strip along
east of Karachuonyo, central Mbita and Gwassi
areas of Suba Sub County. The area is suitable
for growing cotton.
4	  The labour force is the economically active group of the ages 15-64 that is greatly depended upon by ages 0-14 and those above 64 years
The lower midlands (LM5) occupy south-west
Suba, Rusinga and Mfangano islands, Lambwe
Valley and Gembe and Kasgunga areas of Mbita
Sub County. The area supports livestock rearing
and millet growing.
Agriculture is the leading income contributor to the
households and it plays a crucial role to food and
nutrition security in Homa Bay County. According to
the 2009 Kenya Population and Housing Census, the
employed population in the County stood at about
393,374 representing about 79.5% of the labour force
of which 74% are employed in the agricultural sector.
In 2012, the County earned about KES 4.1 billion from
the major crops, with maize and beans contributing
about KES 2 billion and KES 0.9 billion, respectively.
Maize and beans account for 74% of the estimated
income from the main crops (GoK, 2014) (Annex 1).
The value estimations for horticulture are higher than
for other crops since they have higher gross profit
margins per hectare. In the fiscal year 2012-2013,
322,290 tons of cash crops valued at KES 1.18 billion
were produced. The main cash crops grown in the
County include cotton, sugarcane, rice, pineapple,
sunflower and ground nuts. Coffee and tea are also
marginally produced in the upper zones of the County.
Milk and beef generated KES 1.8 billion and KES 783
million, respectively. The main livestock kept in the
County include zebu cattle, the red Maasai sheep, the
small East African goat and indigenous poultry. Annex
2 presents information on the quantity and value of
livestock products generated in the County.
Most of the income is derived from crop, livestock
and fishery activities. Adult men receive more income
from on-farm activities compared to adult women
and youth. On-farm income earns the households an
average of KES 98,496. Crop income represents 40%
of all on-farm income and livestock represents 21%.
Woodlot activities earn male-headed households an
extra KES 19,050 per year and female-headed and
youth-headed households KES 7,600 and KES 3,733
per year, respectively (GoK, 2014) (Annex 3).
Fishing forms a major economic activity in the County,
as the County borders Lake Victoria, generating
annual revenues of approximately KES 7 billion. It
is a prominent activity in the County, engaging over
18,300 people and 3,600 families. The main species
caught include Nile perch, tilapia and clarias (Omena).
In 2012, 76,710 tons of fish worth KES 7 billion were

Homa Bay County
People and livelihoods
As indicated above, the great majority of the County`s
population is employed in agriculture, dividing their
activities between crop production, livestock rearing,
and fishery. About 104,464 hectares are dedicated
According to the 2009 census, in  2012, the  population
was projected  to be 1,038,858 persons (498,472 men
and 540,386 women). The population is expected to
rise to 1,177,181 by 2017. Rural population from the
2012 projections stands at of 956,501 which is about
92% of the total population of the County. About 44%
of this rural population are poor. (GoK, 2013).
About 50% of the population of Homa Bay County is
food insecure (GoK, 2013). The overall proportion of
households who do not have enough food to meet
their household requirements throughout the year is
82%. Among the male-, female- and youth-headed
households at least 82%, 81% and 84% of households
do not have enough to meet the household needs5.
(GoK, 2014)6 Food insecurity peaks between July and
August and between December and March, when food
stocks have been depleted.
The manifestation of malnutrition among children is in
the high incidences with prevalence of stunting 26.3%,
underweight 15%, and wasting 4.2%. According to
the Kenya Integrated and Household Budget Survey
(KIHBS) the absolute poverty level in the County
is 52.9%, higher than the national level of 45.2%.
The major factors which contribute to poverty are:
high unemployment, high cost of living, population
pressure, poor yields, low price of agricultural
produce, poor infrastructure, and lack of credit and
high incidence of HIV/AIDS. The majority of the poor
are women and youth. The literacy rate in the County
stands at 64% with men accounting for 66%, women
54% and youth 74%.

Food security is defined as a state whereby, at individual, household, national, regional and global levels, “all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to
sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO, 1996)
6
Household food security refers both to the availability and to stability of food, together with purchasing power of the household (GoK, 2014)
captured. Of these, Nile perch contributed KES 5 billion
and clarias contributed KES 1.7 billion. Aquaculture is
relatively underdeveloped in the County. Around 1,801
fishponds covering an area of 540,300 square meters
(m2) are found. In 2014, 783 tonnes of farmed fish
valued at KES 159,554 million were produced in the
County (GoK, 2015).
to food crops, 12,277 hectares to cash crops, 6,000
hectares to horticulture and 54 hectares to aquaculture.
The main food crops produced in the County include
maize, beans, sorghum, millet, kales, sweet potatoes
and peas. The vast majority (80%) of the farmers grow
maize and beans (GoK, 2014). The main livestock
kept in the County include zebu cattle, the red Maasai
sheep, the small East African goat and indigenous
poultry. Most of these livestock are bred for their
sentimental value and are used only in emergencies
to cover medical and transport costs, pay school
fees, entertain guests and pay dowry. There is limited
grazing land available in the County and thus limited
commercial development of livestock. (GoK, 2013).
This explains the lack of group and company ranches.
The mean land holding size in Homa Bay County
stands at 6 acres (around 2.4 hectares). On average,
2 acres are used for settlement and the remaining 4
acres is used for agricultural and rural development
purposes. The average farm size for small-scale farmers
is 4 acres while that of large-scale farmers is 10 acres.
The large-scale farmers are found mainly in the less
densely populated areas of Ndhiwa, Suba and Mbita
Sub Counties where large stocks of livestock are kept.
These are in the lower midland AEZ (LM5). The main
crops grown on large-scale farms are maize, sorghum,
beans and agroforestry systems. Smallholdings are
prominent in the densely populated areas (UM1, UM3,
UM4, LM2) of Homa Bay Town, Rangwe, Kasipul and
Kabondo Kasipul where the main crops grown are
maize, beans, pineapples, groundnuts and potatoes.
(GoK, 2013).
The percentage of land with title deeds in Homa Bay
County stands at about 48%. Most land is communal.
Landlessness in the County is estimated at 3%. This
is because of land adjudication process and the vast
majority of residents are indigenous people with
customary rights to hereditary land. The vast majority
of the landless are migrants in trading centres and
returnees who were forced back in the wake of the
post-election violence of 2008. (GoK, 2013).
The three major farm inputs used on annual crops are
seed/planting materials, field pesticides and organic
manure. The levels of inputs used on annual crops by
different households vary between seasons and crop
type. Other farm inputs include: storage pesticides,
herbicides, top dressing fertiliser and planting fertilisers.
The main farm activities in which machinery is used

Agricultural value chain commodities in Homa Bay
Agricultural value chain commodities
are ploughing (53%) followed by harrowing (35%).
Other mechanized activities are planting, carrying/
transportation and milking. The County Government
also provides subsidized tractor hire services. There
is one tractor in each of the 8 Sub Counties and the
charges are KES 3,000 per acre. This is important
for early land preparation and avoiding the impact
of climate shocks such as dry spells. By April 2016,
a total of 2,500 acres was ploughed using tractor
hire services. The Kenya Department of Agriculture
organizes demonstration blocks in the 40 electoral
wards in the County, with each ward growing different
crops, based on comparative advantage.
The most commonly used inputs for livestock
production include acaricides (38%), dewormers
(37%) and vaccines (33%). Less than 1% of farmers
use artificial insemination to upgrade livestock.
Proportionately, more adult male-headed households
use livestock inputs than adult female-headed or youth-
headed households. However, more youth-headed
households use fodder, vaccines and other veterinary
drugs compared to male-headed and female-headed
households.
Only 13.3% of the land is under irrigation. Major
horticultural crop grown under irrigation include kales,
tomatoes, onions, capsicum and watermelon. The
County’s potential for irrigated agriculture is 8,966
hectares (GoK, 2013).
The County’s generally low productivity and yields are
associated with low input use, particularly by adult
female- and youth-headed households. High cost of
agricultural inputs is the main constraint.
Agricultural production in Homa Bay County is
characterized by subsistence farming and small-scale
production of commercial crops, livestock production,
fish farming and capture fishing. Various value chains
have been prioritized for development interventions
by different government organizations and programs
such as the Agricultural Sector Development Support
Programme (ASDSP), the Kenya Agricultural and
Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) and
University of Nairobi survey, and the Kenya Agricultural
Productivity Program (KAPP). For the development of
this County Climate Risk Profile, four major agriculture
value chain commodities (VCCs) were selected for in-
depth analysis based on their contribution to food
security, productivity characteristics and importance
to the economy. These VCCs, validated by local
stakeholders, have been selected from a list compiled
from the above-mentioned documents using the
following prioritization indicators: harvested area
(hectares), production (90 kg bags), variation in
production (in the past five years), value of production
(KES$/bag), dietary energy consumption (Kcal/capita/
day), protein content (gr of protein/100 gr of product),

Maize
Fish

Total income generated from the food crop was 4.1 billion
Maize is a major contributor to the household food
security and nutrition. The vast majority (80%) of
farmers grow maize since it is considered a staple food
(GoK, 2013). Maize has comparative advantage in the
upper midland zones of the County (UM1, UM3, and
UM4) and lower midland zone (LM3). The popular ugali
is important in the Luo community, where dry maize
is milled to maize flour and cooked to ugali which can
be accompanied by vegetables and proteins such as
fish and Nyoyo where the maize is mixed with beans.
Income from maize production represented 50.84%
(KES 2 billion7) of the total income from major food
crops generated in the County.
Maize is grown in both the first season (March to May)
and the second season (October to December) across
the County. However in some parts of the County
such as Lambwe, the farmers tend to grow maize only
once a year (during the second season), due to the
unreliable rainfall patterns. Maize requires abundant
annual rainfall (1,200-2,500 mm) while rainfall in
Homa Bay County is low and unreliable, ranging from
700 to 800 mm. While male-, female-, and youth-
headed households alike grow maize on relatively
small areas of land, male-headed households tend to
use more inputs and register higher yields compared
to women and youth. Annex 4 shows yields of major
crops in the County by gender. Women, however, tend
to use organic manure more than men as it is readily
available on farm.
Farm inputs are bought from seed companies and
farm input dealers, The National Cereal and Produce
Board (NCPB) depot is also responsible for providing
farm inputs such as the fertilisers and seeds at
iron content (mg of iron /100 gr of product), zinc
content (mg of zinc/100 gr of product), and Vitamin A
content (IU Vitamin A/100 gr of product).
The selected value chains for Homa Bay are maize,
beans, fish, and local poultry. Maize and beans were
selected mainly for food security because they are
staple foods in the County; fish on the other hand and
local poultry were selected for economic purposes
because of high demand in the market. The rest of this
section focuses on the four value chain commodities
and the subsequent sections discuss how they are
affected by climatic conditions.
subsidized prices. On-farm maize production also
involves weeding to ensure pests and weed control to
minimize competition and maximize yields. There has
been increasing weeds and pests in maize production
over the years according to the farmers’ testimonials.
Such weeds and pests include but are not limited to:
parasitic striga weeds, stem borers and stalk borer and
storage pesticides such as large grain borer commonly
known by the farmers as osama
The main storage facilities in the County include cribs
(75% of the farmers use these) and gunny bags (24%).
Only 1% of the population appears to use silos. Silos
are used mostly by the NCPB at their mini depot in
Magunga (GoK, 2013). The Big NCPB depot in Homa
Bay Town is not used for storage of produce.
There are no well-defined farmers groups and
cooperatives in this value chain, maize is thus sold in
most cases at the household level in the local market
centres on market days. Major market centres in the
County include: Sindo, Ndhiwa, Rodi Kopany, Kosele,
Mirogi, Rangwe, Adiedo, Nyangweso, Aora Chuodho,
Magunga, Ringa, Kadongo, Chabera, Misambi, Ruga,
Nyandiwa, Ogongo and Sena.
Fishing forms a major economic activity in the County.
This is attributed to the fact that the County borders
the largest fresh water lake in Africa, Lake Victoria, and
has a number of rivers that are important in fishing
activities. Homa Bay County has two types of fishing
activities: capture fishing and aquaculture.
A total of 17,000 fishermen in the County rely on
fishing for their household income. The Riparian
Sub Counties that engage in capture fishing include
Rangwe, Karachuonyo, Mbita, Suba and Homa Bay
Sub County and are located in UM3, UM4, LM3,
LM4, LM5 zones.  Aquaculture is practiced across
the County. Fishing guarantees generation of annual
revenues of approximately KES.7 billion. The main
species caught include Nile Perch, Tilapia and Clarias
(Omena) (GoK, 2013).
In the year 2012, 76,710 tons of fish worth KES 7
billion were captured. Of these, Nile perch contributed
KES 5 billion and clarias (Omena) contributed KES
1.7 billion (GoK, 2013).

According to GoK 2013, of these BMUs, 61 are in Mbita, 33 in Suba, 30 in Rachuonyo North and four in Homa Bay.
In almost every household, indigenous chickens freely
roam around homesteads and scavenge for food
with very little supplementary feeding and minimal
additional inputs, such as sorghum, millet or maize.
However, the economically-enriched farmers buy
feeds from the local agro dealers to supplement the
feeding of poultry for growth and productivity as most
of them keep improved indigenous poultry.
Beans are a staple food in the County and are grown
in both seasons by a vast majority (80%) of farmers
across the County (GoK, 2013). Beans thrive well in
AEZs UM4, LM2, LM3. Incomes from bean production
represented 23% (Ksh 0.9 billion) of the total income
from major food crops generated in the County (GoK,
2014).
Capture fishing requires nets and boats as inputs.
The Beach Management Unit (BMU), fishermen and
Government are involved in the conservation of the
breeding sites to protect the fish stock. The County
has 151 landing beaches8 managed under 133 Beach
Management Units. (GoK, 2013). These landing
beaches have become influential trading centres in the
County especially for fish products. Examples of landing
beaches which have become thriving trading centres
include Nyandiwa, Ringiti, Remba, Kwethumbe, Alum,
Kaugege, Ndhuru and Sena. There are no fishing
groups, or cooperatives in the County.
The main challenge in this value chain are invasive
species such as the recurrent water hyacinth,
hindering fishing and depriving the lake of oxygen,
overexploitation affecting the fish stock, exploitation
by middlemen.
Aquaculture is relatively underdeveloped in the County,
even though it is practiced across the County. In all,
1,801 fishponds are found in Homa Bay, covering an
area of 540,300 m2. There are about 2,000 fish farmers
involved in aquaculture. Fingerlings, fishponds, feeds
and fishing nets are key inputs required by farmers in
this value chain.
In aquaculture, there are fish farmer groups as well
as a cooperative, also known as Homa Bay County
Aquaculture
Multipurpose
Cooperative
Society
(AMCS). The presence of the cooperative helps in
linking buyers and sellers, pricing and the promotion
of the value chain. Other actors that play a role in
marketing are middlemen and BMU’s. Fish farmers
use cooler boxes to store their fish.
Homa Bay County is home to two fish processing
industries in Homa Bay Town and Mbita Point from
which fish produce is exported to other counties as far
as Nairobi County (GoK, 2013). Processing enhances
the quality and increases the shelf life of fish.
Beans grow at temperatures that range between 17.5
and 27oC. The temperatures in the County range
from 17.1°C to 34.8°C (GoK, 2013). Beans require a
moderate, well-distributed rainfall of 900-1200 mm
per annum, however, dry weather during harvest is
very important. Irrigation is important to maintain a
continuous production. However, rainfall in Homa Bay
is low and unreliable; the County receives an annual
rainfall ranging from 700 to 800 mm.
Suitable soil type for growing beans range from light to
moderately heavy to peaty (with organic matter) soils
with good drainage. This is not quite the scenario in
Homa Bay County, hence the need for fertilisers to
increase the soil fertility. Farm inputs are bought from
seed companies and farm input dealers in market
centres, The NCPB depots in Homa Bay and Kendu
are providing farm input such as fertilisers and seeds
at subsidized prices. Some farmers also use pesticides
to achieve pest and disease control for high output.
Post-harvest activities refer to threshing and winnowing
to add value, packaging, dusting and storage to
lengthen beans’ shelf life. Most of the farmers (75%)
use cribs and gunny bags (24%) for storage (GoK,
2013).
The prices of beans are determined by the market forces
of demand and supply and there are no cooperatives
in this value chain. Thus, bulking, bargaining power,
accessibility of trade facilities and setting of prices is
compromised. Beans are sold at the household level
at local and major market centres. Annex 4 shows the
yield of beans by season and gender. Male-headed
households tend to use more inputs and register
higher yields. Men dominate in decision-making for
market-oriented crops such as beans and others such
as green grams, kales, and maize. However, the role of
women is more prominent in groundnuts and sweet
potatoes which are also market oriented (GoK, 2014).

Past and future impacts of climate hazards in Homa Bay

11
Homa Bay County
Local poultry production is found across all AEZs in
the County. Indigenous chickens are reared for both
food security and income generation. The proceeds
are used to pay school fees and for emergencies such
as hospital bills etc.
Some farmers have built housing to protect the
poultry from predators, diseases, pests and adverse
climatic conditions. Because of the informal nature
of production, information related to inputs and
production volumes and quantities is limited. The
faith-based organization Caritas of Homa Bay also
constructs poultry units to support poor farmers in
the County through their Agricultural Environmental
Program. The Kenyan Department of Veterinary
Services (KDVS) supplies vaccination services on
demand. There is a revolving fund for vaccines such
as Newcastle disease vaccine in this value chain,
minimum cost is KES 1009 for 50 birds. The Kenya
Livestock Department (KLD) trains farmers in local
poultry management however the farmer-staff ratio is
very low and the County has only 2 veterinary doctors.
Homa Bay County Local Poultry Value Chain
Cooperative Society (LPVCCS) is the main cooperative
for poultry farmers in the County. However, it is not
actively involved in the market dynamics of the value
chain. Other actors involved include middlemen
involved in promotion, selling and pricing.
Most of the decisions regarding local poultry is done
by women who have a say in the disposal, sale and use
of income accrued from the sale. Women are more
likely to be owners of small livestock compared to men
who prefer larger livestock such as the local cow, goat
and sheep as they fetch more income than poultry
keeping.
Agricultural sector challenges
Homa Bay County has the potential to feed itself and
export surplus to neighbouring counties, however it
faces perennial food shortages and food insecurity
due to low productivity (GoK, 2013), driven by factors
such as outbreak of pests/diseases, low soil fertility,
inadequate staff at the ward level, high poverty levels,
dependency on rain-fed agriculture and increased
climate hazards (drought and floods). The situation is
further exacerbated by low acreage under cultivation,
which implies that harvested products remain far below
household consumption needs in virtually all seasons.
Inadequate access to farm inputs such as improved
genetic material for plants and animals, pest and
9
Sh.2 per bird
vector control, and machinery contributes to poor
quality and low volume of production. Due to the
limited availability and prohibitive cost of high quality
plant and livestock breeds and husbandry services,
crop and livestock farmers have resorted to using low
quality seeds and uncertified planting materials.
Unsustainable
land
management
practices
compromise agricultural productivity in the County.
Farmers have limited skills and training due to low
uptake of technology and the scarcity of adequate
agricultural extension personnel. Farmers often use
poor agronomic practices because of lack of knowledge
that lead to environment degradation consequently
limiting the exploitation of County’s agricultural
potential. The availability of adequate technology is
important in production, processing, preservation and
marketing of the agricultural products. For instance,
in fishing, there are only two processing plants while
fishing is a key economic activity in the County. The
lack of appropriate technology and skills can be
attributed to the remaining 36% of the population
that are illiterate. Dependency on rain-fed agriculture
also greatly affect productivity of rain-fed crops and
livestock in the County where only 13.3% of the land
is irrigated.
Low mechanization of production to increase efficiency
and poor storage facilities have hampered progress
in the sector as over 90% of farmers use traditional
production and storage methods which limit their
output. The main storage facilities in the County are
cribs (75%) and gunny bags (24%). Only a paltry 1%
of the population appears to use silos. Silos are used
mostly by the National Cereals and Produce Board in
their mini depot in Magunga (GoK, 2013).
The general lack of market information and skills
amongst farmers and the business community has
hampered the expansion of markets for products
from the County. Weak and inadequate farmers’
cooperative societies coupled with the poor road
network in the County are major hindrances to the
marketing process. Cooperatives such as Homa Bay
County AMCS, Homa Bay CLPVCCS are not taking
up their role adequately in the market dynamics. Poor
organization of farmer groups has exposed farmers to
exploitation by middlemen.
HIV/AIDS-related
morbidity
and
mortality
has
diminished the workforce and reduced agricultural
productivity in the County. The County has an HIV/
AIDS prevalence of about 27.1% compared to the
national average of about 6.3% (NACC, 2014).

12 Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series
10	 Refers to the wettest 1-day event (mm/day) indicator in the infographic.
11	 Note that this is 20 mm on average over the entire County, so specific parts of the County will have experienced greater than this (possibly much greater), whereas other parts
will have experienced less.
12	 The two RCPs, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, are named after a possible range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values (+2.6 and +8.5 W/m2, respectively).
The pathways are used for climate modelling and research. They describe two possible climate futures, considered possible depending on how much greenhouse gases are
emitted in the years to come. RCP 2.6 assumes that global annual GHG emissions (measured in CO2-equivalents) peak between 2010 and 2020, with emissions declining
substantially thereafter. In RCP 8.5, emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century.
Other factors which have hampered farming activities
include rules of inheritance of land and subsequent
land fragmentation. This has reduced land sizes
among families leaving only small plots of land for
food production.
Despite being major contributors to agricultural
production, cultural norms deny women access to
production resources and decision-making. Men still
control the means of production. Women cannot
access credit for significant investment requiring a
title deed as collateral as land title deeds remain under
control of men. Culturally, women are not empowered
to make serious decisions unless it is in consultation
with their spouses.
Major constraints to the growth of the fishery industry
include: water hyacinth (which obstructs the fish
landing sites), use of illegal fishing gears, inadequate
patrols, receding water level, exploitation by middlemen
and declining fish stocks due to overexploitation in the
lake.
The major problems facing the livestock sector are
Tsetse fly infestation, especially around Lambwe valley,
drought, malnutrition, and low quality livestock breeds.
There is some variation in precipitation throughout
Homa Bay County, with the southern areas further
from Lake Victoria receiving the most precipitation
around 1750 mm, and the northern areas closer to
Lake Victoria receiving 1000-1250 mm of precipitation
per year. The temperature is fairly consistently
warm through the year. Precipitation also consistent
throughout the year, although the first wet season
(January-June) receives a slightly greater amount.
Intense precipitation and heat stress are both hazards
that contribute to agricultural risk in the County
throughout the year, whereas dry spells are more an
issue in the second wet season.
Historic analysis of weather in Homa Bay County
shows that both dry spells and extreme precipitation
are hazards in the County. Dry spells are on average
longer during the second wet season and consistently
close to 60 consecutive days of moisture stress,
whereas moisture stress is consistently less than 30
days during the first wet season. Extreme precipitation
and flood risks10 are moderate to low in both seasons,
with most years receiving between 10 and 25 mm of
precipitation on the wettest day11.
Climate has already been observed to change slightly
in the County. Since 1981, the first wet season—the
predominant rains of the year—have experienced a
moderate (1ºC) increase in mean temperature and
associated reduction in crop cycle, and a small (~10%)
decrease in precipitation on average. The combination
of increased temperatures and decreased precipitation
make for an increase in drought risk. The second
wet season experienced a mild (~0.5ºC) increase in
temperature, and a significant (20–30%) increase in
precipitation. This has resulted in increased risk of
flooding.
Looking to the future in the years of 2021-2065 (by the
early 2040’s), temperature is projected to increase by
0.4ºC, with the first wet season projected to experience
even greater changes. And by this time, precipitation is
projected to increase by 0.7% in the first wet season,
and 3% in the second wet season. Prolonged moisture
stress is projected to occur in the first season of the
year, whereas intense precipitation looks to change
little in either season. Consecutive days of moisture
stress is projected to almost double in the first wet
season from approximately 25 days to around 45-50.
In contrast, moisture stress in the second wet season
is projected to decrease from 60 consecutive days
of moisture stress to approximately 50 days. These
projections of future climate change under the two
climate scenarios—RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.512—show
some small differences, but generally show the same
future projections, suggesting climate change impacts
will be fairly similar during this time frame irrespective
of greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate from the farmers’ perspective
Climate Vulnerabilities across
Agriculture Value Chain
Maize
Climate change has already had adverse effects on
agricultural production systems and food security as
a result of increased frequency of extreme weather
events and unpredictability of weather patterns.
Excessive rains and subsequent flooding, shifting
patterns of storms and droughts, and warmer overall
temperatures are just some of the effects (FAO, 2013).
In Homa Bay, where crops are rain fed and livestock
farmers depend mostly on natural pasture, long dry
spells and irregular rainfall exacerbate the problem
of low yields and leave rural households even more
susceptible to food insecurity. Climate hazards affect
the key value chains in different ways, as discussed
below.
Farmers in Homa Bay County attest to the on-going and
intensifying changes to climate and weather patterns
in the County over time. Increased cases of flooding
have been reported around Magunga in Gwasi, Sindo
areas, Wahambla in Homa Bay, lower parts of Ndhiwa,
Lambwe area and Rusinga in Mbita, lower parts of
Kochia. Unpredictable seasonal patterns affecting
agricultural activities such as the onset and end date
of the seasons have been observed: “a while back, it
was so obvious that the long rains would start at 15th
March but now it goes beyond mid-April and beyond”.
Uneven distribution of rain coupled with inaccurate
weather forecasts lead to more crop failure. Cases of
hailstorms have been recorded in Homa Bay Town,
Homa Bay West ward, South Kanyabala and North
Kanyabala, Arujo areas and in some parts of Ndhiwa
bordering South Kanyabala. Increased temperatures
as high as 38oC around January to February leading
to the depletion of natural pastures on which 99% of
livestock depend as well as loss of livestock. Around
January and February, the communities experience
water scarcity because the rivers dry up. Increased
incidences of crop and livestock diseases in the County
were also reported.
Water level in the lake is rising due to extreme rainfall
and/or the deposition of sediment brought in by the
rivers upstream.
Maize production in Homa  Bay  County is almost entirely
dependent on rainfall, and thus highly susceptible to
climate shocks. Moisture stress is a major limiting
factor for maize growth and productivity, as is high
rainfall/floods. Maize requires high rainfall of 1,200
to 2,500 mm, whereas the County’s annual rainfall
is low and unreliable ranging from 700 to 800 mm.
The lakeshore lowlands areas (Mbita, Karachuonyo,
Homa Bay, Suba) are more likely to be affected by
the predicted reduction in rainfall that will affect
soil moisture in the LM2, LM3, LM4 and LM5 agro
ecological zones. Maize yields are therefore likely to be
affected unless soil and water conservation measures,
use of drought-tolerant varieties and irrigation are
adopted. Maize is also vulnerable to weeds and pests
that proliferate during moisture stress, requiring
treatment with pesticides or chemicals that most of the
farmers in the County cannot afford. This is attributed
to the high absolute poverty rate that stands at 44.1%13.
Maize production over the years according to farmers’
testimonials has experienced increased weed and
pests such as: parasitic striga weeds, stem borer and
stalk borer, and large grain borer commonly known by
farmers as osama. The increased incidences of weed
infestation lead to competition for soil nutrients and
lower production consequently leading to demand
spikes and high prices for buyers
The reduction in soil moisture makes tilling the land
difficult and leads to seeds scorching which causes
poor germination.  Maize is sensitive to acidity which
exacerbates when there is moisture stress. Increased
incidences of pests such as the large grain borer can
cause considerable losses in stored maize and also
lead to a higher demand of storage pesticides. The
economically endowed can cope with price increases,
however, poor farmers can’t. This is further exacerbated
by the poor storage facilities in the County. In spite
of this, farmers are culturally attracted to maize and
reluctant to shift to heat-resistant sorghum or millet.
Lack of diversification makes them more vulnerable to
climate risks. Farmer groups and insurance companies
could cover smallholders’ risks against adverse climatic
conditions, however, there are no farmer cooperatives
in this value chain.

14 Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series
Bean
Poultry (local)
Heat stress is a limiting factor to the growth of beans
and so is flooding. Beans require a moderate, well-
distributed rainfall (900-1200 mm) per annum,
however, dry weather during harvest is also very
important. During the dry season, beans require up to
50 mm of water per week. Prolonged dry conditions
are harmful to beans. Rainfall in Homa Bay County
is low and unreliable, ranging from 700 to 800 mm.
Lake shore lowlands (LM2, LM3, LM4 and LM5)
such as Mbita, Karachuonyo, Homa Bay, Suba are
more vulnerable to the heat stress compared to the
uplands. Suitable soil type for beans range from light
to moderately heavy with organic matter in the soil,
however some parts of the County have black cotton
soil which is very hard when dry and difficult to till.
Heat stress leads to poor quality, inadequate and high
cost of seeds in the County. Beans experience scorching
of the seed leading to low or no germination. Resource-
poor farmers (especially women) are more vulnerable
to this impact, as they are not able to buy the good
quality seed when prices are high. Pests and diseases
are also more pronounced during the heat stress, e.g.
a higher incidence of aphids. This will exacerbate yield
losses and at the same time require a higher usage of
pesticides leading to increased production costs. The
high temperatures also make the dusting chemicals
ineffective.
Local poultry are adversely affected by heat stress due to
inadequate feeds, water availability, and the increased
incidence of disease leading to poultry deaths. This
consequently leads to a decline in production and/or
the loss of stock.
Beans are also sensitive to flooding. Farmers in the
lake shore low lands (LM2, LM3, LM4 and LM5) are
more susceptible to flooding than the upland farmers.
Beans require a moderate, well-distributed rainfall of
900-1200 mm per annum, however, rainfall in excess
can be detrimental. Excessive rainfall leads to rotting of
bean seeds and leaching of soil nutrients and fertilisers
applied reducing the fertiliser efficiency. Incidences of
pests and diseases are also more pronounced during
floods, they include whiteflies, root rot, angular leaf
spot. Farmers have little or inadequate knowledge on
proper drainage and raised-bed cropping. However,
the economically endowed farmers are able to use
some of these techniques unlike the poor farmers.
Flooding choke plant roots interfering with the
translocation of nutrients. Suitable soil types for the
bean range from light to moderately heavy, with soil
organic matter. However, most soils in the County
are black cotton soils that, difficult to till when wet.
Flooding also leads to poor quality of seeds due to
moulding which lowers colour and quality, reducing
the palatability and market price of the seeds. This will
make the household that depend on the sale of beans
for their livelihood more vulnerable than others.
Dusting, threshing and winnowing are all compromised.
Dry weather during harvest is very important.
However, the wealthier farmers have the capacity to
buy tarpaulins, covered sheds, drying granary for
post-harvest handling. This kind of equipment is not
accessible to poor farmers in the County.
Excessive rain damages the road network in the
County, affecting transport and leading to increased
production costs.
Pest and disease incidences for bean are likely to
increase with droughts and floods. This includes
aphids during the dry periods, white flies during the
wet season, as well as diseases such as root rot and
angular leaf spot. These lead to increased production
losses and higher use of pesticides.
Flooding, likewise, has adverse effects on maize
production. The lower agro-ecological zones (LM2,
LM3, LM4 and LM5) such as Karachuonyo, Gwasi,
Mbita and Ndhiwa are more vulnerable to flood risks.
Flooding leads to crop yield losses, soil erosion, water
logging, and leaching of soil nutrients and fertilisers.
The seeds viability is also reduced as the seeds rot in
the soil.
Excessive rainfall especially during harvest can lead
to increased rotting. In addition, inadequate drying of
maize under wet conditions is likely to increase chances
of aflatoxin contamination. Only 1% of the population
appears to use silos for storage (GoK, 2013).
Damage to the road network due to flooding leads
to increased prices of farm inputs. Flooding also
causes transport problems to the 12 islands which
are accessible only by boat increasing the cost of
transportation and consequently production costs.

15
Homa Bay County
Fish
Heat stress leads to increased evaporation and
reduced water levels both at the fresh water lake and
the fishponds. The nets become difficult to use when
the water level is low. Low water levels compromises
the survival of fingerlings. This also has an impact on
the breeding sites, making harvesting difficult and in
many cases forcing farmers to reduce grow out period
from 9 to 6 months.
Heat stress increases the cost of preservation of fish
and also leads to a shortage of fish in the market,
creating the need for fish imports (such as the China
fish).
Fish is also sensitive to high rainfall and flooding,
causing migration out of the ponds. High rainfall
may have adverse impacts on the power supply
and communication network which is an important
input for storage. Power cuts will affect the quality
of the fish harvested and kept in cooler boxes and
refrigerators. Damage to the road network will affect
the transportation, processing and access to the
market.
Again, the effects of heat stress are not experienced
equally by all farmers; wealthier farmers will have the
capacity to procure water or engage in water harvesting
techniques and purchase and/or store supplementary
feed as well as construct proper housing for the
birds. Contrarily, the increased costs of production
will adversely impact the poor and likely result in low
volumes of trade, and increased prices. Farmers in the
lowland lake shore areas are more likely to be affected
than the upland farmers. Farmers with inadequate
knowledge on the usage of vaccines are likely to be
affected more than farmers who have the knowledge
and access to vaccines.
In addition, high rainfall/floods damage storage
facilities and road networks, threatening the availability
and price of important inputs such as vaccines. As
the market supply reduces, the price for local poultry
increases.
Adaptation to climate change
and variability
On-farm adaptation practices
To cope with climate change and variability, farmers
in Homa Bay County have come up with a number
of on-farm adaptation strategies. Some of the most
widely used on-farm strategies include: tree planting,
improved soil and water conservation, adaptation of
early-maturing varieties and water harvesting, post-
harvest handling, value adding processing, among
others. There is a lot of integration of indigenous
knowledge in adaptation options such as the use of
sawdust in the preservation of grains and the use of
salting, smoking, drying of fish. The infographic below
presents into more detail these adaptation options,
along with potential strategies that could complement
these, to increase farmers’ resilience to climate
hazards. Annex 5 identifies patterns of adaptation
options by head of household, as well as the common
input requirements and challenges to implementation.
Soil and water conservation strategies are most
common in the warm and dry AEZs (LM2, LM3, LM4
and LM5) and they include conservation agriculture
(cover cropping, minimum tillage, and crop rotation
techniques), planting of Napier grass, mulching. Such
practices are mostly adopted by youth- and male-
headed households (28%), given that soil conservation
is usually more labour-intensive. There is a need for
more awareness raising about the benefits of such
practices among farmers in order to scale out adoption.
Water harvesting techniques used in Homa Bay
County involve the construction of water pans, shallow
wells, and water tanks. Such strategies are, however,
less adopted by farmers14, given the large fresh water
surface area of the County (1,227 km2), as the county
borders Lake Victoria to the west. Additionally, such
strategies tend to be capital-intensive, limiting adoption
by resource-poor farmers.
14	 Adoption rates are highest among youth- and men-headed households, compared to female-headed households:  24.8%, 34.0% and 13.2% respectively.

16 Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series
Off-farm adaptation practices
Tree planting and agroforestry initiatives are facilitated
by the National Environmental Management Authority
(NEMA), the Kenya Forestry Service (KFS), and Caritas
Homa Bay, who actively support the County’s efforts
to increase its forest cover. However, community
participation in such initiatives is still low and is related
to limited awareness raising among the County
population.

Farmers also opt for change in crop, livestock and
fish types and varieties/breeds to respond to climate
shocks such as increased temperatures, drought
and floods. Farmers in the warm and dry zones have
taken up early-maturing varieties (of maize [DH 04
and Simba], cassava [MM series, Minjera] and beans,
among others) and varieties resistant to drought
(groundnut, millet, green gram, and sorghum). In
aquaculture, farmers shorten the fish-rearing period
from 9 to 6 months. However, in general, adoption of
such strategies are hampered by farmers´ poor access
to improved seeds, given high prices (especially of the
early-maturing varieties and improved local breeds of
livestock and artificial insemination).
Most of the farmers in the County depend on natural
fodder. However, due to the climatic shocks in the
County, some of the farmers shift to feed conservation
and diversification. The push-pull technology that
discussed in the next section, promoted by the
International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology
(ICIPE) has had significant benefits for dairy farming,
since silverleaf desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum)
and Napier grass are both high quality animal fodder
plants. Farmers in the warm and dry AEZs (LM2, LM3,
LM4, and LM5) tend to practice this more as they are
adversely affected by climate shocks.
Value addition increases the shelf life of the products
and competitive advantage on the markets, yet it is not
widely practised by farmers in Homa Bay County. Some
of the few value addition activities include grading,
dehulling and flour-making (for cereals and pulses), oil
extraction (for oil crops such as sunflower, common in
AEZs UM3, LM2 and LM3), drying and extraction (for
medicinal plants), grading and chopping (in the case
of fodder crops). Fish farmers and fishermen engage
in salting, smoking, drying activities. In general, there
is little knowledge on value addition techniques among
farmers.
Off-farm services, such as early-warning systems,
extension, capacity building and training, post-
harvest handling and storage facilities and market
information, are offered to farmers to increase their
adaptive capacity. Such services are offered by a
variety of actors, from local government (such as the
meteorological, veterinary, agriculture, and livestock
departments) to faith-based organizations such as
Caritas of Homa Bay, to international organizations
such as the International Centre of Insect Physiology
and Ecology (ICIPE) and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID).
Many of the off-farm services are organized through
participatory scenario planning meetings facilitated
by the ASDSP. These meetings are organized every
season and bring together key stakeholders under
the guidance of professional experts who assist in
collectively finding ways to interpret the information
(both local and scientific knowledge) into a form that is
locally relevant and useful. They plan for worse, normal
and good scenarios in every season based on seasonal
forecasts given by the meteorological department.
This information is then disseminated to different
stakeholders through participatory advisory bulletins.
These bulletins include advisories on the weather
forecasts, highlights, expected hazards, type of seed
varieties that will best suit a particular agro ecological
zone, and the best breeds that are most adaptable to
the expected hazards, adaptation strategies, such as
conservation agriculture, tree planting etc. They also
disseminate it through the radio as the majority of
farmers can afford radio and listen to broadcasts of
vernacular radio stations such as ramogi and sunset.
Early-warning systems enable farmers to know when
and where to plant and when to move with the
livestock in the event of climate hazards. The Kenya
Meteorological Department (KMD) is responsible for
the County’s early-warning systems. By integrating
scientific and traditional knowledge, KMD generates
seasonal forecasts and disseminates the information
to relevant stakeholders through Chief barazaas and
WhatsApp to the heads of the departments.

practices
such
as
intercropping,
conservation
agriculture, water harvesting, composting, and
agro ecological crop selection by considering crops
that have a comparative advantage in a particular
area. Extension agents play a key role in supporting
the adoption of improved farming practices and
adaptive coping techniques through practical on-farm
demonstrations.
The Kenya Department of Agriculture (KDA) organizes
demonstration plots of crops that have comparative
advantage in the agro ecological area, for instance,
sunflower in Mbita and Suba Sub Counties, maize in
the upper parts of the County such as Karachuonyo.
These demonstration farms are located within the
40 wards of the County vary in sizes from 0.25 acres
(banana), 0.5 acres (pineapple) and 1 acre (maize,
sorghum, sunflower). In these model farms, the KDA
is providing inputs and capacity building to farmers.
However, the challenge is the high farmer-to-staff
ratio, which is at 1 to 1600 farmers.
Caritas Homa Bay is involved in capacity building of
farmers to enable local-lead research. Other non-
governmental organizations such as ICIPE are also
involved in extension services and farmer field days,
farmer field schools (FFS) and farmer teachers. The
KLD also provides extension services and training and
disseminates livestock technologies.
The Adaptation to Climate Change insurance program
and the Weather-Based Index insurance introduced in
the County ended in 2014. The uptake by farmers was
poor. Some farmers felt that the services offered by
insurance companies were unfavourable. For instance,
fish farmers preferred that the engine of the boat
should be insured in the waters and not on-shore.
As the risk of the former is higher than the latter, the
insurance companies were not willing to insure thus
few farmers bought the premiums.
The various cooperatives that focus on production
and marketing for different value chains often assume
responsibility for providing market information for their
members, as well as linking farmers to direct buyers or
markets. Such cooperatives include AMCS, LPVCCS,
Rangwe Dairy Cooperative Society (RDCS) and Homa
Bay County Peanut Value Chain Cooperative Society
(PVCCS). The cooperatives and farmer groups
such as Ogongo Development Group are engaged
in promotion, pricing and linking farmers to the
buyers. However, the information regarding markets
and marketing channels is weak and not uniformly
distributed across the County.
The main storage facilities in the County are cribs
(75%) and gunny bags (24%). Silos are used mostly
by the NCPB in their mini depot in Magunga. The
rudimentary method of food storage has led to several
cases of aflatoxin contamination (GoK, 2013). Caritas
of Homa Bay is actively involved in post-harvest
handling techniques such as the use of sawdust and
solar dryers. A small percentage of the farmers use
metal silos. The County government is also involved
in the provision of cooler boxes to the BMU along the
riparian areas for safe storage of fish produce before
it is sold.
The capacity to deliver relevant and timely information
to farmers throughout the County is constrained by
coordination, infrastructure, and resource constraints
and must be managed through collaborative efforts
with the key stakeholders.

Adapting agriculture to changes and variabilities in climate:
strategies across major value chain commodities

22 Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series
Policies are key considerations for agriculture decision-
making, since they affect actions and outcomes related
to resource use. Several programs aimed at broadly
addressing the topics related to climate vulnerabilities
have been put in place through the collaboration of local,
national, international, governmental, nongovernmental,
private and faith-based organizations and the community
at large.
The Environmental Management and Coordination Act
(EMCA) of 1999 was amended in 2015, including climate
change considerations on the agenda. It guides ministries
to consider climate change mitigation measures in their
actions and budgets, requesting the establishment of
environmental departments or designated officers in each
County.
The Climate Change Act, 2016 provides a framework for
funding operation and mitigation of climate change issues
both at the national and at the county level. The National
government has held several stakeholder meetings with the
county government to domesticate the act.
The Forest Act of 2005 contains several innovative
solutions to rehabilitate degraded sites and support the
planting of trees nationwide. There is a strong emphasis
on partnerships, the engagement of local communities,
and promotion of private investment. KFS Homabay
cooperates with the farmers groups and communities to
implement activities related to forestry, climate change,
forest conservation and environment. The Forest Act
acknowledges forest community associations as important
partners in forest management. The challenge with
regards to the implementation and adoption is the lack of
community participation.
The Kenya Veterinary Policy provides for an enabling
environment for safeguarding animal life, health and welfare
as well as animal propagation and production for food
security and economic development. Homa Bay County
aims to implement this policy to boost contribution of the
animal component to food security and ensure that animal
products (consumed or marketed) meet the highest safety
and nutritional standards. Through the KLD, the County
engages in inspection of the slaughtered livestock so as to
ensure that diseases, disease- causing and disease-carrying
agents are not transmitted between animals and humans.
Fisheries Management and Development Act, 2016
provides for the conservation, management and
development of the fisheries and other aquatic resources
to enhance the livelihood of communities that depend on
the fishing.
Homa Bay County has a number of climate risk
management programs which are spearheaded by
various institutions. One such example is the Agricultural
Environmental Program implemented by Caritas Homa
Bay, which comprises two components. The Integrated
Food Security initiatives aims at integrating food security
approaches with health (especially HIV/AIDS considering
that the County has a high incidence of HIV/AIDS of 27.1%
[GoK, 2013]) in three Sub Counties: Rangwe, Ndhiwa and
Homa Bay. The initiative engages farmers in a farmers´
research network and use a participatory approach to help
farmers with agricultural research. Farmers also receive
training on post-harvest handling techniques, such as the
use of the sawdustvvv and solar dryers. Caritas also provides
seeds to resource-poor farmers and was involved in the
testing of 12 varieties of sorghum to identify adaptable
varieties. Caritas also offers local improved male goats to
the communities to improve breeds and dairy production
– goat milk is believed to have important nutrients for the
HIV/AIDS patients – and facilitates the construction of
poultry units for farmers.
As part of the Climate Change component of the program,
farmers receive training on conservation agriculture
techniques such as minimum/zero tillage, crop rotation
and permanent cover using dolly corns, pigeon peas,
groundnuts. Caritas engages in tree planting campaigns
and holds demonstrations in schools and churches, along
introducing farmers to drought-tolerant crops such as
cassava, sorghum and early-maturing varieties of beans.
In close collaboration with other stakeholders such as GIZ,
MoALF and Sustainable East Africa (SEA), they provide
seed relief.
The dissemination of push-pull technology by ICIPE
developed in collaboration with other partners addresses
the five key constraints of cereal–livestock mixed production
systems in Africa – insect pests (stem borers), the parasitic
striga weed  (as well as other weeds), poor soil fertility, soil
moisture management, while also fulfilling the need for
high quality animal feed. The push-pull technology involves
intercropping cereals with a pest-repellent plant, such as
desmodium, which drives away stem borers from the target
food crop. An attractant trap plant, for instance Napier grass
(Pennisetum purpureum), is planted around the border of
this intercrop, with the purpose of attracting and trapping
the pests. As a result, the food crop is left protected from
the pests. In addition, desmodium stimulates suicidal
germination of Striga and inhibits its growth. Push-pull also
has significant benefits for dairy farming, since silverleaf
desmodium and Napier grass are both high quality animal
fodder plants. Additionally, desmodium is an efficient
nitrogen-fixing legume that improves soil fertility. Moreover,
because both plants are perennial, push–pull conserves soil
moisture and continually improves soil health.
Policies and Programmes

23
Homa Bay County
Governance, institutional
resources, and capacity
Like programs and policies, institutions are key to
agriculture decision-making, since they shape actions
and outcomes related to resource use. In agriculture,
institutions’ roles can be related to the design of policies
and investment frameworks (government’s), knowledge
development and sharing (research institutes, universities),
technological development (research institutes, farmer
associations) or the delivery of financial and non-financial
incentives for agricultural investments (credit institutions,
trust funds) (FAO, 2010).  In Homa Bay, there is a wide
range of institutions, ranging from governmental to non-
governmental to the faith-based organizations and the
private sector, that are actively involved in climate-related
issues. Some of the most prominent institutions are
discussed below.
The KMD generates seasonal forecasts through data
analysis and workshops held with key stakeholders,
integrating scientific and traditional knowledge. Through
participatory scenario planning the experts develop an
information dissemination plan that may include sharing
through the ASDSP environmental resilient officers, and
radio.
The Kenya Forest Service (KFS) is a semi-autonomous
government parastatal. KFS Homa Bay cooperates with
farmer groups and the community to implement activities
related to climate change, forestry, farm and dry land forestry,
forest conservation and environment. The role of the KFS
The ASDSP is a programme funded by the Government
of Kenya and the Swedish government whose objective
is to transform Kenya’s agriculture into an innovative,
commercial-oriented modern industry and alleviate
poverty and improve food security. The role of ASDSP in
Homa Bay County includes facilitation and coordination
of participatory scenario planning with key stakeholders
and dissemination through vernacular radio stations
(Ramogi, Sunset) and barazaas, churches, as well as value
addition development, where the key value chains include
indigenous poultry, fish and sorghum.
The Accelerated Dairy Value Chain  Project aims to
transform the livestock in the County through vaccination
against ECF and the synchronized  artificial insemination.
The County provides the first 4000 straws for free. So far,
2,000 straws have been administered. The approach is
demand driven and at the moment the key beneficiaries
are RDCS,Homabay,Kasipul and Kabondo Kasipul.
This project is an initiative by the county Government of
Homabay and ILRI.
is to rehabilitate degraded sites and planting of trees. The
percentage of the land under forest cover in the County is
only 2.6% compared to the national forest cover of 6.9%.
This is far from constitutional requirement. KFS joined the
initiative to rehabilitate three hills: Asego hills, Samenya hills
and Unga hills (project sponsored by the World Bank and
implemented by Lake Victoria Environmental Management
Program [LVEMP]). KFS works with various community
groups and farmer groups in carrying out their mandate.
The activities of self-help groups is also important in the
County. Abba Self-help group works in Kochia, advising
farmers on the importance of trees. In Okundi Valley they
have collaborated with local communities to rehabilitate
the valley. Other self-help groups include but are not limited
to: Ngegu BMU, KK self-help group, Werigu women group
(actively involved in afforestation), Star of the Lake, and the
Nyamauru Bamako Initiative. All these groups were funded
by the LVEMP Phase 2.
KFS has partnered with the Biotechnology Department in
Karura for about 70,000 hybrid seedlings that are adaptive
and suitable for Homa Bay County. They sell the hybrids
to the community at KES 20 per seedling. KFS has also
collaborated with the Lake Basin Development Authority
(LBDA) in the rehabilitation of Rangwe hill, where more than
5,000 seedlings were planted. However, there is resistance
by the community in the adoption of tree planting as it is
not self-driven. A lot of persuasion is needed to plant the
trees, curtailing KFS´ key objective of KFS to increase the
forest cover in the County. Lack of adequate resources and
human capacity is also a major concern in carrying out
these interventions.
NEMA is the N.I.E of the adaptation to climate change
funds. The authority has been working with the world
vision to implement climate change resilience program
in Lambwe on the natural regeneration capacity. It has
coordinated with FES to create awareness , It educates
farmers on the importance of tree planting through their
County Environmental Action Plans (CEAP). NEMA is
also promoting green growth concept through green
points which promote sustainable use of resources
including innovations in the agricultural sector. It also
trains the farmers on disaster preparedness and is part of
the management committee at the County Government.
However, lack of adequate human resources and funding
curtails its operations. Likewise with KFS, there is resistance
from communities with regards to tree planting.
The ICIPE Thomas Odhiambo Campus (ITOC), located
in Mbita Point, was established in 1977, as a base for the
Centre’s research in the region. ITOC provides infrastructure
for basic and applied laboratory and field-based biological
and sociological research, as well as facilities for the
development, testing and dissemination of environmentally-

24 Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series
Synthesis and Outlook
Climate risks have detrimental impacts on the lives of
the population of Homa Bay County, including famine
experienced in the lowland AEZs (LM2, LM3, LM4 and LM
5), losses of crops and livestock and depletion of fish stock.
Farmers traditionally use their indigenous knowledge to
adapt to climate change. Some of the most widely used
safe and sustainable pest- and vector-management
technologies in various agro-ecological zones. Research
activities at ITOC cover four themes: human, animal, plant
and environmental health. In particular, ITOC is the base of
ICIPE´s push-pull technology.
Currently, the main dissemination pathways are farmer
field days, farmer field schools (FFS), farmer teachers, print
materials, extension personnel, and to a lesser extent, mass
media.
The Forest Social Initiative (FSI) specializes in dryland species
for charcoal production and. It is based in Magunga, where
FSI promotes acacia species, as these are suitable species
for this very dry area. However, community participation in
this initiative is weak. World vision has worked with different
stakeholders in Homabay county in initiatives such as
planting trees to manage the climate change risks in
Homabay. However, the institution is financially constrained
in implementing its mandate considering that the needs of
the county are way to many.
With the support of cooperatives, farmers can pool
production from their individual farms in order to better
meet market demand, reduce risk, access better financing
acquire and share farm machinery and other assets,
negotiate better prices, and jointly market their produce.
Cooperatives in the County vary in size and influence. Some
of the cooperatives in the agricultural activities include
AMCS, LPVCCS, RDCS, and PVCS. The cooperatives and
the farmer groups such as Ogongo Development Group
are engaged in promotion, pricing and linking farmers to
the buyers. However, the cooperatives and farmer groups
are not well structured and not well coordinated, limiting
their activities.
Private sector actors are also key actors. Agro-veterinary
companies engage in the distribution and sale of agro-
chemicals and other farm inputs and often train farmers on
the safe utilization of pesticides, fertilisers and other input
supplies. Financial institutions such as banks provide loans
to farmers. These are not specifically agricultural loans, but
general loans that farmers use to purchase production and
storage inputs. The extent to which such formal financial
institutions are accessible and used by farmers is not clear.
on-farm strategies include: tree planting, improved soil and
water conservation, adaptation of early-maturing varieties
and water harvesting, post-harvest handling, value adding
processing, among others. However, integration with
scientific knowledge can be improved to ensure effective
adaptation to changing climate conditions.
The majority of farmers rely on rain-fed agriculture which
is unreliable in Homa Bay County in particular in the warm
and dry low AEZs (LM2, LM3, LM4 and LM5). Opportunities
include water harvesting for crop and livestock production,
development of irrigation schemes to increase yields
during the dry seasons through smallholder irrigation
schemes and through Public-Private Partnership &
collaboration. Water harvesting and promotion of efficient
water-use technologies (drip irrigation, green house), and
conservation agriculture is key for these AEZs. There is also
a need for promotion and production of drought-tolerant
crops such as millet, sorghum, green gram to cope with
the recurrent climate shock experienced in these zones.
Expensive farm inputs limit agricultural productivity in
the County, as most of the farmers are not in a position
to afford the expensive inputs. This is further exacerbated
by climate risks resulting in scarcity, high demand and
consequently higher prices of inputs. Farmers in the lower
AEZs (LM2, LM3, LM4 and LM5) are more vulnerable to
adverse climatic conditions. Organization of farmers into
groups/ cooperatives would facilitate access to inputs,
credit, and markets and would increase the likelihood of
better process.
Homa Bay County has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS
(27.1%) leading to high morbidity. There is a strong
correlation between health and productivity. Thus, there
is an urgent need to tackle the high incidence of the HIV/
AIDS that is particularly affecting the fish value chain. This
can be achieved through mass campaigns where the key
stakeholders need to be involved.
Farmers in Homa Bay County experience post-harvest
losses due to rudimentary storage methods. Over 90% of
farmers use traditional production and storage methods
which limit their output. Only a minority (1%) uses silos.
There is a need to adopt adequate storage facilities and
technologies such as hermetic bags, community grain
and input storage facilities, alongside the promotion
of agro processing. This effort needs to be the result of
collaboration of various stakeholders, including research
institutions,
financial
institutions,
relevant
County
department, community and individual farmers. Such
efforts wound lead to reduced post-harvest losses and
increase the value of the produce and the trading prices
on the market.

Regarding distribution and marketing, inadequate and
insufficient markets and outlets where farmers can sell their
produce, coupled with limited processing or value adding
opportunities can be counteracted with the development
of farmer groups, market infrastructure and processing
plants that can help meet the demand and increase the
value of products. In order for this to occur, access to
timely, accurate information (especially market-related) is
crucial for farmers and the business community. Climate
change Act, 2016 provides a framework for promoting
climate resilience. There is the need to downscale this to
the county level so as to manage the climate change risks.
