Soils and climate

Maize grows best on deep, well-drained, fertile soils, and where total seasonal rainfall exceeds
500 mm. Maize is reasonably tolerant to soil acidity, but if the soil is very acid, liming will
improve the soil and enhance maize yields. Maize is susceptible to both drought and water-
logging. Thus, poorly drained soils should be avoided, unless practices like ridge tillage,
drainage and early planting are employed. Drought during the four week period spanning
flowering (silking and tasseling) can cause serious yield losses, and therefore some form of water
conservation is important (e.g., pot-holing, mulching, tied-ridges), especially in the drier areas.
Temperatures above 38 degrees celcius affect yield by affaceting pollen viability while
temperatures below 10 retards maize growth.

Fertilisation

The fertiliser requirements of maize depends on the soil fertility and yield target. Infertile soils
require more fertiliser, as does a higher yield target. The two most important nutrients for maize
are nitrogen and phosphorous, but maize also requires potassium and, on some soils, Zinc in
small quantities. The first consideration for fertilising maize is manure, for it is an excellent
source of nutrients and has many other benefits for soils. Bought inorganic fertilisers should be
considered as a supplement to manure. The following table gives a general recommendation for
fertilising maize with inorganic fertilisers:

Facts:

 The yield potential largely depends on the variety, expected rainfall and on the
management applied to the crop.

 The addition of manure and ash will greatly improve the response of maize to the applied
fertiliser. Under commercial set ups addition of lime to acidic soils improve response to
fertilisers

 Fertiliser rates may be reduced after a drought, where manure and ash is applied or when
the maize is following a legume or well-fertilised crop, like potatoes.

4

 The basal fertiliser must be applied before or at the time of planting, preferably cupped
into the planting hole, or applied in a band below and to the side of the seed with the
mechanical planter.

 The top dressing should be applied when the maize at 3.5 to 6 Weeks After crop
Emergence-WACE.
 Top dressing splits may be recommended in sandy to sandy loam soils. A maximum of 3
usually is ideal

 Basal fertilisers which contains zinc are recommended for application every two to three
years on sandy soils.

 If boronated fertilisers are not normally applied as part of the rotation, then a boronated
fertiliser should be applied every three years.

The approximate application rates (to the nearest half-bag) of inorganic

fertilisers to crops can be determined from the following tables:

NOTE:

 1 ha =2.5 acres

 1 bag of fertiliser = 50kg

 To convert kg/ha to bags per hectare, divide by 100 and multiply by 2.

 To convert kg/ha to kg per acre, divide by 2.5 (or multiply by 0.4).

 Specific amounts of fertilizer will vary according to the specific density of the fertilizer
used.

Plant spacing

The width of rows and the spacing of plants in the row determines the plant population. The
closer the spacing, the more plants there will be per unit area. The recommended number of
maize plants per hectare varies from 36,000 to 60,000, depending on the environmental yield
potential and hybrid. High plant populations are appropriate for early-planted crops under high
rainfall or irrigated conditions where management is of a good standard. Lower plant populations

7

should be used under dryland conditions, especially in drought prone areas, where a population
of about 37,000 to 40, 000 plants per hectare is recommended. Some varieties may be susceptible
to lodging under high plant populations. Generally, the taller the variety, the lower should be the
plant population. Short maize varieties may be grown at higher plant populations. Whatever the
case, the minimum plant population for maize is 36,000 plants per ha.

A seed rate of about 25 kg/ha is required, but this depends on the seed size. 10 kg is enough to
plant 1 acre and 5 kg for half an acre. Small seed will go further, and give equal germination and
yield performance as large seed. However, small seed should not be planted too deep (i.e., not
deeper than 5 cm). For SC 727, a 50, 000 kernel (1 hectare pack) is enough to plant 1 Ha, 20, 000
kernel for 1 Acre.

NB: To derive your population per hectare divide 10,000 by your row spacing (m) and then
divide the answer by the spacing between the plant stations in metres. Multiply the answer by the

New trends in population density management-commercial
Some farmers are pushing their population density higher than the recommended in search for
„compensatory yield increases‟. The farmers are targeting populations densities such as 65 000,
70 000, 80 000 up to 100 000 are being achieved. The trend or condition is that the farmers are
coming in with a growth regulator such as CeCeCe (@ 2.1l/Ha) and Ethrel before day 35 after
emergence. However this comes at a cost in terms extra seed cost, extra compensatory
fertilization, spraying cost, and risk of response failure especially when spraying times coincides
with extended wet periods.
There is need for further research especially the whether the yield gains are significant (or if they
do exist in the first place), profitability of this concept, breeding for short statured but high
yielding varieties to accommodate high densities. However we recommend optimum population
densities of 50 000 to 60 000 plants per Ha on all Seed Co varieties in Zimbabwe.
Planting date

The later maize is planted, the lower the yield, as shown in the graph below. Highest yields are
obtained with October plantings, but these can usually only be sustained with irrigation (ie
irrigation to establish crop). However, planting in October may be feasible on vleis or when there
is good early rain (over 50mm). November planting with the onset of the first rains is the safest
under dryland conditions. In order to exploit these early rains, fields need to be ready before the
rains (i.e. in October) and seed and fertiliser must be on hand, so that as soon as the first rains
fall, fields may be planted. Planting in December will produce low yields, and is very risky,
because the crop may suffer from drought stress at the end of the season, while pests (e.g. stalk
borer) and diseases (maize streak virus and HT) are more prevalent on late planted crops. Under
rainfed situations, after second week of November a farmer is encouraged to dry plant anyway at
a depth of about 5 cm to ensure the seed is not reached by light showers.

13

On average, for every day that planting is delayed, the yield loss is one bag (50 kg) per ha. This
is a significant loss and something to be remembered by those who wish to be productive
farmers. Early planting with the right Seed Co maize hybrid, together with fertiliser and manure
and the control of early weeds will make a large difference to the productivity of farmers' fields.

Varietal choice

The choice of variety depends on the yield potential, season length, anticipated disease problems
and use. The Seed Co Product Manual gives descriptions and recommendations of all the Seed
Co hybrids on the market. It is best to study that manual and determine
which hybrid will be best for each situation.

Considerations when choosing maize hybrid varieties
 amount and distribution of rainfall
 length of the growing season
 altitude and air temperature
 soil fertility and fertiliser application
 planting date
 plant density

14

 use (commercial grain, green mealie and silage)
 occurrence of pests and diseases
 management

Pointer!

Always plant new certified Seed Co
seed each year for maximum yields.

Early maturing hybrids take between 120 and 140 days from planting to maturity, whereas
medium to late maturing varieties take between 141 and 155 days to mature. However the time
to maturity for any variety depends on air temperature: the cooler the temperatures the longer the
plants will take to mature. Seed Co Limited has a very simple way of differentiating their hybrids
using animal symbols as given in the accompanying table.

[Put brochure here]

The range of hybrids available from Seed Co is continuously changing as we develop new
hybrids with improved performance and disease tolerance. Therefore, it is important to keep
oneself informed by attending field days and reading adverts.
It is a good idea to grow more than one maize hybrid on a farm. Approximately half the fields
should be planted to a familiar variety that is most suited to your environment, one quarter to an
earlier maturing hybrid and one quarter to a later maturing hybrid. Start planting with the later
maturing hybrid and end with the earlier maturing hybrid. Also consider trying out a small area
of one or two new hybrids to compare their performance with hybrids you know.
Altitude has an effect on the number of days from planting to flowering and maturity because the
rate of development of maize is affected by air temperature. The warmer the weather, the faster
crop development is. Higher temperatures at lower altitudes therefore have the effect of
accelerating the development rate. Conversely, the lower air temperatures at higher altitudes
retard development and extend the time taken to reach flowering and maturity. The graph below

gives a rough guide as to the time from planting to maturity for the four groups of Seed Co maize
hybrids:

Planting

16

Maize yield declines as planting is delayed after the first week of November. Therefore plant as
early as possible. For hand planting, this may be achieved if the farmer is well prepared. The
following guidelines help plan an early planting:

 Obtain fertiliser and seed in September or earlier.

 Prepare planting holes early (i.e., in August or September) and cup-in the compound
fertiliser so that all fields are ready for planting by the end of October.

 It is unwise to plant in October, unless substantial rain has been received (i.e., more than
50 mm rain (within 3 days) and the soil is wet down to 45 cm on clays and 60 cm on
sands).

 In November, after each rainfall event, check the soil moisture status by digging in the
field. Sow seed if the soil is wet down to 30 cm on clay soils or 50 cm on sandy soils. If
more than 25 mm of rain has fallen, plant as much as you can in two days and then stop
until further rain is received.

 If no planting rains have fallen by the second week of November, then dry plant. Ensure
the seed is placed into dry soil at a depth of 5-6cm.

 In all planting operations ensure the seed is well covered with loose soil and pressed, so
as to achieve good seed-soil contact. Avoid covering the seed with clods or rocks.

 Soaking seeds in water for 12 hours (overnight) hastens germination, but such seed must
be planted into wet soil the day after soaking. However with this practice farmers
should note that they will be washing away the fungicides and pesticides which are
normally used to treat certified seed. These prevents early disease and pest infestations.

17

Mid-season management
1. Weed control, especially in the first 10 weeks after crop emergence is essential. Hoeing is
effective, and is easiest when weeds are small and on small portions. However, if the fields are
bigger enough and your management is good, herbicides are recopmmended. There is a wide
selection of pre-emergence herbicides for maize, but a common combination is
Alachlor/Metalachlor and Atrazine applied pre-emergence. When applying herbicides, read and
follow the label instructions and take the necessary safety precautions.

2. Rain-harvesting techniques should be employed as early as possible, e.g., mulching, pot-
holing, tied-ridging or wet ripping. This is particularly beneficial in the dry areas where rainfall
is unreliable.

3. Top dress with Ammonium Nitrate/Urea when the maize is 4 to 6 weeks old. Maize on
sandy soils may require a split top-dressing, with the first half applied at 4 weeks and the second
at 7 weeks after emergence. Use appropriate sized fertiliser cups to place the fertiliser near each
plant, or dribble-band the fertiliser along the row with a suitably calibrated pipe attached to a bag
(chola). Fertiliser applicators are recommended to band top dressing fertilizer on the interrows.
These can be calibrated and adjusted depending on the intended rates.

4. Check for stalk borer damage at 4 to 6 weeks after planting. The characteristic evidence of
early infection of stalk borer is the appearance of numerous small holes in the new leaves in the
funnel. If necessary apply insecticide granules or sprays into the funnels of the maize plants to
control stalkborers. It is important to control the first generation of stalkborers, otherwise a
second generation may develop which will be more numerous and difficult to control.
5. Start to check for Fall Army Worm damage at 2 to 3 weeks after planting and make spraying
decisions early before damage reaches economic levels. Leaves show typical bullet-shot holes
and leaves dry horse manure-like droppings called frass on the leaves particularly the central
whorl. Leaves show a typical “window pane” damage. The damage includes holes on the stem
causing significant stalk lodge, the cob and the tassel.

18

6. Control late weeds with the hoe or herbicides from flowering onwards, as this reduces weed
pressure, weed seed reservoirs, and also makes the harvesting operation easier.

7. Harvest the crop as early as possible to reduce in-field losses. If whole cobs are harvested
and placed in an outside grain crib for storage until shelling, protect this from rain. Shell the cobs
as soon as possible to minimise infection by weevils. Store the grain when it is dry and protect it
from insects and rodents. The best place for grain storage is a cool dry room that prohibits the
entry of moisture and rodents. The application of a grain protectant chemical will prevent
infection by weevils and other storage pests.
Hard facts about weeds in maize

 The annual yield loss in maize as a result of weed problems can reach 50% or more
 The crop must have a good head start ahead of weeds
 The crop must be weed free for the first 10 weeks of the crop cycle after crop emergence
 This is the most critical time when the crop requires at least 50% of the nutrients and
hence must be weed free
 If you fail to control weeds in maize in the first 5 weeks of the crop cycle, then 50% of
the yields will be lost.
 Never allow weeds to seed, it will enhance the weed seed bank and result in future weed
control costs increases and difficulties.
 There are more than 20 herbicides registered in Zimbabwe which can be sprayed on
maize crop. The choice is very wide!
Yield forecasting in maize
Steps:
•
Walk the land to ensure that the stand is even, standing (not lodging) and has no many gaps
•
Reap the cobs from a measured 20 sq. metres. If the rows are at 90cm, then you should reap
22m row length, if the rows are 75cm, then measure 26.6m row length.
•
Shell the cobs, weigh the grain and determine the moisture content using a moisture meter
•
Do this for three or four separate samples at widely separate points and determine the
average

19

•
Use the formula below to calculate yield average estimate corrected to 1 ha and to 12.5%
Moisture Content
•
Mass Grain (Kg) x (100-moisture content)/ (100-12.5) x10 000/20
NB: The formula automatically correct the final yield to 12.5% moisture content
