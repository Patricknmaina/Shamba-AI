1. General Information and Agronomic Aspects
Cassava typically grows as a shrub. Cassava is native of Latin America and was introduced
to the African continent by Portuguese traders in the late 16th century.
Cassava is grown on an estimated 80 million hectares in 34 African countries. It is an important
crop in subsistence farming, as it requires few production skills or inputs. It is drought tolerant
and produces reasonable yields under adverse conditions. Most important is its ability to remain
in the soil as a famine reserve. Other factors that make cassava popular with small-scale farmers,
particularly in Africa, are that it requires little labour in its production and there are
no labour peaks because the necessary operations in its production can be spread throughout the
year, and its yields fluctuate less than those of cereals.
The storage root (some people refer to it as "tuber") is a major source of energy and the leaves,
which contain a high level of vitamin A and up to 17% protein, are often used as green
vegetables. Its limitations are its poor nutritive value (mainly carbohydrates) and its cyanogenic

glucoside content (HCN) that can lead to poisoning unless precautions (proper peeling/soaking in
water/fermenting/drying/cooking) are taken during preparation of the tubers. The latter is only
applicable to bitter cassava varieties. Sweet varieties can even be eaten raw and fresh as they
have very low content of HCN.
The main diseases affecting cassava are African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), cassava
bacterial blight, cassava anthracnose, and root rot. Pests and diseases, in combination with poor
agronomic practices cause high yield losses in Africa. While biological and chemical control
practices are available for other pests and diseases attacking cassava, ACMV is difficult to
control. In severe cases, plants become stunted. In fact, this disease can cause up to 60% yield
loss, and no biological or chemical control is now available to farmers. Given the vegetative
propagation method used for cassava, availability of clean planting material for propagation is a
major constraint, since white flies and infested planting material transmit the disease.
While cassava production demands few external inputs, labour and planting material are main
costs of production. As a root crop, cassava requires a lot of labour to harvest. The production of
cassava is dependent on a supply of good quality stem cuttings. The multiplication rate of these
vegetative planting materials is very low, compared to grain crops, which are propagated by true
seeds. Post harvest deterioration of cassava is a major constraint. Cassava stem cuttings are bulky
and highly perishable, drying up within a few days. Consequently, roots must be processed into a
storable form soon after harvest. Farmers recognise post harvest loss as a major risk factor in
cassava production. Nevertheless, the rapid post harvest perishability might lead to comparative
disadvantages for small-scale producers linked to small-scale processing units.
Furthermore, many cassava varieties contain cyanogenic glucosides, and inadequate processing
can lead to high toxicity. Various processing methods, such as grating, sun drying, and
fermenting, are used to reduce the cyanide content.

Propagation and planting
Propagation from storage roots is impossible, as the roots have no buds. Cassava is propagated
through cuttings. The most suitable cuttings are 20-30 cm long and 20-25 mm in diameter (with
5-8 nodes), preferably from the middle browned-skinned portion of the stems of plants 8-14
months old. Cuttings from older, more mature parts of the stem give better yield than cuttings
from younger parts, and long cuttings give higher yields than short cuttings. Select cuttings from
healthy plants. Cuttings slightly infested with pests can be treated by immersion in heated water
(mixing equal volumes of boiling and cold water) for 5-10 minutes just before planting.
The interval between cutting stems and planting should be as short as possible (not more than a
couple of days). Cassava cuttings may be planted vertically, at an angle, or horizontally. The
drier the soil the bigger the part of the stem placed in the soil. Under very dry conditions, plant
cuttings at an angle and cover the larger part with soil. Vertical planting is best in sandy soils, as
the roots develop deeper in the soil. Horizontal planting leads to a large number of thin stems,
which may cause lodging. Moreover, the roots develop more closely to the surface and are more
likely to be exposed and attacked by rodents and birds. Do not plant cuttings upside down, as this
drastically reduces yield.
The spacing between plants will depend on whether cassava is grown as a sole crop or with other
crops (intercropping). If cassava is being grown alone, plants should be planted 1 meter apart
from each other. This means that 10.000 cuttings are required for 1 ha (4000 cuttings per acre). If
cassava is being grown as an intercrop, the branching habit of both the cassava and the other
crops should be considered, making sure there is enough space for the plants.
The best land for planting cassava is flat or gently sloping land. Steep slopes are easily eroded.
Valleys and depression areas that usually get waterlogged are not very suitable and cassava roots
do not develop well. Before planting get to know the history of the land (previous crops, types of
weeds, diseases and pests).
Soil preparation varies from practically zero under shifting cultivation to ploughing, harrowing
and possible ridging in more intensive cropping systems. Planting on mounds and ridges is
recommended, especially for areas with rainfall of more than 1200 mm per year or in areas
where soils get waterlogged (e.g. valleys and depressions). Ridging may not give higher yield,
but harvesting is easier and soil erosion may be reduced, especially by contoured ridges. In sandy
soils, minimum tillage and planting cassava on the flat are appropriate. Plant at the beginning of
the rainy season.
Husbandry
Weeding is necessary every 3-4 weeks until 2-3 months after planting. Afterwards the canopy
may cover the soil and weeding is less necessary. Although cassava grows rather well on poor
soils, it requires large amount of nutrients to produce high yields. To maintain high yields, it is

necessary to maintain the fertility of the soil. Phosphorous is important for root development.
Symptoms of phosphorous deficiency are stunted growth and violet or purple discolouration of
the leaves. In the absence of good compost, rock phosphate can be applied if needed. Potassium
is also needed by cassava and can be applied in the form of compost or wood ashes. Potassium
deficiency symptoms are: stunted growth, dark leaf colour which gradually becomes paler, dry
brown spots on tips and margins of the leaves and "burnt" edges of leaves.
Fertilizers and manures are usually not used by small-scale cassava growers in most African
countries because, in many cases, they cannot afford such additional inputs. However, it is
important to provide good growing conditions for the plants, as healthy plants are able to
withstand some damage by pests and diseases. In general, cassava responds well to farmyard
manure. Manure can be applied at land preparation to increase soil nutrients, to improve the soil
structure, and to improve the ability of the soil to hold water.
Mulching cassava, especially after planting, is helpful when growing cassava in dry areas or on
slopes.
Crop rotation and intercropping
There is a wide variety of cropping patterns and rotations with cassava. Though rotation with
other crops is preferable, cassava is sometimes grown continuously on the same land, especially
in dry areas not suitable for other crops. When grown in bush-fallow systems, cassava is usually
planted at the end of the rotation cycle, as it still produces relatively well at lower fertility levels
and also allows a smooth transition to the fallow.
Cassava when planted as an intercrop along with cowpea groundnut or tree crops
like Leucaena reduces soil run-off and soil-loss. Forage yield of Leucaena improves when grown
with cassava and groundnut. Canavalia or Crotalaria (legume crops) when planted as intercrops
with cassava improves soil productivity.
Sow 1 row of Canavalia or Crotalaria between rows of cassava immediately after planting
cassava. Let these grow until harvest. Plough after harvest to incorporate crop residues into the
soil.
Harvesting
Harvesting is done either piece-meal or by uprooting whole plants. Young plants are usually
harvested piece-meal, while old plants are more commonly uprooted to prevent the storage roots
becoming very fibrous. As cassava roots do not keep fresh more than 2-3 days after harvesting,
not all plants are harvested at once, but rather harvesting as the roots are consumed. When
cassava is grown for urban markets they are harvested in bulk. Cassava is usually harvested 9-12
months after planting. It is sometimes harvested earlier if needed for food. Storage roots become

too woody if harvesting is delayed. Early maturing varieties are ready for harvesting at 6 months
while late maturing varieties are ready 12 months after planting.
Storage
Cassava does not store well when fresh and therefore has to be peeled, chopped and dried in the
sun. It can then be stored in the form of chips or flour under dry conditions.
Average yields are between 3-4 tons of fresh tubers per acre (7.5-10 tons per ha) although with
reasonable care and attention yields of up to 10 tons per acre (25 tons per ha) and more are
possible. The ratio of fresh tubers to peeled and dried chips is about 3:1.
Marketing
Manual from IITA  Starting a cassava farm  Of the world production of cassava, 65% is used
directly for human consumption, 20% for animal feed and the remaining 15% for starch and
industrial uses (alcohol production). In Africa, stems are often used as firewood.
Climate conditions, soil and water management
In equatorial areas, cassava can be grown up to 1500 m altitude. The optimum temperature range
is 20-30deg. Specific cultivars are necessary for successful cultivation at an average temperature
of 20deg. Cassava is grown in regions with 500-6000 mm of rainfall per year. Optimum annual
rainfall is 1000-1500 mm, without distinct dry periods. Once established, cassava can resist
severe drought. With prolonged periods of drought, cassava plants shed their leaves but resume
growth after the rains start, making it a suitable crop in areas with uncertain rainfall distribution.
Because of its drought resistance, in many regions cassava is planted as a reserve crop against
famine in dry years. Good drainage is essential for cassava; the crop does not tolerate water
logging. High irradiance is preferred.
Best growth and yield are obtained on fertile sandy loams. Cassava is able to produce reasonable
yields on severely depleted or even eroded soils where other crops fail. Gravelly or stony soils
cause problems with root penetration and are unsuitable. Also heavy clay or other poorly drained
soils are not suitable.
Cassava growth and yield are reduced drastically on saline soils and on alkaline soils with a pH
above 8.0. The optimum pH is between 5.5 and 7.5, but cultivars are available that tolerate a pH
as low as 4.6 or as high as 8.0. Reasonably salt-tolerant cultivars have also been selected. Very
fertile soils encourage excessive foliage growth at the expense of storage roots.

2. Information on Pests
Furthermore, many cassava varieties contain cyanogenic glucosides, and inadequate processing
can lead to high toxicity. Various processing methods, such as grating, sun drying, and
fermenting, are used to reduce the cyanide content.
Cassava mealybug (Phenacoccus manihoti)
The cassava mealybug is pinkish in colour. Its body is surrounded by very short filaments, and
covered with a fine coating of wax. Adults are 0.5-1.4 mm long. This mealybug does not have
males. Females live for about 20 days and lay 400 eggs in average. The lifecycle from egg to
adult is completed in about 1 month at 27°C. It reproduces throughout the year and it reaches
peak densities during the dry season. Mealybugs are dispersed by wind and through planting
material.
The cassava mealybug strongly prefers cassava and other Manihot species; other host crops and
wild hosts are only marginally infested. It sucks sap at cassava shoot tips, on the lower surface of
leaves, and on stems. During feeding the mealybug injects a toxin into the cassava plant causing
deformation of terminal shoots, which become stunted, resulting in compression of terminal
leaves into "bunchy tops". The length of internodes is reduced, and stems are distorted. When
attack is severe plants die, starting at the plant tip, where most mealybugs are found.
Mealybug attack results in leaf loss and poor quality planting material (stem cuttings) due to
dieback and weakening of stems used for crop propagation. Tuber losses have been estimated up
to 80%. The pest-induced defoliation reduces availability of healthy leaves, which are consumed
as leafy vegetables in most of West and Central Africa. After the pest cripples plant growth,
weed and erosion sometimes lead to total destruction of the crops. In general, yield losses depend
upon age of plant when attacked, length of dry season, severity of attack and general conditions
of the plant. Mealybug damage is more severe in the dry than in the wet season.
The cassava mealybug was accidentally introduced to Africa from South America. After the first
reports in the 1970s, the insect became the major cassava pest within a few years and spread
rapidly through most of the African cassava belt. The outbreak led to famine in several countries
where cassava is a staple crop and particularly important in times of drought. In an attempt to
control this pest natural enemies, mainly parasitic wasps and ladybird beetles, were introduced
from South America.
The most effective has been the parasitic wasp (Apoanagyrus (=Epidinocarsis) lopezi), which
has kept this mealybug at low levels, resulting on significant reduction of yield losses in most
areas in Africa (Neuenschwander, 2003).

What to do:

Plant early in the rainy season to allow the cassava plants a good growth before the dry
season. Strong plants are more likely to withstand pest attacks.

Use soil amendments and mulch to avoid moisture stress in sandy or poor soils.
Mealybug numbers are higher on cassava grown on poor, sandy soils, and may cause
damage in spite of the presence of natural enemies.

Avoid using infested plant material. Before planting cutting can be treated with hot water
[by immersing them in heated water (mixing equal volumes of boiling and cold water) for
5-10 minutes just before planting] to kill all insects/mites and to avoid transfer into the
newly planted field. For more information on Hot water treatment click here.

Avoid using pesticides on crops surrounding cassava fields. Although, no pesticides are
used on cassava in Africa, insecticide drift from neighbouring fields may affect natural
enemies that keep mealybugs and other pests under control.

Use of manure or other fertilisers can result in a reduction in the mealybug population
because improved nutrition results in the production of larger parasitoid wasps with
higher fertility levels. Mulch and fertilizer use also enhances the antibiotic properties of
cassava against mealybug infestation.

Larger grain borer (Prostephanus truncatus)
The larger grain borer has been found infesting cassava chips in storage particularly during the
rainy season in West Africa. This beetle is currently the most serious pest of dried cassava in
storage. Weight losses as high as 70% after 4 months of storage have been reported elsewhere.

What to do:

Use botanicals or plant parts to protect stored cassava. There are reports in Kenya, that
the larger grain borer can be effectively repelled by storing cassava or grains with a fairly
large amount of dried lantana or eucalyptus leaves (Personal communication, field officer
of Meru herbs). Neem is also reported to be effective.

Birds and other vertebrate pests
Birds, rodents, monkeys, pigs and domestic animals (cattle, goat and sheep) are common
vertebrate pests of cassava.
Measures that help to manage damage by these pests include:
What to do:

Fence farms and set traps in the fence.


Cover exposed roots with soil.

Weed your cassava farm to discourage rodents pests.

Harvest roots as soon as they are mature (James et al., 2000).

Red-Billed Quelae Bird is one of the most dangerous of all agricultural pests in Africa, and
causes food shortages in many countries. The flock breeds at times of abundant rainfall and
young are ready to move with the nomadic flock within six weeks,often coinciding with the
ripening of grain crops. A nesting colony of Red-billed quelea can extend over hundreds of
acres, and a single flock may number millions of birds, moving together in a synchronized
fashion. Recent discussions about quelea bird pest control have started to turn towards prediction
of breeding based on weather patterns

Striped mealybug (Ferrisia virgata)
It is a whitish mealybug with two longitudinal dark stripes, long glassy wax threads and two long
tails. It attains a length of 4 mm. The stripped mealybug occurs on the underside of leaves near
the petioles and on the stems. It sucks sap but does not inject any toxin into plants. Severely
attacked plants show general symptoms of weakening but do not show distortion.
It is a minor pest of cassava, and no control is usually required as is controlled naturally by
natural enemies.
What to do:

Select mealybug-free planting material.

Cassava green spider mite (Mononychellus tanajoa or M. progresivus)
This mite is green in colour at a young age turning yellowish as adult. Adult females attain a size
of 0.8 mm. They appear as yellowish green specks to the naked eye. They occur on the lower
surface of young leaves, green stems and auxiliary buds of cassava. Damage initially appears as
yellowish "pinpricks" on the surface of young leaves.
Symptoms vary from a few chlorotic spots to complete chlorosis. These symptoms are somehow
similar to African cassava mosaic disease, and should not be confused. Heavily attacked leaves
are stunted and become deformed. Severe attacks cause the terminal leaves to die and drop, and
the shoot tip looks like a "candle stick". Green spider mites are major pests in dry season. Severe
mite attack results in 20-80 % loss in tuber yield.
Predatory mites (mainly Typhlodromalus aripo and T. manihoti) introduced from South
America, the home of the cassava green mite, have given effective control of the cassava green
mites in Africa (Yaninek and Hanna, 2003).
What to do:

Whenever possible, use varieties with good tolerance to green mites (Examples from
West Africa: "BEN 86052", "MS6" and "NR8082") (James et al, 2000).

Use clean plant material for planting.

Plant at the onset of the rains to encourage vigorous growth and thereby
increase tolerance to mite attack. Cassava plants aged 2-9 months are the most vulnerable
to infestation.


Practise intercropping. Cassava intercropped with pigeon pea has been reported to suffer
less damage from cassava green mite than that grown on a pure stand in Nigeria. Higher
tuber yields were obtained when cassava was intercropped with pigeon pea in triple and
double rows than when it was alternated in a single row or in a pure stand (Ezulike and
Egwuatu, 1993).

Red spider mites (Oligonychus gossypii and Tetranychus spp.)
Several species of red spider mites also occur on cassava, mostly on the older leaves. Adults are
about 0.6 mm long. Initial symptoms are yellowish pinpricks along the main vein of mature
leaves. Spider mites produce protective webbing that can be readily seen on the plant. Attacked
leaves turn reddish, brown or rusty in colour. Under severe mite attack, leaves die and drop
beginning with older leaves. Most damage occurs at the beginning of the dry season.
What to do:

Conserve natural enemies. Local natural enemies usually control these spider mites and
no further control measures are needed.

Avoid planting next to infested fields.

Avoid use of broad-spectrum pesticides, in particular pyrethroids; this may lead to spider
mite outbreaks.

Cassava scales (Aonidomytilus albus)
It is a mussel-shaped scale with an elongated silvery-white cover and about 2-2.5 mm long. This
scale may cover the stem with conspicuous white secretions, and eventually the leaves. This
scale sucks from the stem and dehydrates it. The leaves of attacked plants turn pale, wilt and
drop off. Severely attacked plants are stunted and yield poorly. Scale attack can kill cassava
plants, in particular plants weakened by previous insect attack and drought. Stem cuttings
derived from infested stem portions normally do not sprout.
What to do:

Apply of organic matter to improve soil fertility.

Selection of clean (scale free) planting material.

Destroy infested stems.

Avoid use of pesticides in the cassava field or in neighbouring crops, which may kill
natural enemies.

Grasshoppers (Zonocerus variegatus)
Grasshoppers such as the variegated grasshopper (West to East Africa south of the Sahara), and
the elegant grasshopper (Z. elegans) (Southern Africa and East Africa) are brightly coloured
grasshoppers.
Adults are dark green with yellow, black and orange marking on their bodies. Nymphs are black
with yellow markings on the body, legs and antenna and wing pads. Female grasshoppers lay
many eggs just below the surface of the soil in the shade under evergreen plants, usually outside
cassava fields. Eggs are laid in masses of froth, which harden to form sponge-like packets,
known as egg pods, which look like tiny groundnut pods. Eggs start to hatch at the beginning of
the main dry season.
Grasshoppers attack a wide range of crops mainly in the seedling stage. They feed on cassava
plants, chewing leaves and stems and may cause defoliation and debark stems. This is
particularly severe in fields next to the bush when the dry season is prolonged.
What to do:

Hand pick grasshoppers. This is feasible in small plots.

Locate and dig egg-laying sites to expose and destroy the eggs before they start to hatch
early in the dry season. However, egg pod destruction has to be done over a wide area in
the wet season in order to be effective. This will require participation of farmers on many
neighbouring farms. If only one neighbour destroys the eggs in his/her farm, the
grasshoppers will later invade the farm from the neighbouring farms and bushes.


When available, use biopesticides. IITA researchers and partners have developed an
environmental friendly biopesticide "Green Muscle(r)". It is based on a naturally
occurring fungus strain indigenous to Africa (Metarhizium anisopliae) which is deadly to
locusts and grasshoppers but reportedly does not damage other insects, plants, animals, or
people. Typically 70 to 100% mortality rates were obtained after 8 to 28 days of
application ( www.iita.org). The bioinsecticide "Green Muscle(r)" is effective in
grasshopper management in outbreak situations. However, it is costly and currently, it is
only available in South Africa and West Africa.

Use neem extracts. Neem protects cassava from grasshopper damage. It acts as
antifeedant (grasshoppers stop feeding when exposed to neem products) and affects
development of the grasshoppers (Nicol et al, 1995; Olaoifa and Adenuga, 1988).
In Nigeria, the following neem products have given good control of Z. variegatus on
cassava: 1.) Emulsifiable concentrate of neem oil at 0.5% to 2% applied at 8-day intervals
or at 3-4% at 10-day intervals, 2.) Aqueous neem kernel water extracts (NSKE) at 7-10%
applied every 12 days and aqueous neem leaf water extracts (NLWE) 50% applied every
6 days. Aqueous extracts from neem leaves were less effective than neem seed extracts
(Olaoifa and Adenuga, 1988). For more information on Neem click here.

Whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci, Aleurodicus dispersus)
Several species of whiteflies are found on cassava in Africa. Feeding causes direct damage,
which may cause considerable reduction in root yield if prolonged feeding occurs. Some
whiteflies cause major damage to cassava as vectors of cassava viruses. The spiralling whitefly
(Aleurodicus dispersus) was reported as a new pest of cassava in West Africa in the early 90s.

The adults and nymphs of this whitefly occur in large numbers on the lower surfaces of leaves
covered with large amount of white waxy material. Females lay eggs on the lower leaf surface in
spiral patterns (like fingerprints) of white material secreted by the female. This whitefly sucks
sap from cassava leaves. It excretes large amounts of honeydew, which supports the growth of
black sooty mould on the plant, causing premature fall of older leaves.
The tobacco whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) transmits the African cassava mosaic virus, one of the
most important factors limiting production in Africa. The adults and nymphs of the tobacco
whitefly occur on the lower surface of young leaves. They are not covered with white material.
The nymphs appear as pale yellow oval specks to the naked eye.
What to do:

Conserve natural enemies. Parasitic wasps in particular are very important for natural
control of whiteflies. For instance Encarsia formosa, natural enemy of the tobacco
whitefly, and Encarsia haitiensis a natural enemy of the spiralling whitefly
(Neuenschwander, 1998; James, et al, 2000).

Termites
Different species of termites damage cassava stems and roots. Termites damage cassava planted
late or in the dry season, in particular when the crop is still young at the peak of the dry season.
They chew and eat stem cuttings which grow poorly, die and rot. The may destroy whole
plantations. In older cassava plants termites chew and enter the stems. This weakens the stems
and causes them to break easily.

What to do:

Plant early with the rains.

Avoid planting on very dry land or on termite mounds.

Storage pests
A number of beetles feed on dry cassava causing post harvest losses. In Benin Republic the most
common are Dinoderus sp., Carpophilus sp., the coffee bean weevil (Araecerus fasciculatus),
the lesser grain borer (Rhizopertha dominica), and more recently, the larger grain borer
(Prostephanus truncatus).
Infestation by these insects is heavier in the rainy season than in the dry season, is more
prevalent in the humid zone than in the savannah, and is found more in large chips than in
smaller ones. Maximum infestation was found after 6 to 8 months in storage, at which time chips
would fall into dust when squeezed (Bokanga, IITA, FAO).
What to do:

Use botanicals or plant parts to protect stored cassava. There are reports in Kenya, that
the larger grain borer can be effectively repelled by storing cassava or grains with a fairly
large amount of dried lantana or eucalyptus leaves (Personal communication, field officer
of Meru herbs). Neem is also reported to be effective.

3. Information on Diseases
African Cassava Mosaic Disease (ACMD)
African cassava mosaic disease is one of the most serious and widespread diseases throughout
cassava growing areas in Africa, causing yield reductions of up to 90%. It is spread through
infected cuttings and by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci).
Symptoms occur as characteristic leaf mosaic patterns that affect discrete areas and are
determined at an early stage of leaf development. Symptoms vary from leaf to leaf, shoot to
shoot and plant to plant, even of the same variety and virus strain in the same locality. Some
leaves situated between affected ones may seem normal and give the appearance of recovery.
What to do:

Use disease-free cuttings. If it is not possible to find cassava plants that are completely
free from the disease, select cuttings from stem branches instead of from the main stem.
Stem cuttings from the branches are more likely to sprout into disease-free plants than
stem cuttings from the main stems (James et al, 2000).

Resistance to ACMD has been successfully incorporated into high yielding cultivars of
acceptable quality through breeding programmes at IITA. Use resistant/tolerant varieties
(e.g. "SS 4", "TMS 60142", "TMS 30337" and "TMS 30572").

Cassava bacterial blight (Xanthomonas campestris pv. manihotis)
It is a major constraint to cassava cultivation in Africa. Infected leaves show localised, angular,
water-soaked areas. Under severe disease attack heavy defoliation occurs, leaving bare stems,
referred to as "candle sticks". Since the disease is systemic, infected stems and roots show
brownish discolouration. During periods of high humidity, bacterial exudation (appears as gum)
can readily be observed on the lower leaf surfaces of infected leaves and on the petioles and
stems. The disease is favoured by wet conditions.
This disease is primarily spread by infected cuttings. It can also be mechanically transmitted by
raindrops, use of contaminated farm tools (e.g. knives), chewing insects (e.g. grasshoppers) and
movement of man and animals through plantations, especially during or after rain. Yield loss due
to the disease may range from 20 to 100% depending on variety, bacterial strain and
environmental conditions.
What to do:

Use clean planting material. This can reduce disease incidence in areas where cassava
bacterial blight is already widespread.

In cases of sporadic occurrence of the disease, collect cuttings only from healthy plants
and from the most lignified portion of the stem, up to 1 m from the base. Check visually
the cuttings for vascular browning. Disinfect tools regularly.

Intercrop cassava with maize or melon. This been reported to reduce cassava bacterial
blight significantly.


Practise crop rotation and fallowing. These practices proved very successful when the
new crop was planted with uninfected cuttings. Rotation or fallowing should last at least
1 rainy season.

Remove and burn all infected plant debris and weeds. Alternatively plough them into the
soil.

Brown leaf spot (Cercosporidium henningsii)
Symptoms are restricted to older leaves. Brownish round spots with definite borders appear on
the upper leaf surface. On the lower leaf surface, they are brownish-grey in colour. Infected
leaves later become yellow and eventually drop. In wet areas the disease may cause a yield
reduction of up to 20%.
What to do:

Though the disease is widespread in most cassava growing countries, it is not an
economically important disease problem and it does not warrant any intervention.

Cassava brown streak virus disease (Potyvirus - Potyviridae)
It is particularly serious in coastal areas of Kenya, Zanzibar, Mozambique and Tanzania and
lakeshore region of Malawi and in Uganda and is a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa.
The virus is vectored by whiteflies (Bemisia spp.) and also transmitted through infected cuttings.
Symptoms include yellowing (leaf chlorosis) and brown streaks in the stem bark (cortex).
Infected tubers have brown streaks (root necrosis) (Field Crops Technical Handbook, MoA,
Kenya). It's a stealth virus, which destroys everything in the field. The leaves may appear healthy
even when the roots have rotted away.
What to do:

Use diseased-free cuttings.

Use tolerant/resistant varieties (e.g. "5543/156", "TMS 30572")

Remove diseased plants from the field.

Anthracnose (Glomerella manihotis)
Initial symptoms of the disease are oval lesions ("sores") on young stems. On older stems, raised
fibrous lesions develop that eventually become sunken.
What to do:

It is not an economically important disease in most cassava growing countries and it does
not warrant any intervention.

Post harvest diseases
Some fungi growth on cassava chips, usually when the moisture content of cassava chips
exceeds 14%, making them unfit for feed and food. A survey of cassava chips processing areas

of West Africa has indicated that the most common fungi were Rhizopus sp. and Aspergillus sp.
(IITA, 1996).
What to do:

Early harvesting prevents or reduces the incidence of rots on farms.

Rotate cassava with cereals to help reduce the levels of inoculum (spores etc.) on fields.
