Executive summary
1.
Background
This study, commissioned by the Rockefeller Foundation, set out to identify and
understand the extent to which, and ways in which, information from climate change
models is being integrated into agricultural development practice and decision making in
Africa.

2.
Overview of climate data for Africa
The development of climate projections for Africa is evolving rapidly. General Circulation
Models (GCMs) now project climate parameters at a resolution of 250 km2, while
downscaled models provide projections at 50km2. The science of climate modeling is
complex and efforts to communicate this science to agricultural users remain rudimentary
and fraught with what are perceived to be contradictory and unreliable messages.   Within
the climate science community there is an emerging effort to make findings more suitable
for decision making, but as yet there is very little consensus as to how data may be relied
on for decision making.

3.
Nature of climate data used in Africa
While awareness of and references to climate change are both increasing, this is mainly
based on highly aggregated data from the IPCC Data Distribution Centre and GCMs. The
climate data that are used within African agriculture are generated by a few key
international organizations.  These include the UK Met Office’s Hadley Centre and their
dynamical downscaling PRECIS model, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, USA) and CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France)
General Circulation Model (GCM) data are used to provide seasonal climate forecasts for
Africa. The use of these data is based on their accessibility and familiarity to the users,
rather than their suitability to the specific problem or research question being addressed.
As such there is very little discernment of the relative merits of different climate models for
specific regions or purposes, even though models differ markedly in their utility for specific
regions and parameters.

4. Approaches to downscaling in Africa
A number of African-based research projects use a single GCM model with local climate
data to run dynamical and empirically downscaled models. Downscaling based on a single
GCM amplifies the limitations of that GCM. Relative to downscales that rely on multiple
models, downscales based on a single GCM permit limited local inference.

5.
Local climate modeling institutions
Modeling of African climate is limited from within Africa. The only African institution that
is generating empirical downscaled climate data based on multiple models is CSAG at the
University of Cape Town, but applications and further analysis based on this data remain
limited. ACMAD, in West Africa, and ICPAC, in East Africa, have focused on providing
seasonal climate information but are starting to explore climate change scenarios primarily
by using PRECIS, a Regional Climate model (RCM).  National Meteorological Services

have previously not been mandated to work on climate change but in many countries they
are starting to explore these issues.

6.
Responding to climate variability versus climate change
Whilst African agriculture has always had to, and continues to, adapt to changing
environmental circumstances (including climate), there is a danger that this adaptation with
its focus on climate variability, will not take cognizance of the trends imposed by
anthropogenic climate change.

7.
Application of climate change data
Amongst farmers, applications of the existing downscaled data in decision making is
limited to a few progressive and long-term farming schemes and agribusinesses. This is
unsurprising as there is currently very little evidence that short-rotation crop farmers stand
to benefit from using the available climate data in their decision making due to the
temporal and spatial scale at which this data are reported.

What is conspicuous is that very few agricultural policy makers, crop breeders and donor
agencies - whom one might expect to adopt a longer-term and more strategic focus - apply
the available climate data in their program formulation.

8.
Evidence of adaptation to climate change
There are currently very few “proofs of concept” – that is examples of agricultural decision
makers that have successfully drawn on climate change projection data to take decisions
that have improved agricultural productivity or human well-being. This is a function of the
temporal and spatial at which climate data are provided as well as the way in which they are
reported, perceived in terms of the reliability of the data, questions of their relevance to
agriculture, and difficulty in accessing and understanding the data.

To address this “disconnect” between climate science and African agriculture, capacity
capable of linking existing climate data and agricultural decision making needs to be
created. This is as much an institutional challenge as it is a technical and human resource
challenge.

9.
Developing multi-disciplinary adaptation capacity
The nature of climate change adaptation demands that efforts to support African
agriculture in the face of climate change incorporate a multi-disciplinary set of stakeholders
including climate science experts, agricultural practitioners and technicians, local
communities/civil society, donors and policy makers. A key challenge involves extending
the capacity that currently exists in agro-meteorological disciplines to include agro-climatic
competency.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

Local “climate change adaptation platforms” have been proposed by a number of
development agencies, as a means of promoting collaboration between scientists and
practitioners, and enhancing local adaptation capacity including the ability to draw on
climate data. It is essential that these institutions design their activities around local needs
and not the funding or reporting requirements of the international climate change
community.

10.
Support processes not projects
Climate change adaptation is, at its best, a social learning process that equips local decision
makers to respond to a wide range of difficult to predict contingencies brought on by
perturbed climates. Although once-off projects are capable of delivering technical capacity
and social learning, experience has shown that creating the capacity to apply climate
information is a resource intensive process that takes time. Therefore it is important that
funding for climate change adaptation goes beyond pilot projects and once-off
interventions, and instead allows local institutions to explore the relevant issues and
develop the broad set of institutional capacity and technical skills that will equip them for
the challenge. Developing the necessary independence and stability will require a lot of
inputs from different stakeholders. For donors this presents the challenge of ensuring that
funding for processes, which is more difficult to monitor than funding for projects, still
delivers robust benefits and value for money.

Chapter 1: Introduction
This study, commissioned by the Rockefeller Foundation, set out to identify and
understand the extent to which, and ways in which, information from climate change
models is being integrated into agricultural development practice and decision making in
Africa1.

To this end it focused on three activities:

1. Locating the landscape: A description of the current knowledge linking climate
change models with African agricultural development practice, and an identification
of the institutions and stakeholders involved in the associated activities.
2. Barriers to using climate change data: The challenges confronted by agricultural
development programs and farming communities in Africa that are seeking to
access and use information are presented.
3. Climate data recommendations: The identification of options and opportunities for
improving the uptake of climate information for developing adaptation responses

Adaptation to climate variability is not new, but climate change is expected to present
heightened risk, new combinations of risks and potentially grave consequences. This is
particularly true in Africa where direct dependence on the natural environment for
livelihood support combines with a lack of infrastructure and high levels of poverty to
create vulnerability in the face of all types of environmental change. Accordingly there is a
growing focus on the need for “anticipatory adaptation” (UNDP, 2007), that is the
proactive rather than the reactive management of climate change risk. Anticipatory
adaptation relies on the best available information concerning the nature of future climate
risks.

The Rockefeller Foundation, in commissioning this work, acknowledged a need that had
been articulated by others (Nyong, 2005; Patt, 2007; Wilby, 2007) namely to gain a better
understanding of which institutions were undertaking what work in the rapidly evolving
field of climate change adaptation, as well as potential for a better coordination of both
donor funded activities and climate science applications. In addition, insight into the
perceived disconnect between the rapidly evolving work of climate scientists and the long-
standing agricultural development community, was further perceived as being important
and was targeted by the study.

The content of this report is structured as follows:

• Chapter 2 outlines the approach that was taken to assessing who the key players
were in the field of adaptation to climate change within the agricultural
development sector in Africa and establishing the barriers and opportunities to
using climate change information within this field.

• Chapter 3 presents background information on issues around the production and
use of climate science, impacts of climate change on agricultural development and
the potential for adaptation.

• The material from the interviews is presented in Chapter 4, summarizing the focus
and role of different institutions including representatives from the donor, climate
science, agricultural development and adaptation communities.

• Chapter 5 draws on the interview material to present key findings and is followed
by Chapter 6 that proposes some recommendations in order to address the barriers
and opportunities for using climate science for adaptation within the agricultural
development sector in Africa.

• The final chapter presents recommendations for improving the value of existing
and future climate science for use in agricultural adaptation.

Chapter 2: Research approach

The study commenced with a review of literature and a web search aimed at identifying the
key issues and players in the field. This led to the compilation of a database that identified
and described a broad set of institutions working on climate change modeling and
agricultural development (including land and water management) in Africa. This included
individuals and institutions focused on agriculture, a limited number of institutions
supporting climate adaptation, development oriented donors and agencies, researchers and
climate scientists.

The agricultural focus of this study was limited to crop and livestock production. This is in
spite of notable impacts on forestry and fisheries which were excluded from this report.

Institutions in the database are clustered according to:
• Whether or not they use climate change scenarios
• Whether or not they use data on current climate variability
• The institution's work focus (e.g. crop development, water management, climate
change impacts, seasonal forecasting),
• Whether or not the institution has expressly developed or supported climate
adaptation strategies.

While the database is not exhaustive of the key players or their activities in this rapidly
expanding arena it does provide a useful oversight. By clustering stakeholders according to
their activities the database enables the identification of potential duplications and synergies
– something that has emerged as a priority in previous studies (Nyong, 2005; Wilby, 2007).
Although there was an attempt to report the financial resources committed towards climate
change adaptation by respective institutions, very few institutions separate climate
adaptation funding from general budgets, and reporting on budget allocations is
incomplete.

The database also assisted the research team in identifying candidates for the next phase of
the study which involved in-depth interviews. Drawing on the database and the
researchers’ experience in the field in an attempt to ensure a representative spread across
the disciplines of climate science, climate impacts, vulnerability and adaptation, agricultural
development and climate variability, forty one interviews were conducted. The interviews
provided the researchers with detailed insight into the activities of specific institutions and
particularly the ways in which they were (and in some instances were not) using climate
information.

Interviews, some of which were conducted in person2 and some on the telephone, followed
the format of semi-structured questionnaires aimed at establishing the following:

2  The Conference of Parties in Bali (December 2007) provided a fortuitous convening of experts and enabled
the research team to conduct a number of in-person interviews at low cost.

• An overview of the institution's climate change strategies, strengths and adaptation
pathways currently in place as well as those required.
• Identifying how different institutions accessed and used climate data.
• Gaps in the network as well as gaps in allied networks (water, health, disaster relief).
• Barriers for potential climate adaptation strategies that are created by climate
change data.
• Opportunities for improved climate change adaptation in Africa.
• Identification of the priorities of donors active in this field.
• Threats to current climate adaptation and the development of adaptation strategies,
including competing and counter-productive initiatives and prevailing mal-
adaptation.

The researchers convened in Cape Town in early February 2008 to reflect on and collate
the findings of the interviews. During this time, institutions were further classified into a
matrix according to their mandate (donor, research, practitioner) and their own description
of their primary focus (climate science, climate adaptation and agricultural development).3

The research team further used the time in Cape Town to map the flow of climate change
information from its various sources to different decision makers at the local level, and to
agree on the salient findings with regards to the use and influence of this information. The
interviews themselves, although detailed, provide a rich information resource for future
work and available as an appendix to this report.

3  Needless to say a number of the institutions straddled the focus activities. Such institutions were places in
the category most appropriate to their primary focus.

Chapter 3: Climate change and African agriculture – an
overview

Climate change is a complex biophysical process. It is not possible to predict precise future
climate conditions, but the scientific consensus is that global land and sea temperatures are
warming under the influence of greenhouse gases, and will continue to warm regardless of
human intervention for at least the next two decades (IPCC, 2007). The increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are mainly due to the 80 per cent
increase in annual CO2 emissions since 1970. Most of this historical increase emanated
from the industrial activities of developed countries in Europe, North America and Japan,
although the burgeoning economies of Brazil, China, India and South Africa have
contributed significantly in the past decade. Developing countries, especially those on the
African continent have contributed little to the observed global warming. Per unit of GDP
produced African economies are the most CO2 intensive in the world at 1.65 kg of CO2
equivalent per US $ dollar of GDP (indexed by 2000 dollars), but the relatively low levels
of economic activity on the continent result in low aggregate emissions. The same lack of
economic activity and poverty, render African countries, and especially the poorest
communities in these countries, disproportionately vulnerable to climate change impacts.
In regions of East and Southern Africa, this vulnerability is further heightened by the large
number of households that depend on the already marginalized natural resource base for
their livelihoods. Agricultural production and the biophysical, political and social systems
that determine food security in Africa are expected to be placed under considerable
additional stress by climate change (FAO, 2007).

The capacity to investigate these impacts can be enhanced by drawing on the best available
scientific information with regards to future climates.  This chapter provides an overview
of the evolution of climate science, its application to African agriculture and the key
dimensions of climate information for adaptation efforts in African agriculture.

3.1
Climate change science
Current research in climate science is focused on a few core lines of inquiry and several
excellent reviews are available on the subject (Wilby, 2007).  These research lines include 1)
measurement, estimation and monitoring of greenhouse gas concentrations in the
atmosphere; 2) sensitivity and radiative forcings: scenario development and testing via
models of modeling of the earth - ocean - atmosphere system to simulate responses to
external stimuli such as those resulting from increasing concentration of greenhouse gases
or from projected emissions based on plausible socio-economic futures. This line includes
the impacts resulting from the dynamic interplay and feedbacks between greenhouse gas
emissions and other climate parameters such as sea surface temperatures; 3) Downscaling
of outputs of the General Circulation Models (GCMs) that are used to project global
climate change, and 4) the description and translation of future climate data for

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

12
practitioners and decision makers at all scales.4 Climate change science can then be used for
modeling the impacts of climate change on agriculture (using crop models for example).

GCMs have been developed to project future climates based on different greenhouse gas
scenarios and complex earth atmosphere interactions. As such GCMs provide the means of
making climate change projections. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) has defined a set of criteria that have been applied to identify GCM experiments
whose results could be deposited at the IPCC Data Distribution Centre (DDC).  Among
these are physical plausibility and consistency with global projections (Smith and Hulme,
1998). These criteria led to an initial selection of experiments from five modeling centers
with the possibility of others to be added to the DDC as they qualify for inclusion.

The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report presented 23 general circulation models (GCMs) that
by design span the globe. While some of these models are relevant to Africa and are
reported at pixel resolutions of around 250 km2, the underlying data used to generate this
information are often so highly aggregated so as to undermine their utility at projecting
regional climate.  Table 1 provides information on where the models agree and if so, the
direction of change. However it also indicates that in some areas there is less predictability.
Whilst GCMs can more accurately project changes in average global temperature, these
projections are often of little use to decision makers working on regional or local scales.
Limited recognition of this fact is one of the findings to emerge from the interviews
conducted in this scoping study.

Table 1: Models have strengths in different aspects of climate projections and do not necessarily
concur on all aspects. Similarly the climate of some regions are innately more predictable than other
regions and models tend to agree in their forecasts of these regions. This is illustrated in this
summary table of climate model consistency in regional precipitation projections for 2090-2099
under SRES A1B emissions. Regions in which the middle half of all model projections show
disagreement on the sign of change are classified as inconsistent. Regions showing model
consensus are indicated as small (5-20%) or large (>20%) increases or decreases (Source: IPCC,
2007). The table highlights the importance of selecting the right model for the regional and climate
focus as well as the potential merits of using multiple model forecasts.

4  Future climate data can be broadly separated into seasonal climate forecasts, decadal forecasting and climate
change projections or scenarios.  Seasonal climate forecasting focuses on projections of rainfall and
temperature in the coming year and are widely available (www.iri.columbia.edu ), decadal forecasts of climate
projections for the coming 10 years are not well developed (Wilby, 2007) and climate change scenarios focus
on the 2040 – 2100 time scale (with a number of Global Circulation Models being available on the IPCC
DDC site www.ipcc-data.org).

Nevertheless, growing recognition of the need for climate information at finer scales is
itself a driver of the volume of work aimed at downscaling climate model information for
local and regional decision makers. Two approaches dominate the downscaling efforts,
each based on a specific set of assumptions and methodologies: empirical and dynamical
downscaling (also known as regional climate models: RCMs). Figure 1 shows how these
different types of climate modeling approaches fit together. These downscaled climate
change models take data from GCMs and interpret them in relation to local climate
dynamics (Tadross et al., 2005). The difference in pixel resolution between GCMs and
RCMs can be seen in Figure 2.

• Empirical downscaling makes use of the quantitative relationships between the state
of the larger scale climatic environment and local variations sourced from historical
data. By coupling specific local baseline climate data with GCM output, it provides a
valuable solution to overcoming the mismatch in scale between climate model
projections and the unit under investigation. Empirical downscaling can be applied to a
grid or to a particular meteorological station. The later sub-set of empirical downscaling
is more common and referred to as statistical empirical downscaling.
The Climate Systems Analysis Group (CSAG) (www.csag.uct.ac.za), based at the
University of Cape Town, South Africa, operates the preeminent empirical downscaled
model for Africa and provides meteorological station level responses to global climate
forcings for a growing number of stations across the African continent. The data
requirements (10 years of quality controlled daily climate measurements) and technical
skills intensity required for empirical downscaling has resulted in no other institutions in
Africa producing such data.  Existing adaptation studies and programs have had limited
awareness of the availability of such data. This is gradually changing, with a growing
number of adaptation and climate impact studies benefiting from the downscaled
information provided by this and other downscaling approaches (Wilby and Wigley,
1997; Prudhomme et al., 2003; Wilby and Harris, 2006). Figure 3 below shows the
downscaled climate data produced by CSAG, as presented in the IPCC (Christensen et
al., 2007).  One of the key points is that the six different downscaled projections are
showing agreement in the direction of change for rainfall in many parts of Africa.
Another empirical downscaling approach, Statistical Downscaling Methodology (SDSM)
has gained some applicability to Africa (Wilby et al, 2002). SDSM applies a single GCM
model and requires the user to acquire historical local climate data in order to run the
downscaling. Much of the use of SDSM in Africa has been restricted to students who
applied this approach in their masters and doctoral dissertations. For example, a
research project used SDSM to downscale HadCM3 to estimate the impact of climate
change on Ethiopia’s Lake Ziway’s hydrology to 2099 (Zeray et al., 2006).  Changes in
climate variables were applied to a hydrological model so as to simulate future flows.

Figure 3: Anomaly of mean monthly precipitation (mm) using daily data empirically downscaled
from six GCMs (ECHAM4.5, Hadley Centre Atmospheric Model (HadAM3), CSIRO Mk2, GFDL
2.1, MRI, MIROC) to 858 station locations. The GCMs were forced by the SRES A2 scenario.
Anomalies are for the future period (2070 to 2099 for the first three models, and 2080 to 2099 for
the latter three models) minus a control 30-year period (from Hewitson and Crane, 2006).

• Dynamical downscaling and regional climate models makes use of the boundary
conditions (e.g. Atmospheric parameters from a GCM such as surface pressure, wind,
temperature and vapour) and principles of physics within an atmospheric circulation
system to generate small scale (high resolution) datasets. Due to its reliance on high-
resolution physical datasets, the approach is useful in the representation of extreme
events. However, dynamical downscaling is a computationally and technically expensive
method, a characteristic that has limited the number of institutions employing the
approach. Key among the dynamical downscaled models in use in Africa are the MM5
WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model), Darlam (CSIRO, Australia) and
PRECIS (Providing REgional Climates for Impacts Studies, UK Met Office) models.
PRECIS, a product of the UK Met Office, relies exclusively on the Hadley Centre’s
GCMs at present, and is the most widely used downscaled model in Africa.
An important component of climate change science involves the description,
understanding, and representation of the inherent uncertainties in the modeling efforts.
Uncertainty in climate change science is a function of the difficulties of modeling a
complex and not entirely understood pair of inter-related systems (i.e. oceans,
atmospheres), lack of complete knowledge on natural variability, an imperfect
understanding of future greenhouse gas concentrations, and the likely impacts that
surprises will bring to the climate system (Stainforth et al, 2007). Whilst it is known that
specific models are more “skilled” at predicting specific parameters in certain regions,
without a comprehensive exploration of multiple model outputs, choosing a single model

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

16
for a specific region is not advisable (IPCC 2007). An analysis of an “ensemble” of models,
rather than a single model, is the best way of addressing the uncertainty inherent in making
a decision which is influenced by the future evolution of the climate system.  These
“envelopes” – as the multiple model outputs are called - of climate change help define the
range of potential climate change based on a number of multi-model projections. Whilst
envelopes do not provide the type of discrete answers that some decision makers seek, they
do allow analysis based on different models. This provides decision makers with valuable
perspective on what might be expected. It also allows decision makers to collate the
projections of different models to find points of maxim (and very little) concordance,
which in turn can be used to attach the appropriate level of confidence to projections and
associated decisions. Wrongly assumed confidence in climate projections can be as
dangerous (sometimes more dangerous) than having no projection at all. Figure 4 provides
an example of the envelope approach by taking three different downscaled precipitation
anomaly scenarios for a location in Mali. The outer range of the combined model
projections provides the “envelope” within which precipitation is expected to change.

different model projections while the gray area denotes the envelope.  Sample output from the
Climate Change Explorer indicating model agreement in the changing distribution of rainfall from
March through September, which comprise the growing season for this region in Mali.

Central to the approach adopted by (CSAG) is the Climate Change Explorer, a tool
designed to simplify the tasks associated with the extraction, query and analysis of climate
information. The intention is to enable users to address issues of uncertainty when devising
policies and strategies, and when implementing actions.  This Climate Change Explorer
Tool facilitates crucial links between understanding vulnerability, monitoring and projecting
climate hazards and planning adaptation processes.  Figure 4 was produced using the
Climate Change Explorer.

3.2
Climate impacts on agricultural development
The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report summary for Africa describes a trend of warming
at a rate faster than the global average, and increasing aridity (see Text Box 1). Climate
change exerts multiple stresses on the biophysical as well as the social and institutional
environments that underpin agricultural production. Some of the induced changes are
expected to be abrupt, while others involve gradual shifts in temperature, vegetation cover
and species distributions. Climate change is expected to, and in parts of Africa has already
begun to, alter the dynamics of drought, rainfall and heatwaves, and trigger secondary
stresses such as the spread of pests, increased competition for resources, the collapse of
financial institutions, and attendant biodiversity losses.

Predicting the impact of climate change on complex biophysical and socio-economic
systems that constitute agricultural sectors is difficult.  In many parts of Africa it seems that
warmer climates and changes in precipitation will destabilise agricultural production. This is
expected to undermine the systems that provide food security (Gregory et al., 2005).
Whilst farmers in some regions may benefit from longer growing seasons and higher yields,
the general consequences for Africa, as reported in Text Box 1, are expected to be adverse,
and particularly adverse for the poor and the marginalized who do not have the means to
withstand shocks and changes.

Evidence from the IPCC suggests that areas of the Sahara are likely to emerge as the most
vulnerable to climate change by 2100 with likely agricultural losses of between 2 and 7% of
GDP. Western and Central Africa are expected to have losses ranging from 2 to 4% and
Northern and Southern Africa are expected to have losses of 0.4 to 1.3% (Mendelsohn et
al., 2000).  Maize production is expected to decrease under possible increased ENSO
conditions which are expected in southern Africa (Stige et al., 2006).

A South African study undertaken by the University of Pretoria and focusing at the
provincial level, found a significant correlation between higher historical temperatures and
reduced dryland staple production, and forecast a fall in netcrop revenues by as much as
90% by 2100. The study found small-scale farmers to be worst affected by the decrease.

Text Box 1: Key attributes of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report for Africa
Source: Christensen et al. 2007, p.850

• Warming is very likely to be larger than the global annual mean warming throughout the continent
and in all seasons, with drier subtropical regions warming more than the moister tropics.
• Annual rainfall is likely to decrease in much of Mediterranean Africa and the northern Sahara, with a
greater likelihood of decreasing rainfall as the Mediterranean coast is approached.
• Rainfall in southern Africa is likely to decrease in much of the winter rainfall region and western
margins.
• There is likely to be an increase in annual mean rainfall in East Africa.
• It is unclear how rainfall in the Sahel, the Guinean Coast and the southern Sahara will evolve.

A Nigerian study applied the EPIC crop model to give projections of crop yield in during
the 21st century. The study modeled worst case climate change scenarios for maize,
sorghum, rice, millet and cassava (Adejuwon, 2006). The indications from the projections
are that, in general, there will be increases in crop yield across all low land ecological zones
as the climate changes during the early parts of the 21st century. However, towards the end
of the century, the rate of increase will tend to slow down. This could result in lower yields
in the last quarter than in the third quarter of the century. The decreases in yield could be
explained in terms of the very high temperatures which lie beyond the range of tolerance
for the current crop varieties and cultivars.

An Egyptian study compared crop production under current climate conditions with those
projected for 2050, and forecast a decrease in national production of many crops, ranging
from –11% for rice to –28% for soybeans (Eid et al., 2006). Other potential impacts linked
to agriculture include erosion that could be exacerbated by expected increased intensity of
rainfall and the crop growth period that is expected to be reduced in some areas (Agoumi,
2003). Changes are also expected in the onset of the rainy season and the variability of dry
spells (e.g., Reason et al., 2005).

Thornton et al., (2006) mapped climate vulnerability with a focus on the livestock sector.
The areas they identified as being particularly prone to climate change impacts included
arid-semiarid rangeland and the drier mixed agro-ecological zones across the continent,
particularly in Southern Africa and the Sahel, and coastal systems in East Africa.  An
important point they raise is that macro-level analyses can hide local variability around
often complex responses to climate change.  Figure 6 shows two scenarios where >20%
reduction in the length of the growing period is expected by 2050.

The International Livestock Research Institute in collaborate with Michigan State
University have conducted a number of local studies aimed at understanding local
variability and the complex interactions between local land use practices, local climate and
human well being. The impacts of climate change on livestock are likely to be felt from an
increased severity and frequency of drought. Deterioration of pastures during droughts,
and periods of over-grazing can result in poor health and death of livestock, which impacts
food and livelihood security of those who own livestock. In times of water scarcity, when
livestock are forced to use the same water resources as humans, diseases are transferred
between humans and animals and vice versa. Where livestock practices alter local
vegetation cover, this in turn affects local climate (Olson, pers. comm.).

In northwest Kenya, recurring droughts have led to increased competition for grazing
resources, livestock losses and conflict. Based on temperature and precipitation readings,
Michigan State University have found no discernable trend in the frequency or intensity of
droughts in the region, in spite of local farmers articulating a worsening situation. There is
a suggestion that higher average temperatures have stressed the regions vegetation to the
extent that it takes less extreme hot and dry spells to inflict drought like conditions.

3.3
Climate adaptation and agricultural development
Climate change adaptation aims to mitigate and develop appropriate coping measures to
address the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture. Most agricultural systems
have a measure of in-built adaptation capacity (“autonomous adaptation”) but the current
rapid rate of climate change will impose new and potentially overwhelming pressures on
existing adaptation capacity.  This is particularly true given that the secondary changes
induced by climate change are expected to undermine the ability of people and ecosystems
to cope with, and recover from, extreme climate events and other natural hazards. It is for

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

20
this reason that the IPCC encourages “planned adaptation”, that is deliberate steps aimed
at creating the capacity to cope with climate change impacts (IPCC, 2007).

Effective adaptation strategies and actions should aim to secure well-being in the face of
climate variability, climate change and a wide variety of difficult to predict biophysical and
social contingencies. In pursuing this aim, climate adaptation should focus on support for
the decision-making and capacity building processes that shape social learning, technology
transfer, innovation and development pathways. Adaptation is most relevant when it
influences decisions that exist irrespective of climate change, but which have longer-term
consequences (Stainforth et al., 2007).

A key component of climate adaptation involves building resilience, where resilience is the
capacity of a system to tolerate disturbance without collapsing into a qualitatively different
state that is controlled by a different set of processes: a resilient system can withstand
shocks and rebuild itself when necessary.

Over sixty per cent of Africans remain directly dependent on agriculture and natural
resources for their well-being (FAO, 2003). Agriculture is highly dependent on climate
variability (Salinger et al., 2005) which is why the threat of climate change is particularly
urgent in Africa (Boko et al, 2007).

Despite the reliance on large proportions of the population on agriculture, agricultural
development has historically not been a priority of governments, with 1%or less of the
average national budgets going to agriculture (FAO, 2003).  However many donors and
NGOs have supported agriculture across the continent because of this reliance on
agriculture and the potential to improve yields.  Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa
(AGRA) is an example of such an organization that is supporting agriculture development
across the chain from funding projects on seeds and soils to markets and policies
(www.agra-alliance.org).

In spite of the documented exposure of agricultural activities to projected changes in
climate, not all agricultural institutions have made use of climate science data. The current
tendency is for institutions to reference climate change as a backdrop to their work as
opposed integrating probabilistic future climate data into their current planning and
research approaches. Accordingly it is difficult to distinguish the documented cases of
climate change adaptation in Africa from general development and agricultural practice.
The impacts of the East African droughts, for example, have been countered in some
instances by digging and maintaining sand dams in river bottoms. The dams allow for
continued cattle watering during dry periods, and have reduced cattle deaths and conflict. It
is not possible, however, to establish climate change as the trigger for the construction of
sand dams (or other adaptation measures), and the people constructing sand dams do not
draw on climate change data.

This apparent disconnect between adaptation efforts and climate data is in spite of efforts
on behalf of climate scientists (including ACMAD, Tyndall Centre, AGRHYMET, Walker
Institute and CSAG at the University of Cape Town) to make their work more relevant to

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

21
agriculture, and the equally concerted attempts by the impact community to clarify their
climate information needs. Some interviewees attributed this situation to a lack of
understanding among agriculturalists of how climate data can or should be applied. As Neil
Leary from START suggested, most farming groups are naïve as to how difficult it is to
understand, interpret and use climate information. It is equally true, however, that much of
the climate modeling work remains focused on gaining greater understanding of
atmospheric dynamics, and does not appreciate the type of issues confronted by farmers or
the manner in which data needs to be packaged so as to make it accessible to agricultural
decision makers.

As such agricultural adaptation that has always taken, and continues to take place in Africa,
is responding more to perceived climate variability than climate change. This is true of the
examples unearthed in this study, as well as the season forecasting and drought early
warning systems that enjoy increasing use (especially among livestock farmers) on the
continent. Very little has been accomplished in relating crop yield and animal productivity
to climate change in Africa, even though the appropriate methodology is available in
contemporary literature. Whilst these systems have proven their worth for farmers, there is
a danger that farmers, agricultural policy makers, crop breeders and government officials
that structure their activities around short term climate variability, will be exposed by the
trend of climate change and its longer-term implications.

Three problems appear to impede the wider use climate data for farmers and agricultural
decision makers. First, climate change data are not available at the spatial resolution
required by farmers and as such farmers struggle to reconcile their observations of the
weather with climate projections and lose confidence in the projections. Second, the
timeframes (or temporal resolution) over which climate data are reported is often of little
relevance to farmers. Whilst one might expect policy makers to consider the implications
of a 2050 projection, farmers base their decision on more immediate issues. Third, there
are very few African scientists with the requisite training and experience to interpret and
apply climate change data in the agricultural context.

Chapter 4: Institutions and programs active in African climate
science and agricultural adaptation

The study required a mapping of the institutions and programs that are currently active in
the field of African climate science, agricultural development and climate change
adaptation.

This chapter draws on the database of institutions that was compiled at the inception of the
report, the researchers’ professional experience and the results of the forty-one interviews
conducted by the researchers to provide an oversight of the key players and their programs.

The list of institutions and programs cited in this section is neither definitive nor
exhaustive. It does however aim to identify and describe the key players and activities in the
rapidly expanding field of climate science and agricultural development in Africa.

Once the interviews had been conducted, institutions were clustered according to their
primary focus: climate science, climate adaptation and agricultural development, as well as
in terms of their mandate: donors and development agencies, researchers and practitioners
(see Table 2 below).

Note: White: national activities based within African countries, Green: regional activities, based in
Africa, Blue: internationally based

From this table it is evident that the study focused on the specific donors addressing
climate change adaptation. Interestingly these donors are all internationally based, as are the
majority of climate scientists. The national climate science activity that is taking place is
linked to organizations such as ACMAD and ICPAC. In the table we have classified much
of this activity under “practitioners” as it tends to be linked to public services. One of the
findings emerging from the study that is reflected in the table is the lack of adaptation
specific practitioners.  There are practitioners in the agricultural sector who are exploring
climate change impacts, and there are climate scientists focusing on adaptation. There is
noteworthy lack of practitioners with knowledge of both climate change and agricultural
adaptation.

4.1 Donors involved in climate science and agricultural adaptation
It is clear that adaptation is becoming more widely supported among donors.  Increased
support for adaptation is coming from traditional development donors who see the need to
protect the benefits of their program and projects against climate change, as well as some
donors that see climate change adaptation as a goal in itself.

Government agencies are scaling up their adaptation commitment and the number of
people assigned to work on adaptation is growing. For example, GTZ have 10 people
working on climate change with 2 dedicated to adaptation issues, USAID have 5 people
working on climate change issues, with 2 of those focused on adaptation and SIDA are just

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

24
starting to grow their adaptation focus. The World Bank has 15 people in its climate
change group, 9 of whom work on adaptation globally. FAO, similarly, have launched a
well attended Inter-departmental Working Group on Climate Change, with a specific
adaptation focus.

Department for International Development (DfID) integrate climate change adaptation
into their Central Policy Research Division, the work of their country offices and into their
pan-African program. DfID do not fund climate change models, but do have a number of
programs focusing on rural economies in Africa.

In terms of its funding allocations, DfID’s lead adaptation program is the Climate Change
Adaptation in Africa (CCAA) program. The £24 million program is funded jointly by
DFID’s research division and IDRC (Canada). “The CCAA program works to establish a
self-sustained skilled body of expertise in Africa to enhance the ability of African countries
to adapt.” CCAA makes use of a variety of climate and weather data use to inform its
adaptation support. In Benin, for example, farmers in the CCAA program received access
to a “weather pre-alert” system, but did not make use of medium term or long term climate
forecasts.  In the Western Cape of South, fruit farmers in the CCAA program did get the
benefit of GCM forecasts from the Hadley Centre to assist them in anticipating water
availability scenarios, but these models were at a continental scale.
In order to protect this portfolio of projects against climate change DfID has undertaken
an internal due diligence study aimed at identifying risks created by climate change for their
existing and proposed work. The study relied on PRECIS to gain an idea of future climate
related risks in Africa and, somewhat surprisingly given the number of agricultural and
water projects that DfID supports in Africa, concluded that risks to DfID work were
generally quite low on the grounds that their poverty alleviation efforts contributed to
climate coping capacity. DGIS and DANIDA have conducted similar “climate screening”
exercises on their activities; their conclusions were less optimistic.

International Development Research Centre (IDRC) has partnered with the
Department for International Development (DFID) to fund The Climate Change
Adaptation in Africa (CCAA) is a 5-year program which started in 2006.  The program is
currently funding 14 projects in Africa with a budget of £24 million. The main aim of
CCAA is to improve the capacity of African people and institutions to adapt to climate
change in ways that benefit the most vulnerable. In order to do so, the CCAA supports a
range of activities that build research capacity and provide evidence to strengthen
adaptation policies and plans.

There are various ways in which the program is trying to increase the engagement of
stakeholders and improve the communication of climate information. Firstly, an action
research approach is taken on adaptation which links communities, researchers,
development agents and policymakers in a shared process of testing new and existing
adaptation strategies. Furthermore, the CCAA supports a learning-by-doing approach as
well as a range of communication and dissemination activities to see knowledge on
adaptive practice shared widely. Finally, monitoring and evaluation of the program takes

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

25
place on the basis of ‘outcome mapping’, a tool developed by IDRC to assess changes in
behavior, actions and activities of the people who are directly involved in the project.

Both the ACCCA and CCAA are linked through joint UNITAR management of the two
programmes with ENDA as regional partner. The two are increasingly moving towards the
development of more specific and concrete adaptation measures by working closely
together with stakeholders and policymakers and by increasing the applicability and
relevance of climate change information. There are a handful of CCAA projects that are
linked to ACCCA through the support of ENDA-TM.

The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is a collaboration between UNEP, the World
Bank and UNDP, GEF is an independent financial organization that provides grants to
developing countries for projects that benefit the global environment and promote
sustainable livelihoods in local communities. Assessments of Impacts and Adaptations to
Climate Change (AIACC), was one of GEF’s key initial adaptation programs. AIACC
consisted of a global initiative developed in collaboration with the UNEP/WMO
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and funded primarily by the Global
Environment Facility (GEF) to advance scientific understanding of climate change
vulnerabilities and adaptation options in developing countries. The total budget was around
$8 million (with $7.5 million from the GEF, $300 000 from USAID, $100 000 from CIDA,
$50 000 from USEPA and $25 000 from Rockefeller, plus about $20K in-kind services and
co-financing by the AIACC partners reported at $1.8 million).  The program started in
2002 and the final reports were submitted in 2006. Similar to the NCCSAP, the AIACC
program took an approach to capacity building that was research driven. Twenty-four
regional assessments were carried out under the AIACC program, covering 46 countries.
Seventeen of the countries were in Africa.

The AIACC regional studies were diverse in their objectives, scientific methods, and in the
sectors and systems that were investigated. These include, among others, food security,
water resources, livelihood security, and human health. Despite this diversity, the studies
share a common assessment approach that places understanding vulnerability at the center
of the assessment.

Even though the program’s initial focus was on enhancing the scientific capacity of
developing countries, the program also sought to take the state of the assessments one step
further and make the research more relevant to local and regional priorities by engaging
stakeholders in the assessment process. The end result is that, to some extent, the AIACC
climate change assessments did engage effectively with policy processes. At the same time,
however, the final report does recognize the need for the further engagement of
stakeholders in the design and start up phases of the projects.

The association of poverty and low levels of development with high levels of vulnerability
is borne out in the AIACC studies.  Failures of development to raise people out of poverty
has resulted in people occupying highly marginal lands for farming and grazing, settling in
areas susceptible to floods and mudslides, and living with precarious access to water, health
care and other services. These conditions contribute to the high degree of vulnerability

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

26
found among the rural poor, as shown in the AIACC case studies in Botswana, Nigeria,
Sudan, Thailand, Lao PDR, Vietnam, the Philippines, Argentina and Mexico (Leary et al.
2008). Some urban squatter communities in Jamaica and the Philippines are more
vulnerable than other communities because of lack infrastructure, access to basic services
and social institutions to support collective efforts for reducing risks (Taylor et al., 2007,
Lasco et al., 2007).

DGIS (Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs/Directorate General for
International Cooperation): In recognition of the need to assist developing countries to
adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, DGIS launched the Netherlands Climate
Change Studies Assistance Program (NCCSAP) in 1996. Being one of the first climate
adaptation programs, the first phase of NCCSAP focused on creating a greater awareness
of climate change issues and building capacity among scientists and policymakers. The
program was active in 13 countries, including 5 countries in Africa.

The program put emphasis on the identification and quantification of impacts, especially in
the agricultural and water sector. In many of the country studies, mathematical models
were used to model possible future impacts of climate change on the agricultural and water
sector based on IPCC scenario outcomes. In the evaluation of the program, it was
recognized that the translation of the model outcomes into something useful for
policymakers remained problematic. According to the evaluators this was due to an
inability among the technical experts to effectively communicate the study results to the
stakeholders and to a lack of involvement of stakeholders in the early phases of the
program. Despite these shortcomings, the program did increase the capacity of scientists
and experts from the participating countries in understanding the impacts of climate
change in their respective countries.

In a follow up to the first phase of the NCCSAP, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign
Affairs/Directorate General for International Cooperation (DGIS) initiated a second phase
of the NCCSAP starting in 2003. Similar to the first phase, the second phase, which is
called NCAP, also aims to increase the capacity of developing countries to deal with the
adverse effects of climate change. However, whereas in the first phase the focus was
predominantly on understanding the biophysical impacts of climate change, the NCAP
phase puts more emphasis on understanding the vulnerabilities of people and livelihoods
and tries to influence policy processes. As such, the second phase of the program started to
move away from a unilateral focus on research. To stress this shift in focus, the name of
the program was changed to Netherlands Climate Assistance Programme.

The NCAP is active in 14 countries, including 5 countries in Africa. The topics and
approaches taken by the different country projects are much more diverse than during the
first phase, including water, health, agriculture and coastal zone management. The program
will end in June 2008.

Even though the NCAP and AIACC Programs have taken important steps to engage
stakeholders and influence policymaking processes, considerable challenges have remained
in translating the results into something that is useful and applicable for policymakers and

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

27
decision-takers. These challenges relate to the uncertainty that is inherent in climate change
projection data, the scale at which they are available and the relative lack of skills among
climate change experts to communicate the information to stakeholders. More recently,
two international research programs have been launched by DGIS which, among other
things, try to address these challenges.

Both GTZ and USAID referred to support material they were developing in order to help
a range of stakeholders interpret and use climate data (although neither of them is publicly
available yet).  These included ‘recipe books’ of where to access climate information, assess
the quality of information and develop risk management strategies as well as manuals that
intend to take users through a process of using climate change projections to map impacts.
There is also the recognition of the need to improve capacity on communicating climate
information and applying available climate information to responses.

Although START is not a donor, they manage a number of donor programs that relate to
climate change. Neil Leary of START highlighted a concern that many development
donors are supporting floods, famine and conflict disaster response, and do not see it as
their responsibility to support longer term research on climate science and adaptation, even
though this research could assist them in their preparation for disasters. At the same time,
many science agencies do not fund adaptation on the grounds that this will be covered by
development donors. These leaves something of a gap in the available for funding for
programs focused specifically on climate change adaptation. As Neil Leary observed, “It is
important to adapt now but this should be supported by science”, which requires science
agencies and donors to cooperate more.

This observation was born out by this study. Whilst climate scientists were generally
adequately funded, and traditional development agencies were all aware of climate change,
there were very few programs (CGIAR have requested funding for a program and MSU’s
CLIP program draws on local climate science) specifically focused on linking climate
science with adaptation efforts. Instead most current donor activity aimed to either assess
impacts and vulnerability to climate change in order to determine priorities, or integrate a
measure of “climate proofing”8 in development projects.

Interestingly, amongst the donors interviewed, agriculture was not always the main focus.
GTZ acknowledged that there has been a move away from focusing on agriculture to
rather focusing on issues around nutrition, food quality and getting to market.  SIDA is
exploring how adaptation to climate change can be integrated into poverty alleviation
approaches within different sectors. USAID has supported some agricultural-focused
activities and explored what additional challenges climate change may present. DFID
maintains an agricultural focus in East and Southern Africa but at the request of West
African governments has moved its focus in that region to urban issues.

8 “Climate proofing” whilst in common use in the development discourse, is not a term that the authors
support on the grounds that it is very difficult to predict all climate change impacts and then secure projects
and programs against climate change. Whilst most development institutions recognise this, the term endures.
“Climate preparedness” might be more appropriate.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

28
To some extent the gap in funding for adaptation specific activities is being filled by private
sector funders. There has been a discernible increase in private sector funding for
development and climate change activity. In the past five years the activities of the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, the Google Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation (to
name but a few) have moved beyond conventional corporate social responsibility and
begun to engage systemically with global issues. This has seen an increasing overlap with
the work of traditional donors such as DfID, USAID, SIDA and GTZ, but private sector
funders appear to have identified the specific need for climate change adaptation in
advance of the traditional donors.

Interviewees at DFID welcomed the involvement of large private sector players and cited
the relative flexibility, speed of mobilisation and innovation that they could contribute.
However, in the field of climate adaptation there is not yet a clear division of labor
and responsibilities between private donors and their more traditional public sector
counterparts.

4.2  Key research institutions
Since the ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
various international research programs have been undertaken in order to develop the
capacity of developing countries to cope with the effects of climate change. Typically, these
research programs are a collaborative effort of many different institutions involving
research institutes, NGO’s as well as governmental institutions. Many times, these
international research programs also involve studies on the impacts of climate change on
the agricultural sector.

Even though it is hard to generalize about the different programs, a shift seems to have
taken place in the past 18 months, from a primary focus on understanding the nature of
climate change towards the question about who is vulnerable and why. More recently, a
further shift is taking place towards an increased attention for policy-relevant applications
and the question on how to adapt. To some extent, these shifts are in line with the current
developments in the climate change debate which has gradually moved from a focus on
awareness raising about the reality of the problem towards a focus on how to respond.

Interestingly most of these institutions are reliant on financial and other support from non-
African sources, and as such there are very few “home-grown”, locally funded research
programs focused on climate adaptation in Africa.

IPCC and supporting research institutions: The intergovernmental panel on climate
change (IPCC) is the preeminent source of climate change information. The IPCC reviews
and collates research on a range of climate change related issues and records climate data in
its data distribution centre (DDC).

No African climate research institutions are involved in producing GCM models. Because
of the lack of the necessary tools, both human and instrumental, Africa depends, to a very
large extent, on institutions based in Europe and North America for its operational climate

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

29
forecasting capacity. Three institutions - NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, USA), UK Met Office/ Hadley Centre (United Kingdom) and CNRS
(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France) routinely make seasonal climate
forecasts for Africa based on their respective GCM models.

Among these three it is clear that the Hadley Centre, and specifically their dynamically
downscaled PRECIS model, is the most widely applied, especially in Southern Africa.

CSAG (Climate Systems Analysis Group) at University of Cape Town (UCT) is the only
African institution currently engaged in empirical downscaling activities for climate change.
In the last 6 months CSAG has made available downscaled data from 6 GCM AR4 (IPCC
Forth Assessment Report) models. The implication is that there is downscaled daily control
period data and climate projection data for multiple scenarios extending from 2050 until
2100 for the whole of Africa from 6 different GCMs. These data are available through the
CSAG website that requires registration but no charge.

The CSAG model enables users to compare outputs from the entire archive of IPCC
models, rather than relying on a single model's projections.  In spite of attempts to make it
accessible, the uptake of CSAG’s downscaled data has, to date, been fairly limited.

ACMAD (Africa Centre for Meteorological Applications for Development), based in
Niamey, Niger, is charged with gathering, collating and disseminating weather forecast
information. ACMAD operates in synergy and in a network with international partners,
partner institutions and focal points. The international partners include: France’s CNRS,
United Kingdom Met Office and United States NOAA among others. These institutions
provide the primary climate information to be collated and transmitted to the end users
within the various African countries. The partner institutions have specific sector and
regional responsibilities which require weather and climate information. Among such
institutions are AGRHYMET and ICRISAT. The primary focal points are the National
Meteorological Services of 53 African Countries. Focal points for ACMAD have also been
established within the operational structure of sub-regional economic groupings such as
ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) and SADC (South Africa
Development Community). The focal points are the primary recipients of the products
emanating from ACMAD, meant for end users in agriculture, energy, water resources and
other sectors within the various countries.

The data reception at ACMAD is achieved via a unique African Meteorological
Environmental Diagnostic Integrated System (AMEDIS). AMEDIS is a system for
receiving, processing and broadcasting meteorological information. It also consists of the
Display Units, SYNERGIE and MESSIR-VISION. SYNERGIE is a forecast tool
(software suitable for universal applications) for an easy and efficient access to a wide range
of observed and predicted meteorological data. It is versatile and adaptable to specific
situations and also further developments. The MESSIR-VISION is comparatively less
expensive and is operational on PC.  ACMAD is thus not yet qualified to conclusively
interpret the climate predictions from the model products. Climate prediction and weather
forecasting consist of complex and interactive processes on various scales of motion, even

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

30
smaller than considered on the GCMs. The degree of importance of the smaller-scale
circulation varies from one sub-region to the other. Thus the need for regional modeling
and downscaling of GCM outputs is yet to be adequately met from within Africa.

IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre (ICPAC):  ICPAC is a regional
climate centre based in Nairobi, Kenya. The Centre was established in 1989 as the Drought
Monitoring Centre in Nairobi (DMCN) in an effort to minimize the negative impacts of
extreme climate events like droughts and floods in the Greater Horn of Africa. In
recognition of the role of the Drought Monitoring Centre in the region, the IGAD
(Intergovernmental Authority on Development) Heads of State and Government, decided
to absorb DMCN as an autonomous specialized institution of IGAD. Hence, its name was
changed to the IGAD Climate Prediction and Application Centre.

The major goal of ICPAC is to improve and enhance the production and provision of
sector-relevant climate information and applications in the IGAD region. To that end,
ICPAC is producing decadal (10 day), monthly and seasonal forecasts and distributes them
to all National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of the participating countries, as
well as to sectoral users, including policy makers and planners in the health, energy,
agriculture and water sectors.

Whereas the focus of the centre is primarily on the production of information about
climate variability, ICPAC has recently also started to work on generating climate change
projection data, mainly through the use of the PRECIS dynamical downscaling model. In
October 2007, they organized a training workshop on PRECIS for all National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services (as well as some universities) in the region. The
training was funded and supported by the Hadley Centre and the International Centre on
Theoretical Physics (ICTP). In the near future, ICPAC intends to expand its activities and
services in the field of climate change and relationships have already been established with
the Climate for Development in Africa Program.

One of the flagship activities of ICPAC is the organization of the Climate Outlook Forums
that take place twice a year. During the Climate Outlook Forums, ICPAC presents the
most recent seasonal forecast and discussions can take place between climate scientists and
sectoral decision makers to assess and evaluate the usefulness and applicability of the
information that is provided by ICPAC. So far, ICPAC has organised 17 Climate Outlook
Forums.

Global Climate Observing System (GCOS):  In 2005, DFID and Defra jointly
commissioned a review of Africa’s science gap, and measures needed to reduce it, ahead of
the UK Presidency of the G8. The report showed that we know remarkably little about
Africa’s climate. Furthermore, the African climate observing system is the least developed
of any continent and is deteriorating. Scientific understanding of the African climate system
is, as a whole, low. The level of technical expertise available to support climate science in
Africa, and hence the level of activity, is very low (Wilby, 2007: 3).

CGIAR: CGIAR with a secretariat in Washington, has an exclusive agriculture (including
forestry, fisheries, aquaculture, water management) focus, and the bulk of CGIAR’s climate
change work is focused on Africa. CGIAR are about to launch a major Challenge program
aimed at integrating climate science. CGIAR recently submitted a proposal for a 10 year
study that will seek to close the gap between existing climate data at the regional level (from
the World Climate Research Programme, WCPR) and existing data that is available for
land-use and socio-economic change at the local level.

The proposal outlines 3 study sites initially, two of which will be in Africa (i) Eastern and
Sub-Saharan Africa (ii) Central and Western Africa. With regards to the human capacity
that it will mobilize, the proposed CGIAR study will draw on 5-6 researchers in each of
CGIAR’s 15 centres.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization: FAO in Rome has a
widespread presence in Africa. FAO’s overarching mandate is the support of food security
in Member Countries, but the organization undertakes a range of activities and recently
launched a climate change adaptation strategy aimed primarily at focusing the relevant units
and their efforts within the organization, but also at signaling internationally FAO’s intent
to engage in climate change adaptation. FAO has access to a wealth of agri-met data but
does not specifically apply climate change projections in its agricultural support programs.

ICRISAT: ICRISAT has used regional IPCC data to explore the impact of a 3 degree
warming on a variety of crops. Some of these (IPCC) data are obtained from the download
options available in the DDC (Data Distribution Centre).

Iowa State University: Over the last 7 years, Iowa State University's College of Liberal
Arts and Sciences has been developing (and applying) a regional climate change model
called the CAM-EULAG model. CAM-EULAG is a downscaling model which uses the
grid adaptive model which is based on the use of global models. The model has been used
in the USA to study hurricanes over the Atlantic Ocean. Babatunde Abiodun, a Nigerian
post doctoral researcher has been working with the team for the past 3 years and is
currently looking into adopting the model for use in Southern and Western Africa.  From
2008 he will be based part-time at CSAG at the University of Cape Town and work in
collaboration with them and in partnership with the Federal University of Technology in
Akure, Nigeria. Using climate change simulations, Babatunde hopes to see the impacts on
crops and water resources. The output data from the model will be useful for agricultural
development because farmers usually need to know when to start planting. Therefore,
based on the crop type, specific crop models can be produced as these are useful in
understanding what the expected yields of a particular crop can be. The model can also be
used for seasonal forecasting - usually over a period of 3 months.

SEI: Stockholm Environment Institute specializes in sustainable development and
environment issues at local, national, regional and global policy levels over its 6 centers
around the world. The SEI Oxford center in particular focuses on adaptive resource
management, particularly related to climatic risks, with expertise in water, food security and
livelihoods. Over the years the center has been involved in African agriculture through

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

32
numerous projects. One of the center’s current initiatives is developing a collaborative
platform for climate adaptation, called weADAPT, and building a network of Centers for
Climate Adaptation in Africa. This involves developing novel approaches to link risk of
future climate change, viewed within a multi-stressor context, to robust adaptation actions.

START International: Global Change SysTem for Analysis, Research and Training
research activities in Africa are consistent with critical environmental priorities in the
continent which include food and water security and vulnerability to climate change
impacts. START fosters regional networks of collaborating scientists and institutions in
developing countries to conduct research on regional aspects of environmental change,
assess impacts and vulnerabilities to such changes, and provide information to policy-
makers. START also provides a wide variety of training and career development
opportunities for young scientists.

NCAR: The National Center for Atmospheric research (NCAR) has used the
MAGICC/Scengen software package for future climate change prediction and particularly
drawing out the sources and magnitude of uncertainty (see Wigley, T. 2004).  Boulder
University are responsible for the MAGICC/SCENGEN model (currently in version 2.4),
based on DOEPCM GCM. The downscaled climate model applies a regionalization
algorithm. It takes emissions scenarios for greenhouse gases, reactive gases, and sulfur
dioxide as input and gives global-mean temperature, sea level rise, and regional climate as
output. The software also quantifies uncertainties in these outputs. The regional results of
the model are based on results from 17 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation
models (AOGCMs), which can be used individually or in any user-defined combination
(Hulme, et al., 2000).

Michigan State University: MSU’s Department of Telecommunications, Informational
Studies and Media, Michigan State University has a longstanding partnership with the
International Livestock Research Institute, Kenya. ILRI and MSU conduct several joint
programs in East Africa looking at local interactions of land use and climate.

MSU’s flagship adaptation project is called CLIP. Whereas many programs are increasingly
focusing on policy applications there are a couple of programs that continue to focus on
unraveling the complexities of the climate system and the ways in which it is interacting
with the biophysical environment. One such program is the Climate-Land Interaction
Program (CLIP).

The CLIP project has developed a unique coupled modeling system integrating human
behavior and biophysical factors that traces current and future land and climate change in
East Africa.  The framework allows geographically explicit analyses of the impacts of land
use and climate change on natural and agricultural systems.  Components include a regional
climate model for East Africa linked to a dynamic crop-climate model and to a land use
change model.  The system projects climate changes between 2000 and 2050 and includes
intra-daily, seasonal and yearly trends of many climatic variables.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

33
The CLIP system can be used to explore in more depth agricultural productivity as related
to climatological and soil constraints, as well as technological changes (e.g., crop variety
characteristics, fertilizer applications). As such the system allows to explore how
technological advances could be developed to better respond to recent and projected
climate changes.

University of Pretoria:  James Blignaut at the University of Pretoria’s Economic
Department has conducted his own research on the relationship between historical
temperature and rainfall and agricultural productivity in South Africa. The research makes
no use of global or regional climate projections.  The Centre for Environmental
Economics and Policy in Africa (CEEPA) located within the Department of Agricultural
economics, Extension and Rural Development at the University of Pretoria has been
running a project over the past few years that aims to improve national and regional
assessments of the economic impact of climate change on the agricultural sector of eleven
African countries, and to determine the economic value of various adaptation options. The
budget was US $ 1.32 million over 3 years.

4.3 Key practitioner institutions involved in climate adaptation
Institutions involved in actual adaptation initiatives appear to be fewer than those involved
in research, but a number of agricultural programs have designed adaptation components.

UNITAR is managing the implementation of the ACCCA programme with the scientific
support of a network of partners including the START International secretariat, TEA and
SEA START, CSAG, SEI and ENDA TM. The ACCCA programme is funded by the
European Commission, UK DEFRA, the Dutch NCAP through the ETC Foundation and
the International Development Research Center (IDRC). ACCCA seeks to enable and
support effective adaptation decisions that reduce vulnerability to climate change and
environmental change. The program is funding 19 country projects, 14 of which are
situated in Africa.  At the start of the project in 2006 € 2,000,000 was available and more
funding has been secured since then.

Building upon past experiences, the program emphasizes the importance of developing
strategies for communicating climate risk information in a way that is clear and
understandable for policymakers. Specific training modules have been developed to
support the project teams in developing such communication strategies. In addition, the
program is also working closely together with the Climate System Analysis Group at the
University of Cape Town to provide the country teams with downscaled data for carrying
out their vulnerability analyses.

CLIMDEV: The Climate for Development in Africa Programme (ClimDev) is currently
still in the proposal phase. Building on the GCOS Regional Workshop Program and a
follow up meeting in Addis Ababa in 2006, ClimDev Africa emerged as an African
development program to integrate climate information into development practices. The
objective of the Programme is to improve the availability, exchange, and use of climate
information and services in support of economic growth and achievement of the MDGs,
working at national, local and regional levels.  This will be achieved by improving climate

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

34
observing networks and services in Africa and by taking actions necessary to improve
climate-sensitive sectoral planning (including the agricultural sector) and decision-making at
different timescales through adoption and implementation of climate risk management
practices.  It is envisaged as a 3-phase program over an 11-year period.

In order to strengthen resilience to short-term climate variability and long-term climate
change, ClimDev-Africa will assess primary stakeholder needs in relation to climate
information and build capacity in institutions (public, private and civil) and people to use
climate knowledge more effectively in planning and decision-making. At the same time it
will build capacity in the African national meteorological and hydrological services
(NMHSs) and regional climate institutions to improve the quality and quantity of climate
observations and to enhance the climate information services required for adaptation to
climate variability and change.

The development of the Programme has gotten off to a slow start but recently substantial
progress has been made in preparing programme documentation.  There a number of
prospective donors that are planning to help support the programme.  In the period before
resources become available, the principal African partners (AU, ECE, and ADB) plan to
appoint an interim director who will be responsible for day-to-day startup and
implementation activities.  Although ultimate needs on a continental basis have been
estimated to exceed $800 million over ten or more years, the partners hope to raise about a
tenth of this figure for activities in the first few years.  The observations component of the
programme (i.e., improving observing systems for climate), is estimated at about $70
million.

FAO has conducted pilot studies in a number of member countries, typically with local
ministries of agriculture. The pilots have various aims, but broadly seek to combine better
use of information with improved technology and greater care for the natural environment,
so as to deliver enhanced and less risky agricultural production. Whilst FAO pilots are
beginning to consider the implications of climate change they do not make systematic use
of downscaled climate data in their planning.

SouthSouthNorth (SSN) operates both as a local NGO (SSN Africa) and as an
international network (SSN group) with a central office in Cape Town, South Africa. SSN
started in 1999 with a focus on climate change issues and is now in the second phase of a
4-year cycle funded by the Dutch that ends at the end of 2008. The budget for all SSN
work including adaptation is approximately $4 million.  They draw on climate change
projections by engaging with climate scientists but they are only now starting to see how
this information could be more strategically factored in to adaptation planning. One of
their adaptation projects in South Africa focuses on how seasonal climate forecast
information can be used by smallholder rooibos tea farmers and the potential agricultural
strategies that could reduce drought risk (Archer et al., 2008).

Other stakeholders that fall under this category but not outlined in detail include World
Vision, ENDA-TM, ALMP, AGRHYMET and FEWSNET.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

35
In addition there are a number of private sector consultancies that are now active in the
field of climate change adaptation, and some NGOs now sell their services in this field
alongside consultancies on a wide range of matters including social learning, emissions
management and trading, bioenergy and capacity building. Examples include OneWorld
Sustainable Investments, Environmental Resource Management (ERM) and D1 oils.  In
the course of the interviews the researchers were referred to a local consultancy Jabenzi,
which is affiliated to the University of Pretoria (James Blignaut). The company is active in
South Africa with a number of projects, and purports to restore natural capital so as to
protect livelihood and commercial farming activities against climate change. The company
does not base its activities on any specific climate data, but rather on an understanding of
the general phenomenon.

4.4  Producers and users of climate projection data in Africa
The section above has described institutions and where possible the climate data on which
they rely.  Figure 7 below illustrates the relationship between a select number of
interviewees and the key climate models.  This figure is not exhaustive but rather tries to
capture some of the salient relationships.  Noteworthy is the reliance by a large number of
end users on relatively few models, often models that provide data at a highly aggregated
spatial scale.

Chapter 5: Key Findings
5.1 The context of climate change adaptation in Africa
An important constraint to the effective adoption of climate change information in Africa's
agricultural sector is the lack of a comprehensive baseline understanding that characterizes
much of the current work. This lack of context manifests itself in three ways.

First, there appears to be a general tendency to isolate the impacts of climate change from
the broader context in which developments are taking place. There are several examples
where climate change is assumed to be causing negative trends without considering the
possible importance of other drivers. Peter Cooper from ICRISAT, for instance, noted an
example from the Machakos district in Kenya, where farmers blamed climate change and
decreasing rainfall for decreasing crop yields. After consulting the meteorological records,
however, it became apparent that rainfall had been increasing rather than decreasing.  It
was only after studying the broader context in more detail that it became clear that declines
in crop yields were attributable, in large part at least, to a government decision that reduced
fertilizer subsidies. In a similar way, many interviewees cited an increasing tendency among
pastoralists to ascribe climate change as the principal cause for a reduced availability of
pasture land. In doing so, however, pastoralists opt to downplay the detrimental effects of
overgrazing on pasture resources. What these examples clearly illustrate is the importance
of putting climate change in a broader context, taking into consideration other possible
(and often more directly probable) causes and explanations. Lack of understanding of these
other drivers of change might unintentionally lead to misdirected projects and, in the long
run, to maladaptation.

Secondly, respondents from both SEI and START highlighted the tendency for institutions
to adopt the adaptation mandate without first clearly understanding the climate change and
vulnerability context. Institutions tend to take certain climate impacts and vulnerabilities
for granted without looking at or even broadly understanding which climate parameters
and conditions are actually responsible for specific  vulnerabilities to climate change (versus
vulnerability to a range of other stressors including health, conflict, and governance, among
others) and how these parameters and conditions might change under future scenarios.
This might again lead to misdirected adaptation measures.

Thirdly, climate change adaptation efforts often fail to contextualize climate change risks
within the set of other climate information used in decision making, including historical
data, real-time data and traditional knowledge, all of which are currently used and available
to support decision making processes. In fact, there seems to be an apparent tension
between people working on future climate change and those focusing on current climate
variability. Climate change professionals tend to argue that by focusing on current climate
variability, agricultural decision makers might be caught off-guard by climate change,
particularly where the changes brought about by climate change are significant and can be
abrupt.  In modeling parlance this is referred to as responding to the climate change
“signal” rather than the climate variability “noise”.  In contrast, those who focus on climate
variability claim that, unless farmers in Africa can be helped cope better with current

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

37
climate variability, the challenge of adapting to future climate change will be daunting for
most and impossible for many.

It is clear that both views are important.  These are not mutually exclusive perspectives and
must be integrated in a seamless continuum. Both information about future climate change
and information about current climate variability should be placed within the broader
context of climate information in general and the value of each will depend on the specific
decision-making context. A small-scale farmer, for instance, will be more interested in
getting information about the expected rainfall in the coming season in order to make a
decision on what crop to grow. In this case, seasonal climate forecasts are the appropriate
resource (Ziervogel et al., 2006), and it should be unsurprising that these farmers do not
prioritize climate change projections in their decision making.  A crop breeder, on the
other hand, might benefit more from an understanding of climate change patterns in the
next 20 to 30 years because of the time delay between the development of new crops and
the actual distribution and use. In this case an understanding of climate change scenarios
would be beneficial.  Similarly a donor agency looking to promote sustainable rural
development should be interested in the climate change induced shifts in agro-ecological
zones over a 10 to 20 year period.

Over the past couple of years, climate change professionals have increasingly
acknowledged the importance of placing adaptation and the use of climate change
information in this broader context of other drivers and have paid more and more
attention to the local situation (Reid and Vogel, 2006; Ziervogel and Taylor, 2008).
Nevertheless, the past and current experiences of interviewees still point to the fact that
contextualizing climate change adaptation remains an issue of concern.

5.2 The state of climate change science in Africa
The last 10 years have seen considerable advances in the global science of climate change
modeling.  This is attributable in part to an improved understanding of the physical
processes governing the climate system as well as significant improvements in
computational capacity. These advances in climate change have improved the number,
quality and availability of GCM scenarios, with a few of direct relevance to Africa. The
GCM data are provided mostly by international organizations in the North.  These include
the UK Met Office’s Hadley Centre, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, USA) and CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France)
that all provide GCM data for Africa.

More important than the increased availability of GCM data, recent years have also seen an
increase in downscaling efforts, both dynamic and empirical, providing information at a
finer scale that, relative to the data produced by GCMs, is more relevant for research and
policymaking. This is because downscaled data, when analyzed appropriately, can provide
station level responses from GCM patterns, improving the temporal and spatial resolution
of available information.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

38
In Africa, however, the number of available downscaled datasets remains limited (especially
when compared to those available for Europe and North America) and they are the
product of an even more limited number of institutions and models. In fact the only
African institution that is generating empirically downscaled climate data based on the
IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report is CSAG at the University of Cape Town, but the
application and assessment of the utility of these data remains limited. Instead, many
researchers and practitioners continue to rely on output from a regional climate model,
PRECIS a dynamical model developed by the Hadley centre.

Another common trend in Africa is that most climate modelers tend to rely on only one
model output for their analysis, be it a GCM or a downscaled model. However, reliance on
a single model makes interpretation of the data vulnerable to errors and less robust than
multiple model approaches that permit comparison of results from different models.  Here
again, CSAG remains the only institution in Africa that is using a multi-model approach.
The results from CSAG’s downscaling efforts, which have been available online since late-
2007, are based on 6 different GCMs, with more models continually added.  This approach
is rapidly proving a valuable avenue for the exploring the climatological boundaries
(envelope) of climate scenario output, and represents some of the most detailed climate
data available for Africa.

While the barriers to expanding the number of downscaled climate change projections and
multi-model approaches in Africa are many, climate change modelers stressed the following
two.

Firstly, one of the main barriers to producing climate change information remains the lack
of reliable meteorological data. This is especially true for complex environments where
higher concentrations station data are needed to capture the complexity of the terrain.
While many African countries established extensive monitoring networks during much of
the 20th century to support daily weather forecasting, economic difficulties in the region,
not to mention civil wars, have led to the deterioration of these networks in recent years. In
fact, there are fewer rainfall monitoring stations in many African countries now than there
were 20 or 30 years ago (Patt, 2007). Ultimately, the lack of sufficient and clean historical
data renders the task of developing sound and robust downscaling models difficult.

The second barrier that has been mentioned by a number of climate modelers is the lack of
capacity both in terms of human resources and computational capacity to expand the
available databases. In particular, running dynamical downscaling models requires
considerable computational capacity and there are currently few computers available on the
continent which are powerful enough to run these models. Even when there is a super
computer available, there are very few people that have the necessary capacity to develop
and/or carry out downscaling activities. Apart from CSAG, there are a handful of other
institutions (including ICPAC and ACMAD) that have some basic infrastructure and
human resources in place but much more needs to be done to support theses institutes in
their evolution into fully-fledged climate modeling centers.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

39
Despite these barriers and shortcomings, many climate scientists and donors feel that the
state of climate science and modeling has reached a point where it is able to adequately
support local decision making processes (Neil Leary, Bruce Hewitson, Mirjam Palm, Sean
Doolan).  The critical focus, however should be placed on the development of sector-
specific methods and examples of how the climate data could be utilized to support robust
adaptation responses. It follows that the objective of the modeling community is to focus
on expanding the modeling efforts within Africa while working closely and
interactively with the users of model information in the interpretation and
understanding of climate data.

5.3 The use and application of climate change projection data in Africa
When it comes to the application and use of climate change projection data by researchers
and practitioners in the agricultural sector in Africa a number of observations can be made.

Firstly, it should be noted that there is a growing awareness about the issue of climate
change and many of the researchers as well as practitioners refer to the potential impacts of
climate change on their sector. However, while awareness of and references to climate
change are both increasing, much of these are based on media messages, or highly
aggregated data from the IPCC (DDC) and GCM models. The link between climate change
information and adaptation practitioners on the ground remains largely non-existent and
many adaptation practitioners in the agricultural sector still rely on generalized assumptions
about how the climate will change or derive very general information about climate change
and its impacts from the IPCC reports. As previously noted, the applications of existing,
improved resolution downscaled data to agricultural decision making is limited and, when
used, people tend to rely on only one model creating the risk of drawing
unsubstantiated, or at best sub-optimal, inference.

It also appears the case that the decision of what model or scenario to use is more than
often based, not on that model’s suitability to the research problem or adaptation
challenge, but its ease of access and use, with the extreme, but still plausible adoption by
simple word of mouth. Only rarely do researchers provide a science-based rationale for
choosing one model over another.

It is also clear from a review that climate adaptation and agricultural development activity
in Africa has been mobilized in response to foreign funding. In this sense the activity is
“supply driven”, and it is worth asking why there are so few programs conceived, planned
and funded from within Africa.  As Lorenz Peterson from GTZ emphasized, there needs
to be more focus on “demand driven” approaches that help to strengthen
cooperation and understanding between donors and those impacted by climate
change.

It is probably not an understatement to say that, despite a growing recognition of the issues
surrounding climate change among researchers and practitioners, there are very few
examples where the climate change model data have actually been used to inform decision-

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

40
making. Even within the research community, the actual use and interpretation of these
data is a recent advance (for example in some of the ACCCA projects).

The relatively few farmers who draw on the available climate projections is unsurprising.
Most farmers base their decisions on short-term weather and seasonal climate variability,
and stand to gain little from engaging with the complex world of climate projections and its
difficult to apply messages. In the case of plant breeders, policy makers, government
officials and donors, all of whom might be expected to adopt a longer-term focus, there is
a greater need to engage with and apply the available climate projections.

Both researchers and practitioners interviewed attributed the failure to use model
information to different dynamics:

• Lack of perceived relevance: Agricultural decision makers require information on a
range of matters in order to manage their businesses and programs. Making the link
between the type of data that are reported by climate change models (projections
up to 2100) and the type of data that they perceive as being important to their
activities (market demands, price, cost of inputs, labor availability, short-term
weather) is not always possible, or in some instances is not considered a priority.
Indeed, it posits a great challenge that is difficult to overcome.

• Gaining access to the right information remains a barrier: In spite of the fact that
many climate change projections are freely available, farmers and agricultural
decision makers do not know where to access this information and are not yet
accustomed to searching for this information.

• Issues of spatial and temporal resolution: The perception that climate projections
do not provide accurate information on the scale that land users and agricultural
decision makers require, remains a critical problem. This is particularly true of
issues related to temporal resolution. Because global and downscaled climate
models tend to provide information for time periods more than ten years in to the
future (typically from 2040s to 2100), farmers consider them inappropriate to their
immediate decisions.

• Skepticism over reliability: For farmers and other agricultural decision makers, there
are costs and risks involved when modifying their age-old activities and practices in
order to adapt to what models indicate will happen. Some farmers and program
operators noted that it makes more sense to react to observed (or historical)
changes in weather than to alter their activities based on a predicted climate risk. It
is further true that many decision makers are unable to contextualize the
uncertainty that is inherent in climate projections and therefore stick to what they
know. The reality is, however, that most models concur on the direction of
change in the near term. If used with the correct caution, these models can
provide a sound, scientifically grounded basis for decision making.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

41
Difficulty in interpreting the detail of climate data: A large number of farmers and
agricultural decision makers in Africa are aware of climate change and are painfully
aware of how it might affect them. They are, however, unable to mobilize an
adaptation response because they lack access to the appropriate tools and
interpretation techniques necessary to evaluate these impacts. Whilst farmers might
know that climate change is expected to make their country wetter on average, they
may not be directly aware of the cascading effects of these patterns on their day to
day activities.  For example, they may not understand the interaction between
precipitation and evapotranspiration that would dramatically alter soil moisture
conditions, planting dates, etc.  Nor would they understand the seasonal
distribution of increased rainfall or how the frequency or intensity of rainfall events
might alter.

• Specific user needs not addressed by the available climate data: Sean Doolan of
DfID pointed out in his interview, that the majority of climate data available has
been produced without due consideration of the specific (and admittedly diverse)
needs of the people that might need to use them, and as such is packaged in a way
that makes it difficult for practitioners to utilize. A farmer for example, may be less
interested in mean annual temperature but would be very interested in knowing
many years in a orchard life-time of say 25 years, they might expect to receive sub-
optimal rainfall or extreme temperatures, and how this number can be expected to
change. This might be impossible to infer from a reported temperature increase,
especially where the relationship between extremes and averages is not established.

• Lack of translators: Climate change projections have been developed by
climatologists yet there has not been sufficient growth in the people and
institutions able to interpret and communicate this information effectively.  These
translation skills (of so-called boundary organizations) are necessary in order to
engage a wide range of stakeholders with specific needs, as the limited number of
climate scientists in Africa are unable to develop their science at the same time as
meeting the growing need for data interpretation and communication.

• Climate data are accessed and understood but do not warrant an adaptation
response: In a few instances farmers and agricultural program leaders have used the
best available climate data in their assessment activities, their best decision was to
continue with their existing practices – i.e. not to adapt, yet. DfID, for example,
used PRECIS to screen the climate change impact on their portfolio of
development projects in Africa (including non-agricultural projects), and convinced
themselves whether correctly or not, that they did not need to take action now in
order to safeguard the benefits of these projects under a changing climate.

The barriers and constraints to the appropriate use of climate change projection data are
various but they all seem to point to a general lack of interaction and communication
between data producers and data users about information needs and the possibilities and
limitation of climate change projection data.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

42
Whilst climate change modelers believe they are able to provide the type of data and
information that can reliably inform local decision making and tend to attribute the limited
use of climate change information to a general lack of capacity among researchers and
practitioners to understand and apply the information, researchers and practitioners
maintain that available climate change projection data remain difficult to access, and
particularly difficult to apply with any measure of confidence to the types of decision that
they need to take.  This highlights again the need for translators.

Addressing this apparent disconnect between data producers and data users will be crucial
for advancing the use of climate projection data in the agricultural sector in Africa.

An overarching challenge for African countries grappling with practical steps in climate
change adaptation in agriculture, is to move beyond simply responding to UNFCCC and
GEF reporting requirements, and to begin engaging in the dynamics of future climates and
their implications. This will require the tailoring of climate information not only for
awareness raising but for guiding context-specific responses.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

43
Chapter 6: Recommendations
Based on the analysis and assessment in the previous chapters, five broad
recommendations are proposed that would improve the use and application of climate
change projection data in the agricultural development sector in Africa.

6.1 Improving and expanding climate change projection data in Africa
In order to improve and expand the availability of climate change projection data in Africa
a number of measures could be taken. Priority could be given to two types of measures.

Firstly, improved historical data is needed.  Historical data are paramount to the
examination and understanding of present climate variability and the implications of future
scenarios. Reliable, quality controlled historical climate data is often not available. Data
rescue activities that facilitate the digitization of archives currently on paper that are in
many cases in the hands of a range of stakeholders including meteorological stations and
farmers would improve this. It was noted by various interviewees that there are many so-
called “volunteer stations”, i.e. people or projects keeping records of weather data on a
voluntary basis. In Kenya, for instance, it is estimated that there are around 600 manned
and operated volunteer stations as opposed to only 25 “official” meteorological stations.
Often these data consist of long time series dating back as much as 40-50 years. Data
rescue efforts to convert these to workable/digital formats could be a very valuable
contribution to overcoming the current data constraints across Africa, improving the
quality of climate modeling and downscaling efforts.  GCOS is involved in a pilot project
starting in 2008 that addresses some of these data rescue issues in Africa.

Secondly, more capacity building efforts are needed to train climate scientists in Africa in
the development and application of downscaling techniques as well as in the use of multi-
model approaches. The START African Climate Change Fellowship Program aims to
address this gap, though more resources are needed to support graduate students and
provide subsequent employment opportunities for them at the post-doctoral level in order
to encourage their continued involvement and contribution to the development and
application of climate data.  Simultaneously, efforts should galvanize the establishment of
regional climate science centers in Africa that have the necessary computational and
institutional capacities to support climate modeling and downscaling activities.

6.2 Bringing data producers and data users together
More opportunities that join agricultural decision makers and climate scientists, and
provide an environment in which the skills necessary for closer collaboration between these
two groups could be created. These interactions should aim to:

• Improve data users' understanding of the possibilities and limitations of climate
change projection data and, as such build their capacity in interpreting and
applying the data in a correct and appropriate way.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

• Improve data producers' understanding about the information needs of
different user groups and, as such, enable them to tailor and package their data
in ways that are more useful for agricultural decision makers.
• Support translators who understand the challenges on both sides and can act as
information conduits.  The challenge with this task is that it requires skills that
many of the people currently engaged in climate change adaptation simply have
not developed. Specifically it requires the ability to translate science concepts
into those that users understand and can use, without distorting the concepts.
It also requires in-depth understanding of users’ needs and the potential
opportunities for using climate change projection data. The NCAP project in
Mali is beginning to address some of these concerns, but more efforts are
needed.

6.3 Improving capacity to interpret and apply climate data
The ability to draw correct inference from climate data from different sources, and to apply
these data in decision making could be standardized in the format of a training module.
The module could be made available to government officials, agricultural decision makers
and farmers as a means of strengthening their capacity to draw appropriately on available
data. The training module could also, of course, raise awareness of the available data as it
evolves.  Standard modules could be developed that would need country specific input to
make them relevant to local stakeholders.

6.4 Move from awareness raising to “proof of concept”
With the climate change debate gradually moving from a focus on awareness raising about
the problem to the development of actual adaptation responses, there is a need for
developing so-called “proofs of concept” – examples of agricultural decision makers that
have successfully drawn on climate change projection data to make decisions that have
improved agricultural productivity or human well-being. “Proofs of concept” could also
provide an opportunity to quantify and assess the potential value and benefits of using
climate change projection data as opposed to not using climate change projection data at
all. However, the long term nature of climate change will make “proof of concept”
examples hard to evaluate.

6.5 Platforms as the backbone for collaborative action and information sharing
The Oxford English Dictionary defines platform as “an opportunity for the expression or
exchange of views”. Climate change adaptation platforms could be seen as spaces for
collaborative action and information sharing.  These platforms could be developed in a
number of ways and fulfill an equally large number of functions:

• Platforms could provide a space where scientists, researchers, decision makers and
practitioners could share their knowledge and experience on climate change
adaptation and engage in a process of mutual learning.

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

45
• Platforms could function as repositories for local climate and weather information
in order to improve accessibility.
• Platforms could store information about tools and methodologies for assessing the
impacts of climate change and contribute to the development of appropriate
adaptation strategies.
• Platforms could be supported by material from workshops, fellowships, mailing
lists or e-conferences and collaborative outputs (including academic papers, policy
briefs and information sheets) where agricultural development practitioners engage
with climate scientists and/or climate information and document the process and
their learning.

By design a platform focused on climate change adaptation would have to be multi-
disciplinary,
including
agricultural
technicians,
climate
science
experts,
local
communities/civil society and donors, with obvious links to policy makers.  One example
is that of the weAdapt platform, which unites modelers, practitioners, donors and others
via a suite of new and innovative tools and methods, datasets, experiences and guidance
that are a resource for strengthening the capacity of those tasked with undertaking
adaptation.

One of the entry points to the platform is an interactive wiki space such as
(www.weAdapt.org),   which provides a structure and forum for reading about, discussing
and contributing to current thinking and experience on climate adaptation. It also includes
stories about living with climate variability and change from stakeholders in Africa,
challenges in developing NAPAs and suggestions on the use of climate information.  It is
label-free and institutions are encouraged to contribute by adding to existing pages or
developing new pages and components.  Recent experiences at the Conference of Parties in
Bali (2007) catalyzed partnerships that are certain to provide new and innovative avenues
for collaboration and sharing of climate data, experience, and expertise.

Another key element of the weADAPT platform is the Climate Change Explorer (CCE)
tool, with routines that permit access to, and exploration of attributes of the past and
projected future climate.  Indeed, the CCE tool development process itself is a testament to
the potential synergies to be gained from encouraging and supporting the interaction
between providers and users of information.

6.6 Focused donor funding
Many donor agencies are currently undergoing a similar process of gap analysis and
exploration of opportunities for coordination in order to direct future funding strategies.
Since most of these processes are still ongoing it is difficult at this moment to draw final
conclusions. Nevertheless some issues seem to be emerging.

In the past three years, donor agencies have shown an increasing interest in the issue of
climate change adaptation. In order to avoid the vagaries of supply driven interventions
that bear little reference to local needs and priorities, it is essential that the volume of

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

46
funding that is being released focus on the needs that seem to be emerging from within
Africa.

In order to do this it is important to support processes not projects.  Although projects
can facilitate the development of technical capacity to interpret and use climate
information, experience has shown that building capacity for the appropriate use of climate
information is a tedious and resource intensive process that takes time. Therefore it is
important that existing networks are strengthened and funding goes beyond project specific
skills creation to develop institutional capacity and stability, which requires a lot of inputs
from different stakeholders.

Presently some donors are supporting independent adaptation projects that first assess
impacts and vulnerability to climate change and then develop relevant adaptation strategies,
whilst others are focusing on development projects at the inception phase and integrating
climate throughout the project cycle.  Both approaches have their merits yet the aims of the
approach should be clearly stated.

Even though there is an institutional deficit in Africa, there are local and international
institutions starting to explore the field. Building on these existing institutions and
networks has many advantages as opposed to creating new ones. In general, existing
institutions can benefit from a long-standing presence in the region and they have typically
built up credibility and trust among stakeholders. Often they are already grounded in the
local reality with an understanding of the local needs and some knowledge about how to
deal with institutional constraints that characterize a certain country. Certainly this is the
case for Michigan State University’s work in East Africa which has been able to build on
long-standing affiliations through the Climate-Land Interaction Program (CLIP) and has
undertaken some ambitious modeling of the relationships between local agricultural
practices and climate. Some people have argued that supporting such institutions that have
emerged from local needs is more likely to continue and be sustainable although the moral
hazards of international support for local institutions should be fully acknowledged in these
processes.

Finally, there is an increasing number of private sector donors such as the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation, The Google Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, and a
burgeoning group of consultants and NGOs targeting research and implementation
opportunities.  To ensure an effective response and avoid overlap, discussions will need to
take place between the existing donors and these new players in order to identify roles and
responsibilities.

6.7 Placing climate change within the broader African development context
This study has provided an overview of the type of institutions and activities dealing with
climate science, agricultural development and adaptation in Africa. It has highlighted the
challenges associated with producing, disseminating, interpreting and using climate data.  In
addressing these challenges it is important to recognize the context in which climate change
should be addressed in Africa – as urgent yet one of many other development challenges

Climate Change and Adaptation in African Agriculture

47
that Africa is dealing with.  However, a common sentiment as reiterated by UN Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon’ address to the tenth African Union Summit in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia (AU Summit, 2008), is that “our best efforts in peace, development and human
rights will be undermined if we do not effectively address the threats posed by climate
change.”
