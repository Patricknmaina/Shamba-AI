Background
Development challenge
Tomato is one of the most popular and widely grown vegetables in Kenya, cultivated in almost all the 47
counties. However, despite its socio-economic significance, the production of this key crop is constrained
by numerous abiotic and biotic factors, among them insect pests. Since its arrival in Kenya in 2014, the
tomato leaf miner, Tuta absoluta, has become the most serious threat to sustainable tomato productivity,
causing between 50-80% yield loss if no control method is applied.
Approximately 98% of Kenyan farmers suffer from T. absoluta attacks in their tomato fields each season.
To manage this pest, smallholder vegetable farmers typically rely on insecticides and spray between 6-10
times per season. As a result, T. absoluta is developing resistance to pesticides, leading to production
losses and increased input costs. A study by CABI on farmers’ coping strategies towards the tomato leaf
miner showed that 96.5% of farmers apply pesticides but only 27% report success. Furthermore, in ad­
dition to not using or improper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) many farmers do not observe
pre-harvest intervals resulting in pesticide residues entering the human food chain, posing health risks to
applicators and consumers respectively.
Biological control methods, therefore, becomes an important component in the integrated management
of this pest. They can offer a safer, more cost-effective and environmentally-friendly management option
for smallholder tomato farmers.
The solution
CABI joined forces with world-leading biological control specialist Koppert Biological Systems to
step-up a more sustainable fight against the tomato leaf miner Tuta absoluta. The initiative focused on an
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, including use of a predatory mirid Macrolophus pygmaeus
(MIRICAL), pheromone trap system (Pherodis plus Traps, and Trianum-P for the management of soil-
borne pathogens, together with other good agricultural practices.
Purpose of the manual
This training manual is as a result of the collaborative work between CABI and Koppert Biological Sys­
tems. The objective of this manual is to guide trainings offered to tomato famers on sustainable tomato
production with key focus on the management of the tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta), based on lessons
learned from the project. The manual also provides information about other key tomato pests that farmers
are likely to encounter on their farms and how they can be managed within the IPM framework. The infor­
mation provided is applicable to tomato farming in both greenhouses and open fields.

Objectives
1.
Understand the importance of tomato production, where the crop is grown and contribution

to the economy of the country
2.     	 Know the different production requirements of tomato in the open field, and in green houses
3.     	 Know available tomato varieties, their growth habits and, pest and disease tolerance
Module 1: Introduction
Tomato production in Kenya
•
Kenya is one of sub-Saharan Africa’s top tomato producers and grows more than 400,000
tonnesw of the fruit every year. Tomato is cultivated in all 47 counties in Kenya.
•
Tomato is the second most valuable vegetable in terms of production and value after potato in Kenya.
•
Tomato meets domestic and nutritional food requirements.
•
Tomato generates income and creates employment for both the rural and urban populations in Kenya.
•
However, farmers are getting up to 80-100% crop losses due to this insect pest and disease complex.
Tomato classification
•
Scientific Name: Solanum lycopersicum
•
Order / Family: Solanaceae
•
Common name: Tomato
•
Local Names: Nyanya (Swahili)
•
Tomato is both a fruit and vegetable
•
When eaten RAW it is a FRUIT and when COOKED it is a VEGETABLE
•
Scientifically, a fruit is the reproductive body of a seed plant. Simply “anything on a plant by which
means the plant gets its seeds out into the world, is a fruit".
•
Vegetables- are a wide range of plants whose parts are edible like roots, stems, and leaves.
Uses of Tomato
•
Tomatoes are mainly eaten raw (for fresh consumption, in salads and starters).
•
Are also processed industrially to produce, tomato paste, peeled tomatoes, tomato ketchup,
tomato juice and canned tomatoes among others.
What is tomato, a fruit or a vegetable?
Content
Ecological Requirements for tomato production
•
Altitude: Tomato can be cultivated up to 2,000 metres above sea level
•
Rainfall: Tomato performs well in areas that receive over 600 mm of rainfall annually. The
rainfall should be well distributed throughout the growing season.
•
Temperature: Tomato performs well in warm climatic conditions. The optimal day and night
temperature range is 20 – 25°C and 15 – 17°C, respectively
•
Soil: Tomato requires well drained sandy loam, or clay loam soils. The optimal soil PH range is
6.0 – 7.5.

6
Nutrition Requirements for tomato production
•
Soil testing – Helps the farmer in choosing the proper nutrition regime for his or her tomatoes
in order to optimise crop production; protect the environment from contamination by runoff and
leaching of excess fertiliser; save money by applying only amount of fertiliser needed.
•
Primary nutrients – They include nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (pH is important in
fertilizer choice; emphasize on potassium on fruit setting and quality).
•
Secondary nutrients – They include calcium, magnesium and sulphur (highlight the impor­
tance of calcium and prevention of blossom end rot).
•
Micronutrients – They include zinc, boron, molybdenum, copper etc (Emphasize the im­
portance of boron- cell wall formation and stability, maintenance of structural and functional
integrity of biological membranes, movement of sugar or energy into growing parts of plants, and
pollination and seed set).
•
Soil microbial amendments – They include beneficial micro-organisms such as Bacillus
subtilis, Trichoderma species and Mycorrhiza (Panoramix-GR). These are important for nutrient
solubilisation.
Timing is very critical in the application of nutrients.
Tomato production practices
Tomato production in Kenya is conducted in either open field or greenhouses. Productivity of to­
mato under either system varies, as well as management regimen. Farmers choose either system
based on the available resources.
Open field tomato farming
•
This is where tomato is grown in open field and relies on natural climatic conditions for growth.
•
It can be either rainfed or irrigated.
•
Most smallholder farmers in Kenya grow tomato in open field.
Greenhouse farming
•
In greenhouse farming, horticultural crops (flowers, fruits and vegetables) are grown under con­
trolled climatic conditions.
•
Greenhouse farming is one of the modern technologies that ensures year-round production.
Selection of tomato variety to grow
The following should be considered before selecting a variety to cultivate as the choice of best
variety to grow is critical for good yields:
•
Growth Habit - determinate (bush) vs indeterminate (climbing).
•
Disease resistance/tolerance: indicated by initials after variety name e.g.) “F” for Fusarium wilt,
“N” for Nematodes.
•
Fruit quality- (shape, size & colour). Market requirement will determine fruit type. Those for pro­
cessing have an intense red colour & more solid. Those for fresh market consumers pay attention
to the shape, colour & durability in storage.
•
Hybrid or Open Pollinated Variety (OPV).
•
Hybrid seeds give higher yields but are more expensive.
•
Adaptability and reliability to climatic conditions.
•
Plant quality (firmness).
•
Availability and suitability to the growing conditions.
•
Production practices- open field or greenhouse.
Note to the trainer

7
•
It is important to note that no single variety will combine all the charac­
teristics above
•
Some tomato varieties are preferred for open field farming while others
are for green house farming. For example, the bush types (determinate)
varieties would take up lots of valuable floor space in a greenhouse
whereas the indeterminate varieties make best use of the vertical space
and are, therefore, far more productive in terms of total yield and the
best tomatoes to grow in the greenhouse.
Common tomato varieties in Kenya and their characteristics
•
Farmers in Kenya grow a wide range of tomato varieties including cherry tomatoes. It is wise to
avoid varieties that offer no resistance to serious diseases prevalent in your area. Table 1 shows
the most common varieties in Kenya and their characteristics.

Module 2: Tomato good agricultural practices

Objectives
•
Obtain knowledge about tomato good agricultural practices for achieving a higher yield and quality tomatoes.
social acceptability and food safety and quality.
The concept of GAPs has evolved to address the
concerns of different stakeholders about food
production and security, food safety and quality,
and the environmental sustainability of agricul­
ture.
Producers need to apply good agricultural prac­
tices from seed selection to harvesting to ensure
quality, and thus higher incomes.
Good agricultural practices improve yield
Good agricultural Practices (GAP) ensure; economic viability, environmental sustainabilty,
A farmer in Kenya displays his tomato harvest (Photo: Maina Waruru)
Good agricultural practices (GAPs) are a set of principles, regulations and techni­
cal recommendations applicable to production, addressing human health care and
environment protection.
By using GAPs farmers and their families obtain healthy and good quality food to assure their nutrition and
nourishment, generating a value added in their products to access markets in a better way; consumers
enjoy better and safe quality food, with sustainable production; and the population in general, benefits from
a better environment.
When applied throughout the cropping season, GAPs are an important component for achieving high yield
and better-quality tomato. GAPs also help to manage pests and diseases, and are important in integrated
pest management (IPM) strategy (see module 6 on IPM).
GAPs in tomato production, what is the best place to start?
Land preparation
Ensure appropriate land selection and preparation to enhance crop growth. The following are
important considerations:
•
Know the history of the field, recognize more fertile lands and with availability of water.
•
With the support of a technician analyze the type of soil and its depth for good growth of the roots.
•
Undertake soil testing to understand the level of nutrients to guide fertility management plan.
•
When preparing land for planting, hardpans or compacted soil should be thoroughly loosened by
deep ploughing to enable the root system to spread to a depth of 40 – 60cm.
•
The field should be near a reliable water source as tomatoes require frequent watering.
•
Low soil pH can be corrected by addition of Lime. High soil pH or sodic soils remediation is done
by application of Gypsum.

10
•
Manage soil-borne pathogens and nematodes by soil solarization after a deep plough, or drench the
soil with Trianum-P or other registered products.
•
Regular ridges should be done about 30 - 35 cm high and 25 – 30 cm wide.
Simple soil sampling guide
Step 1: Using a hoe or panga obtain thin slices of soil from at least 13 randomly distributed
spots in a given field. See illustration below as a guide:
Step 2: Mix all the soil taken from the field into one composite sample. Spread soil on newspa­
per in a warm room to air dry overnight. Do not heat.
Step 3: Take 1 cup of representative sample and place in the soil mailing kit bag. Send the soil
sample and submission form to your testing lab.
Note:
1. Avoid taking samples from areas such as lime piles, fertilizer spills, ant hills, gate areas, live
stock congregation areas, poorly drained areas, dead furrows, fertilizer bands, old fence rows,
or any other unusual areas.
2. Do not use galvanized, soft steel or brass equipment if analysis for trace metal analyses is
desired. Clean all tools between sampling
Seed selection
•
Use certified disease-free seed of suitable varieties.
•
Use varieties tolerant or resistant to pests and diseases. (see module 1 for some tomato varieties).
Raising seedlings
Farmers are advised to raise their own seedlings or buy clean seedlings from certified nursery
operators. Sourcing for seed from unknown sources can be a source of pests and diseases,
including soil-borne diseases. The following should be followed when raising own seedlings:
The following should be followed when raising own seedlings:
•
Seedlings should be raised in a nursery large enough to meet the farmer’s requirement for planting materials.
•
Dimensions: The ‘bed’ should be 1 meter wide, 10-20 cm between seedling rows. If you need
another ‘bed’ – make them at least 50 cm apart.
•
Nursery trays can also be used for a small garden.
•
After sowing, water the nursery regularly. Avoid over watering.
In situations where farmers can practice minimum tillage in tomato pro­
duction systems, this is encouraged to keep the disturbance of the soil
and loss of organic matter to a minimum.
Note to the trainer

11
•
Drench the nursery with Trianum-P shortly after germination for preventive control of soil-borne
pathogens such as Fusarium. (More details provided in Module 6)
•
Harden the seedlings 1 – 2 weeks before transplanting: by reducing the frequency of watering and
gradually exposing the seedlings direct sunlight.
•
Control insects such as whiteflies and aphids using biopesticides. Examples of biopesticides that
can be used and available in Kenya are:

o Nimbecidine- active ingredient is Azadirachtin (neem based)

o Mycotal ( Lecanicillium muscarium)

o Biocatch - active ingredient is Lecanicillium muscarium
•
Insects can be blocked from reaching the seedlings by use of an insect proof net
(see picture of a simple netting)
•
Emphasize the need to manage soil-borne pathogens in the nursery. Tria­
num-P is a low risk option and is easily available in Kenya.
•
Since tomato is usually consumed as a fruit, it is important for farmers
to use low risk products.
•
Emphasize the use of biopesticides and safe handling of plant protection
products.

Transplanting stage
•
Seedlings are transplanted 30 – 45 days after seed sowing.
•
Recommended: transplanting should be done either early in the morning or late in the evening.
•
Recommended spacing: ranges from 75 – 100 cm (between rows) and 40 – 60 cm (between
seedlings) depending on tomato variety.
•
Correct spacing produces short, stocky plant with good roots system. Plant population per acre
ranges between 6,666 to 13,333 plants depending on plant spacing.
•
Avoid transplanting seedlings near to an old tomato crop.
•
Ensure that a new field is sited uphill, particularly where surface irrigation is used to avoid spread
of soil-borne diseases.
•
Plant border rows of coriander, fenugreek, maize, marigold, millet, pigeon pea or sorghum. They act as
windbreaks; fenugreek and coriander are repellent to whiteflies, and provide refuge for natural enemies.
•
Apply organic manure, mixing it well with the soil before transplanting.
Note to the trainer

12
Single stake - A single, 8-foot-long stake is driven about 2 feet into the ground
approximately 3 to 4 inches from each plant. Tie the plant to the stake with strips
of old nylon hose or sisal about every 12 inches up the stem. Tie the material in
a loose figure 8, with the stake in one loop and the stem in the other. The roots
of the tomato plants may be injured if the stakes are put in later in the season.
Field management
Watering: Tomato is sensitive to insufficient water especially immediately after transplanting,
during flowering and fruit development. So, plants should be provided with adequate water. How­
ever, tomato plants are equally sensitive to water logging. If flooded, fields should be drained
within 1 – 3 days. Furrow and drip irrigation are the most effective methods for providing irrigation
water.

* Furrow irrigation minimizes spread of fungal diseases, such as “Early Blight” but may

spread soil borne diseases such as bacterial and Fusarium wilts.

* Drip irrigation on the other hand is efficient on water utilization.

* Overhead irrigation encourages spread of diseases such as “Early Blight”.

* Watering can irrigation can also be used, it is only suitable for small plots.
Weed management: generally, keep the field weed-free as much as possible to avoid com­
petition for nutrients, sunlight and moisture. Weeds also provide habitat for pests and diseases.
Avoid bruising the roots during weeding by using appropriate weeding tools. Weeding tomato field when the
soil is wet can increase the spread of some bacterial (Bacterial Wilt) and fungal (Fusarium Wilt) diseases.
Fertiliser application: Proper fertilization provides the required nutrients to the plant and this
gives the plant a competitive ability to tolerate pest damage, and achieve higher yields for farmers.
If possible, farmers can obtain technical support for soil testing to inform their nutrition regime.

— Apply a compound fertilizer that has adequate amounts of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and

Potassium at transplanting, and 30 –45 days after seed germination at the rate of 80 kg/

acre =10g/hole =2 bottle tops/ hole).

— Where possible obtain a fertilizer providing secondary and micronutrients.

— Top-dress with fertilizer such as CAN (Calcium Ammonium Nitrate) in 2 splits at 40 kg/

acre and 80 kg/acre). This is equivalent to 5g (1bottle top) and 10g (2 bottle tops) per

plant in each application respectively.

— Apply adequate amounts of Potassium and Boron during the top-dressing exercise.

— Top dressing should be done at 4 and 8 weeks after transplanting.

— Application method should be-circular band around the stem (placement method)

using e.g. a bottle top.
Training and staking: Staking tomatoes improves fruit quality by keeping fruit off the ground
and increasing air flow through the plant. A structured training system can also make tomatoes
easier to harvest.

* Staking systems are usually installed 2-3 weeks after transplanting or when plants

reach a height of 12-15 inches.

* Farmers can select any of the two most common training systems; stake and weave

and Trellis [illustration -3]
Single stake

13
Stake and weave - Wooden or metal stakes are driven
between every other tomato plant. Lines of twine are
strung between stakes on either side of the plants to pro­
vide support.
Trellising - A system used to train indeter­
minate tomatoes. It consists of heavy gauge
wire strung horizontally across the top of widely
spaced, sturdy (3-6 inch) support posts.
Lengths of twine are dropped from this top
wire and secured to the base of each tomato
plant (or to a bottom wire, if used). Support
posts should stand 5-6 feet above the soil and
be spaced 12-20 feet apart down the row.
The growth habit of your specific variety will help determine stake length.
Indeterminate varieties require longer stakes (5-6 feet) than determinate
varieties (3-4 feet).
Pruning: Good pruning achieves the optimum balance between vegetative growth and fruit
production. Pruning helps increase fruit size, fruit quality and yield, so it is important to strike
the right balance between reducing vigorous foliage and stripping the plant. When pruning:

— Remove side shoots, extra flowers, fruits and diseased leaves.

— Sterilize pruning blades by use of chlorine bleach (Jik) and water at a ratio of 1:1.

— Use of unsterilized blades can lead to spread of diseases e.g. Tomato Mosaic   Virus

and Bacterial Wilt.

Pest and disease identification capacity limited for smallholder farmers
Although tomato is among the promising commodities in horticultural production in Kenya and
over the years production has intensified, farmers are not seeing in­
creased yields.
Analysis of plant clinics data from 14 counties in Kenya by CABI has
shown that this is due to a myriad of constraints related to climate
change and soil health, but most importantly due to plant pests and
diseases.
While farmers in Kenya apply various methods for the control of the
pests and diseases, capacity for proper identification remains a chal­
lenge to effective control of the problems. Some insect pests/diseases
can not be identified with naked eyes and require use of hand lenses.
In some cases, farmers may confuse nutritional deficiencies to pest/
disease symptoms.
As such, farmers tend to indiscriminately apply chemical sprays with the
associated negative health and environmental impacts.

It is important for farmers to clearly identify pests and diseases affecting their crop,
which guides in making decision on which management practice to use. Depending on
the available time, the trainer may choose to cover each category of pests separately to
give more time for discussion with farmers. The categories as indicated in this manual
are; soil pathogens, insects pests, and diseases.
•
Emphasize the importance of using certified or clean planting materials, good agri­
cultural practices and field sanitation as a preventive measure for pest and disease
management.
•

Table 2: Problems from the soil (Soil borne diseases of tomato)
Disease
Symptoms
• The lower leaves of the plant usually wilt, turn yellow and die,
mostly on one side of plant.
• One or more branches may exhibit such symptoms.
• Affected stems and petioles, just above ground level, show a
reddish-brown discolouration of the water conducting tissues,
when cut diagonally.
• It is reported as the most serious problem for tomato production
in the tropics.
• The disease causes rapid wilting and death of the entire plant
without any yellowing or spotting of leaves
• Plant wilts while still green.
• Total collapse of the plant usually occurring when temperatures
reach 32 °C and above.
• For diagnosis, conduct a field bacterial streaming -test:
• Damping-off occurs when seedlings die before they have pushed
through the soil, resulting in patches that appear to have germinated
poorly.
• Seedlings may also emerge but fall over and die some time afterwards.
• The base of stem of affected seedlings become wet and brown.
• Root-knot nematodes are very destructive to tomatoes.
• They cause small lumps known as root knots or galls on the roots.
• Heavily infected roots are severely distorted and swollen and with
time they rot.
• The affected plants get stunted, wilt, yellow or die in hot weather.
• The plants, in most cases, just wilt with the foliage still green - some
times without yellowing.
• Nematode problem is primarily due to improper crop rotation.
• Monitor and scout for symptoms regularly.
• Avoid locating the seedbed on previously infested field, overcrowding of seedlings,
excessive fertilizer application or excessive watering to young seedlings while still at
nursery bed.
• Use certified seeds/ clean planting material.
• Use Trianum-P (a preventive Bio-fungicide).
• Apply products containing Metalaxyl + Mancozeb.
• Monitor and scout for symptoms regularly.
• Rotate tomato with poor or non-hosts crops e.g. cereals, leguminous crops etc.
• Do not locate seedbeds where susceptible vegetables (e.g. okra, sweet pepper, egg
plant, Irish potato, carrot or cucurbits) have been previously grown.
• Use tolerant or resistant tomato varieties.
• Use nematode- free seedlings.
• Maintaining high levels of organic matter in the soil (manure and compost) improves
crop heath, and encourages growth of microbes that reduce nematode activity.
• Neem has naturally-occurring compounds that kill nematodes. Mix neem cake in the
soil to increase the organic content and kills nematodes.
• Soil solarisation.
• Fallowing land gradually reduces soil population densities of nematodes.
*  Cut a stem or rhizome and suspend it in a glass of water.
After a few minutes, you should be able to see a thin, milky
line of bacteria streaming out of the cut stem, veins and
tissues. Fig 3.1.
• Monitor and scout for symptoms regularly.
• Use resistant tomato varieties (refer to Table 1 in the Introduction section).
• Use certified seeds/ clean planting material.
• Do not locate seedbeds on land where Fusarium wilt is known to have occurred.
• In acidic soil, raise the pH by applying lime.
• Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilisation and control root-knot nematodes.
• Use of Trianum-P (a preventive fungal Bio-fungicide- (see module 6).

Pest
Symptoms
• Caterpillars of the African bollworm feed on leaves, flowers and
the tomato fruit.
• The damage on the leaves reduces leaf area, impacting plant
growth and productivity.
• Flower feeding prevents fruit formation.
• Caterpillars bore holes into the fruit and eat the inner parts, caus-
ing damage to tomato fruit.
• Excrements (faeces / waste) of the feeding caterpillars are evi  dent
on damaged plant parts.
• It becomes difficult to control larvae once they have entered the fruit as they are
protected by the flesh of the tomato fruit.
• Monitor and scout regularly for presence of the pest, look out for eggs and small
caterpillars.
• Prevent infestation in the next crop by; (1) Planting the tomato crop away especially
from maize and cotton (2) Remove and destroy infested fruits and other plants. (3)
plough soil after harvest to expose pupae to sunlight and natural enemies. (4) Rotate
tomatoes with onions or cereals like rice where possible.
• Conserve natural enemies such as Trichogramma, and predators (syrphid flies, lady
bird beetles) to reduce pest populations. This can be done by reducing or judiciously
using synthetic pesticides, trap cropping, intercropping etc.
• Use low-risk pest management options such as biopesticides e.g. Nimbecidine or
Bt- based products.
• Ensure proper weed management to reduce pest hiding places.
• On small plots, handpick and destroy eggs and small caterpillars.
• Use registered compatible chemicals e.g. Cyhalothrin, Lambda-cyhalothrin etc.
Management Measures
African Bollworm

• The leaves are injured as a result of the mites sucking out
valuable substances from the underside of leaves causing
speckling and tarnishing and eventual leaf fall.
• Infested plants look unhealthy and will have a dusty appearance
to the undersides of their leaves Under severe attacks they will
cause stunted growth and reduce yields.
• The mites and its webbing, just visible to the eye, can be seen on
the underside of the leaf.
• Spider mites may also cause spots on the fruit.
• Crops are weakened by the feeding of large numbers of white
flies, whilst the sooty mould impairs leaf function.
• Leaf distortion and stunting if the attack is very early.
• However, by far their major importance as crop pests is their
transmission of diseases of plants e.g. tomato mottle, and toma
to yellow leaf curl virus.
• Attacked leaves have a silvery sheen and show small black spots
(thrips excrements).
• Under heavy infestation attacked buds, and flowers usually fall
off.
• Attacked fruits show speckling and small necrotic patches on the
surface affecting fruit quality.
• Fruits may become deformed.
• Thrips feed on tomatoes at all stages, but their feeding on seed-
lings is particularly damaging.
• The primary damage caused by thrips to tomatoes is the vector
ing of Tomato spotted wilt virus.
• Regular scouting of the crop to determine the presence of the pest and the level of
infestation in an early stage.
• Natural enemies are effective in the control of Spider Mites. e.g. Phytoseiulus persimilis
by Real IPM or Spidex by Koppert or Phytotech by Dudutech.
• Inter-planting tomatoes with garlic or onion, field hygiene (as trap crops) will help reduce the pest.
• Plant resistant cultivars.
• Adequate irrigation is important, because water-stressed plants are most likely to be damaged.
• Dusty conditions often lead to mite outbreaks; Apply water to pathways and other dusty
areas at regular intervals.
• Avoid broad-spectrum chemical pesticides.
• Use of parasitic wasps Encarsia formosa, Eretmocerus spp. Or predatory bugs forex
ample Macrolophus
• Encourage the build-up of natural enemies like lacewings and ladybird beetles that feed
on whiteflies and other pests through plant diversification and avoiding broad-spectrum
pesticides.
• Use of microbials eg Lecanicilium muscarium (Mycotal), Beauveria bassiana.
• Use of yellow Horiver sticky traps.
• Use of botanicals such as Neemroc, Nimbecidine, Neemark EC, and Achook 0.15 EC
which are neem-based.
• Encourage build-up of predators such as ladybird beetles, lacewings and spiders.
• Check plants daily in the nursery, and crop borders in the field. Pay careful attention to
flowers and flower buds.
• Destroy thrips pupae in the soil to reduce subsequent thrips populations.
• Plough and harrow before transplanting to expose pupae in the soil from previously infested
crops to natural enemies and desiccation.
• Soil solarisation and flooding previously infested fields prior to planting / transplanting
destroy a large proportion of thrips pupae present in the soil.
• Spray botanical pesticides e.g. Neem.
• Use of blue or yellow Horiver sticky traps.
• Use of compatible chemicals.
• If possible, avoid planting tomatoes next to onions, garlic, or cereals, because high thrips
numbers often build up on these crops.
• Avoid fields near greenhouses where ornamentals (cut flowers) are grown because these
plants serve as hosts for the virus and thrips.
• Discard any infested plants by securely bagging and putting in the trash.
• Trap using blue sticky traps to kill or reduce their numbers.

Table 4: Major diseases and disorders of tomato
Pest
Symptoms
• Leaf spotting first appears early in the season on the oldest
leaves and progresses upward on the plant.
• Spots on the stem resemble those on leaves but tend to be more
elongated and the circular or ring-like pattern is more pro

nounced.
• Dark, leathery, sunken spots may develop on the fruit at the
points of attachment to the stems.
• These spots may also show concentric markings like those on
foliage.
• Irregular, greenish-black, water-soaked patches on the leaves
• The spots soon turn brown and many of the infected leaves wither,
yet frequently remain attached to the stem.
• Under moist conditions white fungal growth may be seen on the
underside of leaf spots.
• In damp weather the disease spreads so rapidly, that almost all
the foliage is affected, and the plants look as though scorched.
• Unlike other fungal diseases, this plant problem does not over
winter in the soil or on garden trash. Instead the spores are intro
duced by infected tubers, transplants or seeds. Winds will also
carry the disease from nearby gardens.
• Affected plants exhibit a mottling with raised dark green areas
and distortion of the youngest leaves.
• Under conditions of high temperature and high light intensity, the
mottling is frequently severe.
• Under conditions of low temperature and low light intensity, the
mottling is not noticeable, stunting and leaf distortion are severe.
• Internal browning of the fruit sometimes occurs and this symptom
is most common when fruits become infected at the mature
green or pink stage.
• Field sanitation will reduce the amount of inoculum available for infection the following year.
• Deep-plough to bury tomato debris, or dead plants should be removed from the
garden and destroyed.
• Clean seed and healthy transplants will help control the disease.
• Use resistant varieties. e.g. Summerset F1, Zest F1.
• Practice crop rotation with non-Solanaceae plants to break the pest cycle for at least
one and half years and remove volunteer plants.
• Avoid planting adjacent to earlier planted or old crops of brinjals (eggplants), pepper,
potatoes orolder tomato crops as they could be a source of disease.
• Use of plant essential oils e.g. NoPath for preventive and curative management.
• Field sanitation to reduce the source of primary inoculum from adjacent tomato
fields
or plants.
• Avoid planting tomatoes after potatoes or other Solanaceae plants.
• Use clean planting material.
• Use tomato transplants from a disease-free nursery.
• Scout fields regularly to look for late blight.
• Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough
apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.
• Use of compatible chemicals.
• Use resistant varieties and certified disease-free seeds.
• Remove crop debris and roots from the field.
• Field hygiene should be well practiced.
• Wash hands with soap and water before handling plants.
• Disinfect equipment.
• Use clean soil each year in seedbeds, or sterilize old soil.
• Do not plant in a field with infected debris.

Module 4: Identification of Tomato leaf miner
Objectives
•
Farmers understand different stages of development for the tomato leaf miner.
•
Farmers effectively differentiate tomato leaf miner from other similar pests.
•
Farmers understand modes of dispersal of the tomato leaf miner and the agents involved.
The pest arrived in Africa from southern Europe into North and West Africa then onward to the south. Since its
arrival on the African continent in 2008, the tomato leaf miner, remains the most important biotic constraint to
tomato production in North and sub-Saharan Africa.
In Kenya, the tomato leaf miner was first reported in 2014. A survey of tomato farmers in Kenya in 2018 showed
that about 98% of tomato growers experienced the pest on their farms, and about 40% of the farmers had lost
a big proportion of their crop to this pest. Seasonal production loss due to the tomato leaf miner was estimated
to be at least 114,000 tonnes, which translates to US$ 59.3 million (CABI evidence note).
Yield losses affect the farmer’s income directly
due to reduction in marketable yield and indirect­
ly through higher production costs, as a result of
increased investment in pest management. The
consumers too are affected by the increased price
of tomatoes occasioned by the higher production
cost incurred by the farmer.
Tomato leaf miner causes significant yield losses to farmers in Kenya
Tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta) is an invasive pest with its origin in South America.
The tomato leaf miner, is a major pest of field- and greenhouse-grown tomatoes. The pest
is oligophagous (feeds on a limited number of crops, of related genera or the members
of a single taxonomic family). The pest mainly feeds on crops/plants in the Solanaceae
family, but the main host is tomato. Such plants in the Solanaceae family include; potato,
egg plant, capsicums etc.
Identity
Scientific name: Tuta absoluta
Common name: Tomato leaf miner
Biology and life cycle
The tomato leaf miner has four stages in its life cycle (Figure 4.1).
•
Eggs stage

* Eggs are yellow in colour turnin g darker about a day before hatching

* The eggs are oval cylindrical, 0.4 mm in length and 0.2 mm in diameter

* Eggs are mostly (73%) laid on underside of Leaves-, buds, stems and calyx of unripe

fruits and hatching occurs within 4-7 days at 27°C.

•
They are both moths (Lepidopteran) belonging to the same family of
insects.
•
They attack crops belonging to the same family -Solanaceae.
•
Among a range of species within the Solanaceae, tomatoes appear to
be the primary host of the tomato leaf miner, while potato tuber moth
primarily attacks potatoes.
The tomato leaf miner may be confused with the Potato tuber moth
(Phthorimaea operculella).
•
Larva stage

* There are 4 larval stages (instars).

* Early stages are whitish or cream with a black head

* Later turn pink or green

* Fully grown larvae drop to the ground in a silken thread and pupate in soil
•
Pupa stage

* Pupae are brown, about 4.3 mm in length and 1.1 mm in width.

* Pupation takes place in soil or on plant parts such as dried leaves and stem.

* Pupation has also been reported on packaging/storage equipment/material.
•
Adult Stage

* Adult moths are small, grey-brown, thin. They have brown or silver colour with black

spots on the wings

* They are usually active at dusk and dawn and hide between leaves during the day

* Body length 4.5- 7mm, with a wingspan of 8-10 mm.

* The total live cycle is completed within 30-35 days depending on the environmental

conditions, producing about 10–12 generations per year.

Symptoms
•
Vegetative symptoms

• Thin silvery trails (tunnels) on leaves which may join together to form white blotches.

• Leaf mines are irregular and may later become ‘burned’ (necrotic-dead-dry).

• Green larvae with black heads, and their black frass, inside the tunnels.

• Tiny holes on stems.

• Silky webs produced by larvae appear to fold leaf.

• Leaves may fall off if badly attacked.
•
Fruit symptoms

• Holes in fruit, possibly surrounded by black frass.

• Larvae and galleries inside fruit.

• Sunscald of fruit due to leaves prematurely falling.
Fruits can be attacked by the tomato leaf miner as soon as they are formed,
and the galleries bored inside them can be invaded by secondary pathogens
leading to fruit rot.
Dispersal and spread
•
Short distance spread occurs as a result of natural means (flight) and/or being carried by air cur­
rents (winds) from one plant/farm to the next.
•
Different stages of the tomato leaf miner can also survive on tomato, eggplant fruits and packaging
material, including crates, boxes etc.
•
Infested transplants also form another pathway for entry and spread of the pest.
•
Agricultural trade of tomato fruits has been cited as the main pathway in which the tomato leaf miner
has been spread over long distances expanding its ranges.

Module 5: Management of Tomato leaf miner

Objectives
•
Understand the strategies to use to prevent the tomato leaf miner from spreading to new farms.
•
Understand how to monitor tomato leaf miner populations on the farm.
•
Understand alternative control options for the tomato leaf miner.
CABI undertook a study in June 2019 to assess farmers’ practices for management of the tomato leaf miner in
Kenya. Results showed that 96.5% of farmers applied chemical pesticides. Of these, an average of 51% applied
between one and five sprays/season and 27% applied between six and ten sprays/season to contain this pest.
A tomato farmer in Oloitoktok mentioned that some farmers are known to apply up to 12 sprays during the
3-month cropping cycle, a practice that usually follows a spraying program rather than a pest management
decision made through monitoring. He says; “The pest spreads very fast and if you don’t spray, you may not
harvest anything. So, we start spraying two weeks after transplanting whether there is Tuta or not”.
This practice is likely to lead to pesticide resistance, and this might explain one finding from the same CABI study
that showed that only 27% of farmers thought pesticide treatments to be successful. Further, some farmers
don’t observe pre-harvest intervals, thus toxic substances are likely to enter into the human food chain posing
long-term health risks to consumers and the environment. Alternative control measures for the tomato leaf miner
need to be made available and accessible to smallholder farmers to address safety concerns.
Management of tomato leaf miner in Kenya is dominated by pesticide sprays
despite safety concerns of pesticide use

26
This module covers the management options for the tomato leaf miner, with focus on the
use of non-chemical and biological control approaches. These approaches offer safer,
cost effective and environmentally friendly option to the smallholder farmer.
Prevention
•
Plant clean seedlings free from all stages of the moth.
•
Crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops such as maize, beans and cabbages, helps in breaking
the lifecycle of the tomato leaf miner.
•
Remove and destroy wild host plants such as Sodom apple around the farm.
•
Remove from the farm and burn all infected crop residues.
•
Clean all equipment used in transportation of tomatoes such as boxes, crates and trucks using
soap and water.
•
Inspect packaging equipment to ensure there are no eggs, larvae or pupae that might develop and
spread.
Scouting and Monitoring
•
Early scouting and/or monitoring is important in establishing early enough the presence of the pest,
threshold levels and for decision making.
•
Use pheromone traps for early detection.
•
Look out for ‘burnt’ leaves with irregular mines that have black deposits (frass).
•
Look out for black frass on the stem and exit holes on the fruit surface leading to tunnels in the fruit.
•
Scout for moths in the field/ greenhouse walls.
•
Start control once you notice 1-3 moths or larvae per week.
•
Use pheromone-based strategies to help in monitoring and early detection of the tomato leaf miner.
E.g. use of Pherodis with Delta trap from Koppert.
Cultural and physical control
•
Destroy infested plants and plant parts to limit the possibility of the pest at a particular life-stage from
developing to the next and thus controlling the pest population.
•
Bury (50-100 cm) all pest infested fruits and foliage.
•
Remove alternative reservoir hosts such as nightshades before and during the cropping cycle.
•
Crop rotation with non-host crops ensures a long-term reduction in pest pressure.
•
In greenhouses, keep infested greenhouses closed after harvest to prevent the migration of adult
tomato leaf miners to open-field crops.
Use of semio-chemicals
•
Pheromones traps can be used for mass trapping or mating disruption which helps in reduction of
pest population.
•
Mass trapping removes males from the field, while mating disruption confuses the males so that
they cannot find females to mate with, hence reducing the overall population over time. For example,
the use of Pherodis plus Tutasan water trap from Koppert.
The approaches should be embedded in the farming cycle starting early in the season with preventive meas­
ures, and field management once the pest is detected on the farm.
Koppert has produced many types of pheromone traps for different insects.

Note to the trainer

27
Use of microbial pesticides
•
These are pesticide formulations that consist of a beneficial microorganism (e.g. a bacterium, fun­
gus, virus or protozoan) as the active ingredient.
•
Different microbial pesticides have been tested and found effective against Tuta absoluta and are
commercially available. They include; Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Btk), Beauveria bassiana,
Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, and Metarhizium anisopliae.
Use of botanicals
•
These are plant extracts used in the management of pests and may be contact or systemic. Several
plants extracts have been used to control the tomato leaf miner. For instance, extract from neem
seeds (Azadirachta indica), have been used as contact insecticide against the tomato leaf miner
and other crop pests.
•
Many products containing Azadirachtin are available commercially in Kenya and include; Neemroc,
Nimbecidine, Neemark EC, Achook 0.15 EC, and Azadirachtin (0.15%).
Biological control
•
Natural enemies play a key role in checking the populations of pests. The most common predators
against the tomato leaf miner are the mirid bugs, Nesidiocoris tenuis and Macrolophus pygmaeus
(Mirical), minute pirate bug, Orius and parasitic wasps.
•
Ladybird beetles, parasitic wasps and predatory bugs have potential to check populations of the
tomato leaf miner.
•
Often the effectiveness of existing natural enemies in regulating pest numbers is affected by adverse
farming practices such as the use of broad-spectrum pesticides.
•
Farmers should be advised to conserve natural enemies either through establishment of insect zoos,
crop/hedge diversification, destruction of ant colonies, and judicious use of chemical pesticides.
This encourages natural pest regulation.
Koppert has quite a number of natural enemy products. Other suppliers are
Dudutech and Real IPM.
The module aims to emphasize the importance of alternative and non-chem­
ical measures for management of the tomato leaf miner. While chemical
pesticides are available, they should be used as a last resort and proper
handling should be adhered to. Some of the pesticides have been specified
in the pest management decision guide (PMDG). Trainers can refer to the
PMDG to answer questions related to pesticide use.

Module 6: Integrated Pest management (IPM) practices for the
tomato leaf miner
Objectives
•
Farmers know how to place/apply IPM principles and strategies in their tomato farms.
•
Farmers get to know how to select, treat seeds and prepare land for raising seedlings in nursery beds of
transplanting.
The CABI/Koppert project aimed to demonstrate biological approaches for sustainable management of
tomato leaf miner in Kenya, to reduce pesticides use and associated risks. Koppert offered farmers training on
biological crop protection through farmer field days, demonstrations and offered technical support through our
field support team. Ten open field demonstrations were done in Kajiado county, Kenya. Field data collection
showed significant low pest pressure on demonstration plots compared to farmer practice (Figure 6). Three
greenhouse demonstrations were set up in Juja, Rironi and Kikuyu to showcase biological control of pests. In
one site, the Tuta absoluta damage score was comparable in both the IPM greenhouse as well as the Farmer
Practice greenhouse. For the other two locations, the lower Tuta absoluta damage was recorded in the IPM
greenhouses compared with the standard Farmer Practice (FP) (Figure 6).

What is IPM?
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a system of pest management that incorporates
preventive cultural, mechanical, physical, biological and chemical controls in a compatible manner to keep pest
population below economically injurious levels.
The key objectives of IPM are economic viability, social acceptability and minimal risk to human health and the
environment.
IPM not only focuses on the existing pest but also on reducing pest invasion and pest emergence and keeping
the pest population low. A successful IPM program focuses on this implementation approach.
IPM emphasizes the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agroecosystems and encour­
ages natural pest control mechanisms (FAO and WHO, 2014). It involves a combination of all available control
measures and strategies: cultural, physical, biological and judicious use of registered pesticides.
Benefits of IPM
•
Encourages use of Interventions that reduce or minimize risks to human and animal health and/or the
environment.
•
Encourages use and conservation of natural pest control mechanisms.
•
Encourages surveillance, monitoring and early detection of both pests and natural enemies.
Koppert IPM regime for tomato leaf miner management
This approach is based on CABI/KOPPERT joint initiative to demonstrate biological options for man­
agement of the tomato leaf miner. Farmers can obtain active ingredients of the mentioned products or
adapt best practices from this regime.
The IPM package comprises integration of:

1. Good agricultural practices (see Module 2)

2. Management of soil borne diseases with Trianum-P (Topic 6.1)

3. Pest monitoring and mass trapping using Pherodis (Delta traps and Tutasan) (Topic 6.2)

4. Use of Mirical for biological control of tomato leaf miner (Topic 66.3)

5. Use of Horiver sticky traps (Topic 6.4)
These practices are discussed in detail in the respective topics/modules indicated in parentheses.
It is advisable for farmers to use these practices in combination for best
results. However, farmers may also choose what practices to use based on
their resources. The trainer can advise farmers before they invest.
Since the tomato leaf miner is a mobile pest, management of this pest should be done on an
area-wide or community scale. Area-wide integrated pest management approach is more
cost-effective and sustainable as it proactively targets the entire pest population. In this
way, pest populations can be contained at low levels for longer periods and pest manage­
ment methods can be integrated that are less reliant on synthetic pesticides and that better
address ecological and environmental concerns.
Farmers in the same locality can be advised to use the area-wide approach that may in­
clude;
•
Synchronised rotations.
•
Regular monitoring of the pest.
•
Timing of planting.

•
Conservation of natural enemies.
•
Removal of volunteer crops and other host plants from the environment to prevent re-invasion
into new fields.
•
Removal of the old crop with its remaining pests and disease organisms remote from the
growing area helps to reduce or delay infection in the new crop.
•
Removing infested plants or plant parts from the start of the new crop limits sources infection.
•
Cleaning the greenhouse structure with all that is in it, is also important.
•

•
Farmers understand handling and precautions when using Trianum-P.
Topic 6.1: Management of soil-borne pathogens using Trianum-P
Pathogens are parasitic; that is, they depend on a host to survive and reproduce. Soil-borne pathogens prefer to
live within the soil, causing root disease. These pathogens will not only harm a plant, but they can even affect
the soil itself.
This topic describes the use of Trianum-P in the management of soil-borne pathogens, how it works and how
farmers can apply it in their fields.
What is Trianum?
•
Is a fungal-based product supplied by Koppert in Kenya
•
It contains spores (seed) of a beneficial fungus known as Trichoderma harzianum (strain T-22.).
•
Trichoderma harzianum Rifai Strain T-22 is a naturally occurring fungus that is used to protect crops and
seeds from various fungi that cause plant diseases.
•
It reduces soil-borne diseases such as Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia spp., Fusarium spp. and Sclerotinia
spp on a variety of crops including tomato.
•
If applied correctly, it develops mycelia, which grow along the roots (rhizosphere) and protects them
against diseases.
How to use Trianum-P
Trianum works by strengthening plant growth while competing with the pathogens.
•
Competition for space - Trianum grows faster on the surface of the root than other soil-borne fungi.
Other fungi get no chance to establish themselves on the roots allowing the plant to estalish faster.
•
Competition for nutrients - Trianum takes away the source of nutrients that the pathogens need to feed on.
They therefore have no chance to develop.
•
Acts as parasite on the disease pathogen - Trianum grows around the mycelia of the patho­
gen. The cell walls break down and the pathogen dies.
•
Strengthening of the plant - Trianum improves the root system through the formation of more root
hairs, for better water and nutrients absorption leading to a stronger and more uniform crop and hence
better yields.
•
Induced resistance - Trianum strengthens the defense mechanism of the above ground plant parts
(ISR- Induced Systemic Resistance).
•
Facilitating the absorption of fixed and non-fixed nutrients - Trianum has the capacity to
make certain “fixed” nutrients available for the plant to absorb.
Soil-borne pathogens are very difficult to observe with the naked eye. They are very small
or microscopic in size and cannot be adequately examined without the aid of magnification
(greater than 10X).Soil-borne pathogens include fungi, bacteria and nematodes.
Methods of application of Trianum-P
Trianum-P can be applied via drench application, drip-irrigation, or use of a sprayer while sowing.

How to prepare Trianum-P for application
•
Add 1 volume of Trianum-P to 5 volumes of water in a container and mix thoroughly.
•
Add suspension to the required amount of water to obtain the final drench solution.
•
Agitate continuously to maintain an even distribution of spores (spores do not dissolve in water and have
the property to precipitate).
•
To increase spore attachment to the roots, avoid run-off and excess drainage during the first two days
after application of the product.
•
Trianum-P is not a systemic product and is therefore not taken up by the plant.
•
Trianum-P can be applied multiple times to maximize on efficacy.
•
Make sure you use every amount prepared. It cannot be used be used after
staying overnight.
•
Trianum-P is used in the cultivation of vegetables, fruits, herbs, bulbs, orna­
mentals, perennials, and turf.
•
Check the product label for which crops Trianum–P is registered for use in
your country.
•
Introduce the topic through a presentation to farmers.

Emphasize the importance of managing soil borne pathogens, as they can be as harmful
as above ground pests and diseases, They affect crop growth from below ground, and
affect nutrient intake by the plant. Tianum is obtainable from Koppert, but other products
for management of soil-borne pathogens may be available for farmers to use.

•
Learn how the Pherodis plus traps (Deltatraps and Tutasan) work to manage the tomato leaf miner.
•
Learn how to apply Pherodis plus traps in the farm.
Topic 6.2: Using Pherodis plus Traps (Deltatraps and Tutasan Water traps)
Application of Pherodis with delta trap
•
When applying, do not touch the dispenser, since manual contact can spread pheromones or interfere
with efficacy.
•
Open the packet, remove the capsule and place it on the adhesive plate of the Delta trap (figure A) and
hang the trap in a suitable position approximately 10 cm above the crop (Figure B).
•
Hang the traps as evenly distributed as possible. This also make it easy to inspect.
•
Remove the sticky trap once covered by flies and replace with a another one as necessary.
What is Pherodis?
The Pherodis are capsules that release a species-specific sex pheromone to lure adult
malesof the pest into the trap.
Pherodis is used in combination with Deltatrap for monitoring pests, or Tutasan water trap
for mass-trapping of insect pests.

Application of Pherodis with Tutasan

•
Place the pheromone (inside the green basket, fixing it to the upper central part of the trap.
•
Fill the trap with water until it starts to overflow.

35
•
Add a small amount of vegetable oil or soap as a wetting agent.
•
Place 20-25 traps per ha for effective management evenly distributed in the field
•
Assign each trap a serial number and write it as well as the type of pheromone it contains on the outside.
•
Wash your hands between assembling pheromone traps in case of different species of butterflies and moths.
•
During the first few days following the installation of a new pheromone capsule, tomato leaf miner moths
may be caught more often than usual.
•
Pheromone dispensers remain effective for 6 weeks. Replace the capsule in the trap after 6 weeks, but
only with a dispenser containing the same kind of pheromone.
•
Always check for the shelf life (expiry date) on package for storage.

Cold storage in a fridge is necessary while the product is in storage or transit
with Koppert or distributors.
Farmers should be encouraged to only buy enough product to use immediately (a couple
of hours or days at room temperature with the farmer before application should be ok).
Handling and Best conditions for Pherodis to work
•
Never open the “plastic tube” of pheromone dispenser- the pheromone will completely evaporate almost
immediately making it useless.
•
The plastic tube is permeable, and the pheromone will gradually diffuse through the wall.
•
Pheromone dispensers and the sachets containing them should be kept at temperatures below 4°C while
on transit from Koppert appointed distributor).
•
The production date is printed on the packaging.
•
The dispensers have a shelf life of 2 years after the production date when stored in a freezer, and 1 year
when stored in a refrigerator (4-6°C).
Advantages of using pheromones
•
Pheromones are completely harmless to humans and other beneficial insects
•
They can be used to detect pest infections early.
•
They are not toxic to food or the environment. No pre-harvest interval is needed.
•
They do not cause resistance in pests.
•
They optimize the use of the same trapping devices, reducing the cost.

Use Mirical for:
•
Greenhouse whitefly
•
Tobacco whitefly
•
Two spotted spider mites
•
Thrips
•
Eggs of butterflies and tomato leaf miner moth
•
Aphids
•
Leaf miner larvae
When to use Mirical-N?
•
As nymphs of Macrolophus are less mobile than adult Macrolophus, Mirical-N can be used for biological
pest control in hotspots.
•
Introduce Macrolophus at the beginning of the growing season, as the predatory bug population needs
time to establish and develop. After a few months, highly dependent on climatic conditions and availability
of food, density of Macrolophus should be high enough to control the pests.
How does Mirical work?
•
Adult predatory bugs and nymphs actively search for their prey and consume them. In case of whitefly
eggs, larvae or pupae only the skin is left behind in its original state.
Side effects
•
Pesticides can have (in)direct effects on biological solutions. Our side effects app tells you how harmful
different pesticides are.
Mirical (Macrolophus pygmaeus) is used for biological pest control of certain whiteflies
and the tomato leaf miner.
Its efficacy in green house tomato production has been tested and confirmed. Its use
in open field is still under trial, but preliminary results from the CABI/Koppert project
showed promising results.
Mirical contains living organisms (predatory bugs) that are introduced in the field to manage
tomato leaf miner. Farmers should employ practices that conserve the organism and help
its establishment. For example, farmers should minimise spraying synthetic pesticides. ≈

In case the crop is damaged and spraying can’t be avoided, use the pesticide judiciously and select compatible
pesticides (such as) Indoxacarb (AVAUNT 150 EC, Merit etc.), Flubendiamide (Belt), Chlorantraniliprole (Cor­
agen), Imidacloprid 175g/L + Novaluron 30g/L (GRIZLY), Azadirachtin (Nimbecidine), Emamectin benzoate
(Improve) among other registered products (Refer to PMDG).
Conservation practices also help the reproduction of other natural enemies for pests, helping to keep pests in
check, and survival of crop pollinators.

•
These sticky traps don’t control the tomato leaf miner but may be included as
part of the IPM strategy.
•
For the tomato leaf miner, use of Pherodis plus Deltatrap for monitoring and
Pherodis plus Tutasan Watertrap for mass trapping is recommended. This
applies for both greenhouse and open field settings where this has been re­
peatedly proven to work.
Topic objectives
•
Understand how to use sticky traps for pest monitoring and mass trapping.
•
How to make management decisions based on pest economic threshold levels.
When to use Horiver?
Horiver is used to monitor and trap the adult tomato leaf miner. It is also used for other pests such as
aphids, whiteflies, thrips and sciarids.
How does Horiver work?
Sticky traps are essential in the detection and partial elimination of many species of flying pests in
greenhouses. Sticky traps make it possible to detect pests at an early stage and then use biological
measures to combat them. This prevents unnecessary applications of chemicals.
Counting the captured insects on the sticky traps on a regular basis makes clear when pests are pres­
ent in the greenhouse, how fast their population is developing, and when their population is likely to
reach its peak. In this way growers are much better prepared for potential threats.
How to use Horiver
•
Tear a sticky trap from the pack.
•
Hang on a stick, wire of rope just above the crop to help with monitoring of the pest.
•
Check regularly and count the trapped insects.
•
In tall crops, position above the plant, and adjust the height (upwards) while it grows.
Instructions for usage of Horiver
•
With regards to tall crops such as cucumber, tomato and pepper, position the traps just above the top of
the plant and adjust while the plants grow.
•
When it comes to crops with a low canopy, support the traps by canes or wire holders and install them
maximum 30 cm above the crop.
•
The traps must be placed in areas where the risk of pest infestation is high, e.g. at doors, gable ends and
lateral ventilation openings.
•
Traps must be removed when significant numbers of flying parasites are caught. This happens when traps
hang among the plants (instead of above).
Dosage
•
With regards to monitoring purposes, the advised rate is five traps per 1,000 m². If the traps must contrib­
ute to the biological control of pests in so-called hot spots (i.e. mass trapping), use at least one trap per
•
20 m² or at most one trap per 2 m². Both small and larger traps can be used for this purpose.
Mass trapping techniques like use of Yellow and Blue Horiver cards contributes to control
of the flying stages of pests like whitefly and thrips and monitoring of adult tomato leaf
miner.

Background
Biology, field identification and dispersal.
Adult tomato leaf miner is small, silvery-brown moths, about 4.5- 7mm in length with a wingspan of 8-10 mm.
They are nocturnal, being most active at dusk and dawn, and rest on leaves and other plant parts during the
day. Female moths lay about 260 eggs, mostly singly or in small batches, on the underside of leaves, stems
and young fruit. The eggs are yellow, turning darker about a day before hatching. Hatching occurs in 4-7 days at
27°C. The total live cycle is completed within 30-35 days depending on the environmental conditions, producing
about 10–12 generations per year.
FACT SHEET FOR FARMERS
Tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta) Kenya
Recognise the problem
The tomato leaf miner, Tuta absoluta, is a native of South America (Peru), now present in several countries in
Africa, Asia and Europe. It has gained pest status and is the most important and devastating pest of tomato
wherever it has invaded. Tuta absoluta’s primary host is tomato, though it can feed and develop on other
members of the tomato family (Solanaceae) with potato, eggplant capsicums etc. being some of the crops of
economic importance that are attacked by this pest.
Damage is caused by the feeding activity of the larval stage of this insect resulting in irregular mines on the leaf
and fruit surfaces. Subsequently, damaged leaves shrivel, and may fall off decreasing the photosynthetic ca­
pacity of the plant and potentially decreasing the plant’s ability to defend itself from other biotic stresses. Under
heavy infestation, leaves acquire a burnt appearance. The galleries and mines in the leaves alter the general de­
velopment of the plant and can cause necrosis. They also provide suitable entry routes for secondary infection
by pathogens, further increasing the damage and cost of control, and lowering the market value of the fruits.
Damage on the growing tips of the plant results in their death halting the development of the plant, negatively
affecting the yield of the crop. Yield losses of up to 50–100% have been reported as a result of the direct and
indirect damage of Tuta absoluta. Other indirect damages result from overuse or misuse of synthetic pesti­
cides leading to the increase in chemical residues on the fruit and impacting negatively on the market (local
and international), human and environmental health, beneficial organisms e.g. pollinators, natural enemies etc.
and increase in the production costs of tomato resulting from the purchase and application of the pesticides.
Consumers are also affected by the increased price of commodities due to the higher production cost incurred
by the farmer.

41
Infestation in the field will be easily noticed by the mines in leaves, stems, puncture marks, abnormal shape, exit
holes and/or rot due to secondary infection, and frass (fine powdery material that plant-eating insects pass as
waste after they digest plant parts) and webbing on stems and fruit.
Short distance spread occurs as a result of natural means (flight) and/or being carried by air currents (winds)
from one plant/farm to the next. Infested transplants also form another pathway for entry and spread of Tuta
absoluta. Agricultural trade of tomato fruits is the main pathway in which Tuta absoluta has been spread over
long distances expanding its ranges.
Management.
1.
Early scouting and/or monitoring are important in establishing early enough the presence of the pest, thresh­
old levels and for decision making. Use pheromone traps for early detection, mass trapping and/or mating
disruption.
2.
Plant clean seedlings free from all stages of the moth.
3.
Practice orchard hygiene by removing from the farm and burn all infected crop residues and destroying wild
host plants such as Sodom apple and nightshades around the farm; Bury (50-100 cm) all pest infested
fruits and foliage.
4.
Crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops such as maize, beans and cabbages, helps in breaking the life­
cycle of the tomato leaf miner.
5.
Clean all equipment used in transportation of tomatoes such as boxes, crates and trucks using soap and water;
Inspect packaging equipment to ensure there are no eggs, larvae or pupae that might develop and spread.
6.
Conserve natural enemies like ladybirds, mirid bugs, minute pirate bug etc.– establishment of insect zoos,
crop/hedge diversification, destruction of ant colonies, and judicious use of chemical pesticides. Macrol­
ophus pygmaeus is a predatory mirid, commercalised as MIRICAL by Koppert, that feeds on immature
stages of tomato leaf miner.
7.
Use low-risk control options like biopesticides e.g. botanicals like Neem-based products (Azadirachtin),
Microbials pesticides e.g. products containing Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Btk), Beauveria bassiana,
Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, and Metarhizium anisopliae (e.g. Met69 supplied by Real IPM).
8.
Judiciously use chemical products containing Emamectin benzoate, Abamectin, Flubendiamide, Chloran­
traniliprole, Spinetoram against Tuta absoluta. Some of the chemical products registered in Kenya are:
Escort, Alonze, Belt, Coragen, Radiant respectively
1.
Use personal protective clothing, every time you use pesticides.
2.
Follow the instructions contained in the packet or bottle of insect pests, regarding rate, Pre-harvest
interval PHI, re-entry period, storage etc.
3.
Include adjuvants (stickers or spreaders or wetter) to improve the performance of chemical.
4.
Rotate chemical compounds (active ingredients) to limit development of pesticide resistance.
5.
Only apply chemical pesticides if the wind direction favours on-target deposition. Do not apply
when the wind velocity exceeds 15 mph.
Note:
For chemical use,
Area-wide management
For effective results, implement an integrated approach on an area-wide scale against this pest by combining
cultural, biological, physical and (only as a last resort) synthetic pesticides.

PEST MANAGEMENT DECISION GUIDE
Tuta absoluta (tomato leaf miner) on Tomato
Disease
Prevention
Monitoring
Mass trap using light traps or pheromone traps. This should be done before
transplanting and during the cropping cycle. This can be done on a community
level (areawide pest management) due to the mobile nature of tomato leaf miner.
Spray with neem-based or biopesticides when 1- 5 larvae are observed from
weekly monitoring. Some of the products include Nimbecidine, Bacillus thurin­
gensis (Bt)
Use biocontrol agents (natural enemies) e.g. the predatory mirids, Macrolophus
pygmaeus, commercialised in Kenya as MIRACAL by KOPPERT.
Spray chemical pesticides as last resort “rescue operation”.
Use personal protective clothing, every time you use pesticides or
pesticides in the field.
Follow the instructions contained in the packet or bottle of insect
pests, regarding rate, PHI, re-entry period, storage etc.
Include adjuvants (stickers or spreaders or wetter) to improve the
performance of chemical.
Rotate chemical compounds (active ingredients) to limit development
of pesticide resistance.
Only apply chemical pesticides if the wind direction favours on-target
deposition. Do not apply when the wind velocity exceeds 15 mph.
Regularly (weekly), randomly select
five points in the field (in a W- or
Z- pattern), and observe plants in
those selected spots. Always start
from a different point ensuring the
entire farm is covered. Observe the
following:
Use pheromone traps/lures to
monitor population density. If popu­
lations are high, as indicated by high
number on traps, manage the pest
starting with cultural and mechanical
practices.
Irregular mines on leaves,
young stems and branches
some resulting in burnt ap­
pearance.
White or cream exit holes and
rots/decay on fruits as a result
of secondary infection from the
wounds created by the mining
on fruits.
Frass (fine powdery material
that plant-eating insects pass
as waste after they digest plant
parts) and webbing on stems
and fruit.
Blue-green caterpillars with
characteristic black heads in
the holes.
Use clean planting materials (seedlings). Check for infested
transplants and destroy them properly. Disinfect the rest
before planting to kill young larvae that may have been
missed.
Clean all materials used for the transportation of tomatoes
such as boxes, separators and even trucks using soap
and water.
Ensure proper post-harvest handling of fruits:  Sort har­
vested fruits by removing infested and punctured fruits.
Dispose any infested fruits properly by burning or burying
deep. Clean harvested pro-  	 duce with water before
marketing.
Observe field hygiene: e.g. cultural and mechacal control
of weeds / alternate host plants like nightshades etc. from
the field. Remove all affected plant and plant residues and
properly dispose them by burning or burying them deep.
This will help in reducing the chances of tomato leafminer­
from overwintering and spreading within the farms.
Practice crop rotation with non- solanaceous crops e.g.
maize, cabbage, beans etc. to break the cycle of the pest
and limit the damage within the farm.
Apply manures or fertilizer to enhance and maintain high
soil fertility. This will make your crops grow well and make
them withstand pest infestation. Also, plough deep and
leave the farm for some time before planting the new crop
to burry and/or expose any pupa present in the soil to solar
or predators. Use of plastic mulch has also been effective
in reducing pupation in the soil.
Insect isolation or exclusion- use nets to keep off tomato
leafminer and other pests especially in the nursery. For
greenhouse farmers, install double door system.
Mass trap using pheromone traps/lures or light traps be­
fore transplanting.
