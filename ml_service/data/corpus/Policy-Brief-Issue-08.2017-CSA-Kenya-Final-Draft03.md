POLICY BRIEF
08/2017

Introduction
The effects of climate change on agriculture are severe, and one
of the most significant emerging challenges to household
livelihoods in Africa. As such, it is imperative that efforts to
address agriculture in the context of food security and rural
development need to take climate change into consideration.
Climate-smart Agriculture (CSA) is defined as agricultural practices
that sustainably increase productivity and system resilience, while
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is not a single specific
agricultural technology or practice that can be universally applied;
it is a combination of policy, technology, and finance options that
involves the direct incorporation of climate change adaptation and
mitigation
into
agricultural
development
planning
and
implementation (FAO, 2010). Kenya holds great potential for CSA,
but this needs to be further explored. Although the country has
traditional agricultural practices as well as research-based
programs and techniques that have CSA qualities, CSA promotion
requires concerted action from multiple actors to allow for
context-specific approaches to be designed, implemented.

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
ONE: The diversity of Kenya’s agro-ecological zones lends itself to
decentralized approaches to CSA. County-level approaches should
be employed to maximize success in implementing CSA in Kenya.
TWO: Farmers need to be engaged in designing and implementing
CSA practices, and should receive immediate and long-term
benefits from implementing these approaches.
THREE:  CSA practices are knowledge-intensive, and promoting
their adoption requires well-designed, inclusive, and innovative
knowledge-management systems. Efforts must be made to fully
engage Kenya’s robust research and extension stakeholders in
promoting the uptake of CSA.
FOUR: Scaling-up promising CSA requires institutional coordination
between private and public agriculture and climate-related
institutions at national, regional, and international levels. Efforts
must be made to ensure that the implementation of the National
CSA strategy complements the implementation of other national
climate change initiatives.

POPULATION Total population of 48.46 million (World Bank, 2016) of which 74% live in rural areas (UN,
2017).
ECONOMY Real GDP growth increased to an estimated 6% in 2016, from 5.6% in 2015, with slight
increases projected for 2017 and 2018.  A stable macroeconomic environment with single-digit inflation
(averaging 6.3% in 2016) (African Economic Outlook, 2017).
POVERTY Approximately 50% of population below the international poverty line (World Bank, 2017a).
AGRICULTURE IN ECONOMY Agriculture contributes 24% to GDP (UNICEF, 2010). Almost 90% of the
total rural labor force is directly or indirectly involved in agriculture (Statistics Kenya, 2014).
FOOD SECURITY INDEX High ratings on relative to African countries; within top 50% of countries globally (Food Security Index, 2015).
CLIMATE CHANGE Kenya’s greenhouse gas emissions contribute 0.13% of global emissions (USAID, 2015). Agriculture contributes 24% of the nation’s
greenhouse emissions (World Bank, 2017c).
CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURE IN KENYA

Promoting a Conducive Policy Environment for a Food and Nutrition Secure Africa

2 | P a g e

Context Overview
AGRICULTURE IN KENYA
Productive agricultural land occupies less
than 20 percent of the country’s land area
and carries approximately 90 percent of
the country’s population (UNFPA, 2013).
Kenya’s agriculture sector consists of crops
and livestock production, with smallholder
farmers accounting for most of the
agricultural productivity.
Tea is Kenya’s leading export crop, and
other exports include coffee and fresh
produce. Cattle is the primary livestock in
Kenya.
Agriculture, which employs most of the
national
workforce,
suffers
from
low
productivity.  Yields are low, sometimes as
much as 70 percent below global best
practice (World Bank, 2009). Many farmers
lack access to improved varieties of seeds
and fertilizers, as well as to crop, soil, water,
and animal management practices that have
proved their worth in many African trials.
VULNERABILITIES
The
Fifth
Assessment
of
the
Intergovernmental
Panel
on
Climate
Change (IPCC) has shown that global
climate change is already damaging crops
and
undermining
food
production
capacity, particularly in poorer countries
(IPCC, 2014).
The vulnerability of African countries,
including Kenya, to climate change is
compounded by strong dependence on
rain-fed agriculture and natural resources;
high levels of poverty; low levels of human
capital; low levels of preparedness for
climate events; and poor infrastructure in
rural areas.
Temperatures in Sub-Saharan Africa are
already close to or beyond thresholds at
which further warming reduces (already
low) yields (Cline, 2008), and Kenya’s
Second National Communication to the
United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) projects that
mean annual temperature may increase by
between 0.8 and 1.5°C by the 2030s, and
1.6°C to 2.7°C by the 2060s. In the absence
of intervention, agricultural yields in will
continue to decline.
Kenya’s climate varies considerably across
the country. It is hot and humid at the
coast, temperate inland, and very dry (of
arid nature) in the north and northeast
parts. The western, central, and coastal
regions are primarily rain-fed. (UNFPA,
2013).
Kenya is prone to cyclical, prolonged
droughts and serious floods, with climate
change increasing the intensity and
frequency of these events. As a water-
scarce country, Kenya is critically exposed
to the adverse effects of climate change.
Being a developing country with a majority
of the population dependent on climate-
sensitive sectors, Kenya has low adaptive
capacity to withstand the adverse impacts
of climate change.
Countries in Southern Africa are also
affected by El Niño (warm) and La Niña
(cool) events in the tropical Pacific. The
most recent El Niño (2014-2016) and La
Niña (2016-2017) have impacted on
agriculture in East Africa, including Kenya
(Hirons and Klinagman, 2016). Although
the El Niño has receded, the impact of the
higher- than-average temperatures and
the lower-than-average rainfall continue
to be felt.
A comparative assessment of fifteen
African countries reveals that the onset
impacts of climate change are already
being perceived both by formal experts
and by rural populations across Eastern
and Southern Africa, including Kenya
(FANRPAN, 2017).
AGRICULTURE & DEVELOPMENT
Agriculture remains one of the most
effective pathways out of poverty. Gross
domestic
product
(GDP)
growth
that
originates in agriculture is approximately
four times more effective in reducing
poverty than GDP growth that originates in
other sectors (World Bank, 2008). The risk
which climate change poses to the sector
thus has significant implications for poverty-
reducing capacity.
In this context, CSA is critical for food
security and development. It is an approach
that can help reduce the negative impacts
of climate change and can increase the
adaptive capacity of farming communities
to long-term climatic trends (FAO, 2010).

Eastern and Southern African countries
generally have policies on agriculture and
climate change, and do recognize the
impacts of the latter on the former. Some
countries have developed National Climate
Change Policies, while others have National
Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA).
However, policies often lack adequate
instruments to achieve the goals they set.
Furthermore, they are not yet sufficiently
connected across sectors.
INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL
ENVIRONMENT
As a non-Annex I party to the UNFCCC
Paris
Agreement,
Kenya
has
an
obligation under the to report on the
anthropogenic sources and sinks of
greenhouse gases, and identify measures
to minimize the impacts of global
warming and climate change. Kenya
submitted and ratified its Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC) to the
convention in late 2016. The NDC states
Kenya’s target to reduce its GHG
emissions by 30% by 2030 relative to the
business as usual scenario.
Regionally, Kenya is implementing the
Comprehensive
Africa
Agriculture
Development
Programme
(CAADP)
Framework (2010). Kenya signed its
CAADP compact in 2010 and has a

medium-term investment plan for the
agricultural
sector
aligned
to
its
compact.
NATIONAL POLICY ENVIRONMENT
The Ministry of Environment, Natural
Resources, and Regional Development
Authorities (MENRRDA) is the national
climate change focal point in Kenya with
responsibility
to
ensure
the
full
implementation of the strategies and
measures for
curbing the adverse
impacts of climate change and variability
on all the sectors of the economy.
Kenya developed its first national level
policy document related to climate
change in 2010, namely the National
Climate
Change
Response
Strategy
(NCCRS). Since then, Kenya developed a
National Climate Change Action Plan,
2013-2017 (NCCAP) and a draft National
Adaptation Plan (NAP).
The NCCAP identifies priority mitigation
and adaptation measures and provides
information on how to integrate these
options in national development plans; it
is the primary mechanism through which
the NCCRS is operationalized.
Specifically, the Plan recognizes the
critical importance of CSA practices such
as agroforestry, conservation tillage, the

limited use of fire in agricultural areas,
cultivation of drought-tolerant crops,
water harvesting, and integrated soil
fertility management, among others.
The draft NAP identifies CSA as a priority
area, and recommends the development
of
an
adaptation
Monitoring
and
Evaluation (M&E) system. This system
will help to ensure that the benefits of
interventions aimed at building adaptive
capacities and enhancing resilience are
being realized.
However, until very recently, national
strategies and interventions such as the
National Climate Change Action Plan
(2013-2017) and the Agriculture Sector
Development Strategy (2010-2020) did
not adequately mainstream adaptation,
building resilience, and mitigation of
GHGs into the agricultural sector. In
2012
the
Kenyan
Climate
Change
Authority Bill was gazette and is in the
process of being enacted to mainstream
climate change within national policy.
The Bill proposes formation of the
Climate Change Authority to coordinate
activities across government sectors and
non-state
actors
and
guide
the
implementation of the NCCRS, including
a M&E function and ensuring Kenya’s
compliance with national conventions.

The Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Strategy (KCSAS) was launched in 2017 and has been developed to guide
investments and implementation of CSA activities guaranteeing productivity and food security, while addressing
climate change adaptation and mitigation

CSA POLICIES AND STRATEGY
The Agriculture Sector Development
Strategy (ASDS 2010- 2020) is the overall
and current national policy document for
the agricultural sector, and identifies
climate adaptation as a priority.
The Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture
Strategy (KCSAS) was launched in 2017
and has been developed to guide
investments and implementation of CSA
activities guaranteeing productivity and
food security, while addressing climate
change adaptation and mitigation.
The strategy was jointly developed by
the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock,
and Fisheries (MoALF), the Ministry of
Environment and Natural Resources
(MENR), and other government entities,
with support from the World Bank, the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP).
The overall objective of the strategy is to
build resilience and minimize emissions
from agricultural farming systems for
enhanced food and nutritional security
and improved livelihoods.
The
coordination
framework
and
implementation mechanism for the
strategy will be harmonized within an
inter-governmental
coordination
structure which is under development
and will be mainly implemented by the
county governments.
The KCSAS is a tool to implement Kenya’s
NDC contribution for the agriculture
sector to the UNFCCC.

Kenya has examples of both traditional
and research-based agricultural practices
that can be deemed climate-smart, but
they are not mainstreamed and still
receive limited support – particularly
among smallholder farmers. The Kenya
Climate-Smart
Agriculture
Strategy
launched in 2017 offers great potential to
overcome
these
hurdles.
There
is
significant scope to increase collaboration
between
government,
farmers,
and
private-sector stakeholders to promote
CSA in Kenya.
Although CSA practices are used in
many of Kenya’s agro-ecological zones,
few have high adoption rates. Low and
medium adoption rates for practices
scoring high on climate-smartness, are
linked with infrastructural, institutional,
and financial challenges for both farmers
and other stakeholders in the agriculture
value chain.
There
are
several
research
and
development projects in the country
that are implemented by different
stakeholders, both governmental and
nongovernmental; however, there is
very little coordination between them. In
this
sense,
the
operational
KCSAS
provides
a
good
opportunity
for
coordinating
interventions
in
the
country.
Examples of projects and practices in
Kenya are provided below.
Mitigation of Climate Change in
Agriculture (MICCA)
The Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), with financial support from the
Government of Finland, designed the
Mitigation
of
Climate
Change
in
Agriculture
(MICCA)
Programme
to
expand the climate change evidence
base and build CSA readiness.
The MICCA CSA pilot projects (2011–
2014), implemented jointly with partners
in Kenya, promoted integrated and
diversified farming systems and agro-
ecological principles. The pilot projects
linked research activities, practical work
in farmers' fields, and policy making at
different
levels
to
enhance
the
effectiveness
of
planning
and
programming for CSA on farms. The
project pilot evaluations illustrated that
CSA can be an effective approach for

improving
food
security,
alleviating
poverty, and building more resilient
livelihoods.
It
also
indicates
that
smallholder farmers can be an effective
part of the response to climate change
and make a meaningful contribution to
reducing GHG emissions (FAO, 2016).
National Accelerated Agricultural
Input Access Programme (NAAIAP)
This program is promoting the use of
fertilizers and quality seed among food
deficit farmers. Each farmer receives
50kg of planting fertilizer, 50kg top
dressing fertilizer, and 10kg hybrid seed.
They are expected to obtain high yields
and therefore require less land for crop
production. Other farmers under the
same program receive improved planting
cassava and sweet potato cuttings.
These are clear CSA projects aimed at
improving food security.
Index-based livestock insurance
This project is being implemented in
collaboration with commercial partners

which include Equity Bank of Kenya, UAP
Insurance and Swiss-Re.  The project
provides livestock insurance to over
2000 households in Marsabit Sub-County
to help livestock herders sustain their
livestock-dependent livelihoods during
drought. The project was initiated by the
International
Livestock
Research
Institute (ILRI) in collaboration with
partners from Cornell University, the
BASIS
Research
Program
at
the
University of Wisconsin-Madison, and
Syracuse University.
The program uses satellite imagery to
determine and predict potential losses of
livestock forage, and issues insurance
payouts to participating members when
incidences of drought occur. The impact
of this pilot project is currently under
assessment to find out its benefits
before it can be scaled up to other sub-
counties in the country.
Strengthening capacity for CC
Adaptation in Land and Water
Management Project
Implemented by KARI and covering
approximately 12,000 households, the
project is funded by SIDA and the Kenyan
government.  The project objective is to
reduce the impact of climate change and
variability on smallholder agriculture
through sustainable land and water
management
technologies,
and
to
contribute to improvement of food
security and ecosystem resilience in the
selected watersheds and sub-counties of
Kenya.
The
project
promotes
livelihood-
strategic practices that will enhance
carbon storage, ecosystem resilience,
and sustainable livelihood options. These
include; crop diversification, adoption of
drought-tolerant
crop
varieties,
traditional high-value crops, minimum
tillage,
and
water
harvesting
and
conservation, among others.
STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES
CSA is context- and location-specific,
and
should
be
conceived
and
implemented with context-specificity in
mind to be effective.
Kenya is not a homogenous region, and
single, one-size-fits-all interventions
will not achieve impact. Agro-ecological
zones form a complex patchwork of
high- and low-potential areas. In almost
any given year, some areas in much of
the country are food secure and
generate food surpluses for sale, while
other areas suffer moderate to severe
shortages. Year-to-year fluctuations in
rainfall over short distances mean that
these patterns are highly variable in
time and location. This high variability
between counties thus lends itself to
decentralized strategies for CSA.
RECOMMENDATION County-level
approaches should be employed to
maximize success in implementing
CSA in Kenya’s diverse agro-ecological
zones.
Current
agricultural
and
related
sectoral policy objectives resonate with
a CSA framework to address food
security in a sustainable manner that
results in adaption to and mitigation of
climate
change.
Encouragingly,
governments and policy makers in
Kenya have adopted a multi-sectoral
approach in drafting the national CSA
strategy, and thus the Kenya Climate-
Smart Agriculture Strategy launched in
2017
offers
great
potential
to
overcome
challenges
arising
from
scattered policy priorities and project
disconnects.
RECOMMENDATION:  Scaling up
promising CSA practices and
innovations requires institutional
coordination between private and
public agriculture and climate-
related institutions at national,
regional, and international levels.
Efforts must be made to ensure that
the implementation of the National
CSA strategy complements the
implementation of other national
climate change initiatives.
Farmers need to be engaged in the
planning of CSA, and work jointly with
technical
specialists
and
extension
workers to identify CSA practices that
are suitable to local conditions.
RECOMMENDATION To ensure
sustainable and long-term adoption
of CSA practices, farmers need to
receive immediate and long-term
benefits from in terms of improved
food security, food production, and
income. Governments and policy
makers should promote financial
incentives that encourage CSA.
KNOWLEDGE SHARING, CAPACITY
BUILDING, AND EXTENSION
There are several development and
research programs pertinent to CSA in
Kenya, which are contributing to the
knowledge base around high-potential
approaches.
However,
since
CSA
practices
are
knowledge-intensive,
promoting their adoption will require
well-designed, inclusive, and innovative
knowledge-management systems that
facilitate information-sharing techniques

for and among farmers, and support
local and indigenous knowledge.
RECOMMENDATION Efforts must
be made to fully engage Kenya’s
robust research and extension
system in promoting the design and
uptake of CSA practices and
innovations.
Continued research is necessary to
develop
appropriate
low-cost
technologies
to
address
the
requirements
of
Kenyan
farmers,
coupled
with
continued
capacity
building among these target groups.
Specifically, considerable policy support
and capacity enhancement is needed for
climate-risk
management,
including
insurance and safety nets as well as
improved access to weather information
adapted to farmers` needs.

INVESTMENT FLOW
The Government of Kenya is in the
process of creating a National Climate
Change Fund (NCCF) through its Climate
Change Bill that will support CSA. In
addition, the Kenyan Climate-Smart
Agriculture Programme is in place as an
operational document that provides a
good opportunity for coordinating CSA
interventions in Kenya.
To date, climate finance has failed to
adequately integrate agriculture, though
it has great potential for adaptation and
mitigation.
Improved
monitoring,
impact measurement, reporting, and
result demonstration will help ensure
continuous funding for climate-smart
agriculture.

RECOMMENDATION: Closely monitor
the impact and success of CSA projects
in the various agro-ecological zones in
Kenya to understand the potential of
initiatives to contribute to agricultural
transformation and livelihoods, and
attract increased investment.

Mapping CSA Policy and Practice in Africa
This policy brief is an output emanating from a larger study conducted in collaboration between the Food, Agriculture and Natural
Resources Policy Analysis Network (FANRPAN) and the Earth System Governance Project, on policies for climate-smart agriculture.
The Earth System Governance Project is an international social science research network in the area of governance and global
environmental change. The study was funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) and the African
Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF).
The research project consisted of a comparative assessment of relevant CSA policies and practices in 15 countries across Eastern and
Southern Africa. The research was commissioned by FANRPAN to analyze the barriers and opportunities for promoting CSA in sub-
Saharan Africa. This means agriculture that (i) increases productivity and income, (ii) adapts and builds resilience to climate change, and
(iii) reduces greenhouse gas emissions where
needed.
FANRPAN commissioned CSA Policy scoping
studies through the work of national
consultants and assessed the responsiveness of
policy frameworks in 15 Eastern and Southern
African countries (Botswana, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Kenya, Lesotho,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe).
The main objectives were to:
 Conduct a comprehensive review of
the existing CSA policies at national
level,
 Analyze gaps in the existing policy
frameworks,
 Assess the CSA technologies,
innovations and practice (as well as
untapped opportunities),
 Identify key stakeholders in CSA,
 Identify relevant policy
recommendations, and
 Develop and share policy
recommendations at national and
regional levels.

The study processes included review of existing documents and interviews with key informants from a wide range of organizations. In all
countries, national policy dialogues were convened to a) share the draft CSA scoping study report outputs with stakeholders; b) validate
the outputs from the draft CSA scoping study report; and c) solicit policy recommendations from stakeholders. The draft reports were
reviewed externally, and both recommendations from the national dialogues and external reviewers were incorporated into the CSA
scoping study’s final reports.
