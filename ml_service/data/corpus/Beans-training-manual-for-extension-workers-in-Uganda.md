A
griculture is as one of the key drivers of Uganda’s economy where over 70% of the population derives their livelihood.
The Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries has put in place interventions to boost production and
productivity of key priority and strategic commodities in medium term. Beans is one of the commodities prioritized
under ASSP (2015/16-2019/20). They are mainly grown by smallholder farmers who are the majority in Uganda. It is
therefore envisaged that promoting this enterprise will result in improving the living conditions of smallholder farmers.
The beans production system is predominantly small-scale accounting between 60–90% (on less than 2 acres) with
average production of 0.25 tons (250kg) per acre. This is very low compared to potential yield of 700 to 1500kg/acre
depending on the variety. The system is characterised by low input use especially seed and pesticides with most of the
producers using seed from previous harvest.
Beans offer the cheapest and most reliable source of protein and micronutrients mostly B vitamins, iron, calcium and
zinc. The crop offers a good source of balance nutrition for rural households especially the poor who can barely afford
animal protein. Furthermore, beans are important source of income especially for women and youth hence improving
their livelihoods and quality of life.
The manual aims at transforming the beans production sub-sector from predominantly subsistence, low input and low
productivity to fully commercialized where beans are grown as a Business. This will consequently improve household
incomes, food and nutrition security of rural households/farmers in Uganda.
First, the manual will be used by extension workers to provide appropriate training and advisory services to farmers.
Secondly, it will also be used by other actors along the bean value-chain for improving beans sub-sector.
I wish to thank everyone who contributed to the development of this document, particularly; stakeholders that provided
input into the drafting and validation of this document; members of the development team for reviewing the document
and steering the whole process, Feed the Future Uganda Enabling Environment for Agriculture Activity for facilitating the
process and Sasakawa Global 2000 for its technical expertise in the development of the document.
It is my hope that this manual will be resourceful and used adequately by extension workers and other value chain actors
to strengthen the beans sub-sector in Uganda.
Yours faithfully

Importance of Beans:
Common bean, scientifically known as Phaseolus vulgaris L. is an important legume staple crop in Uganda. National
annual consumption of beans is estimated at about 58 kg per capita. In 2016, the area planted under beans was
683,120 Ha with a total production of 1,104,770MT. Volume of beans exported increased from 157,152 MT (2015)
to 200,000MT (2017). Beans production system is predominantly small-scale accounting between 60–90% (on
less than 2 acres) with average production of 0.25 tons (250kg) per acre despite potential yield of 700 to1500kg/
acre depending on the variety. The system is characterised by low input use especially seed and pesticides with
most of the producers using seed from previous harvest.
Beans are important source of protein and micronutrients mostly B vitamins, iron, calcium and zinc. The crop
offers a good source of balance nutrition for rural households especially the poor who can barely afford animal
protein. Beans can be consumed as immature pods, mature fresh grain or dry beans and its leaves are used to
complement carbohydrate diets. In addition, dry beans are important source of income especially for women and
youth.
Besides, beans is able to fix nitrogen into the soil through its root nodules. This enhances soil fertility and further
reduces the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used in bean cultivation and other crops majorly intercropped with
beans. When intercropped, it plays many other functions including reducing pests and disease prevalence, weed
control as well as controlling soil erosion. It is therefore an important food and nutrition security crop that can
be used to enhance the economy of Uganda as well as a means of practicing sustainable climate smart agriculture.
Ecological Requirements
Beans thrives best in a warm climate of optimum growing temperature range of 20 to 28oC with a minimum of
15oC and a maximum of 32oC. Temperatures above 32oC and below 15oC will cause poor pod set resulting in
yield loss. Bean production is more successful in areas where rainfall is moderate to light during the latter part of
growing season.  Beans are adapted to a wide range of soils as long as the soils are reasonably fertile, well drained
and free of conditions such as saline. An optimum soil pH of 5.8 to 6.5 is ideal for beans production.
Challenges and Opportunities
The bean sector experiences a number of problems at different nodes of the value chain namely; input, production,
trading, processing and consumption levels. Major challenges include poor agronomic practices, declining soil
infertility, lack of seed from improved cultivars, poor   selection of bean seeds (seed mixtures), moisture stress,
weed competition, pests and diseases, high post-harvest losses; unstable prices; limited postharvest handling
technologies and lack of storage capacity.
On the other hand, a number of opportunities exist in beans industry including; increasing demand of beans
at domestic, regional and international levels; established research institution/ infrastructure to promote bean
production in Uganda; availability of a wide range improved bean varieties that are suitable to the different agro
ecologies; and possibility of value addition.
Module One:
Introduction and Background

2
Key value chain actors
There are several actors in the beans value chain in Uganda. They include; input suppliers, producers: seed
multipliers, aggregators/assemblers/ agents, wholesalers, retailers and consumers. Beyond the major actors, the
value chain also has enablers such as researchers like NARO and Makerere University; extension workers and a
number of NGOs, Financial Support Institutions, and policy makers such as MAAIF, MTIC and Uganda National
Bureau of Standards (NBS), among others.

This module covers recommended pre-planting and planting activities for bean production. Beans have a
short maturity period of 58 to 120 days from planting time. Beans need proper attention and suitable growing
conditions in order to maximize yields. To attain this, there is need to apply Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs).
GAPs are a set of practices for crop cultivation and farm management that help farmers to best use resources
to achieve high yields while minimizing costs of production. GAPs are the foundation for better yields and a
profitable bean production venture.
GAPs should be observed at all stages of bean production right from site selection, land preparation, seedbed
preparation, seed selection, planting, weed management, soil fertility management, harvesting, postharvest
handling and storage
Module Two:
Pre-planting and Planting Activities
2.1:   Planning at household level
2.2:   Site Selection
At household level, there is need for family members to agree on the variety of beans, the purpose, acreage and
when to plant. This brings in sense of ownership and togetherness for sustainable management. Women tend to
grow beans for food while men grow beans for cash.
Beans production requires a suitable site that will support optimal bean growth through the life cycle of the
crop. To achieve high bean yields, selection of highly productive land is crucial.
The recommended site for beans planting should have the following;
a)	Deep fertile well drained and aerated, sandy
loams or loamy soils
b)	An optimum soil pH of 5.8 to 6.5. Beans are
highly sensitive to acidic soils (pH < 5.2)
c)	Signs of soil fertility such as presence of
indicator plants eg elephant grass, Guinea
grass (Panicum maximum), Commelina sps
d)	For steeply sloping areas consider contour
hedgerows and terraces along the contour to
stabilize the soil and minimize the runoff.
During site selection avoid the following;
a.	Water logged areas because beans do not
tolerate water logged places.
b.	Very sandy soils
c.	Soils that are compacted (clay) and too
alkaline
Deep loam soils make a ball that breaks on slight pressure
Water logged soil is not ideal for bean production

2.3:   Soil testing
It is essential to assess soil health before any soil management operations are implemented. Constraints such as
soil acidity and soil nutrient deficiency can lead to significant reductions of crop yields. The soil pH and nutrients
levels can be determined by conventional soil analysis in addition to observation methods of crops growing in
the field.
Soil testing is an essential crop management decision-making tool that
enables one to:
i)	Determine acidity and alkalinity levels (soil pH);
ii) Identify any soil nutrient deficiencies;
iii)Estimate optimum fertilizer requirements for target yields;
iv)Estimate the optimum cost of fertilizer needed and the returns
In the field, a soil testing kit can be used or soil samples can be taken to
a recommended laboratory for further analysis.
Note:
ALWAYS get advice on how to test soils from extension workers
2.4:   Land Preparation
Land preparation involves; bush clearing, removal of tree stamps, termite mounds, and ploughing. Beans require
a fine seed bed for uniform and proper growth of roots to absorb the available soil nutrients. Well prepared
seedbed reduces on the number of weeding times.
2.4.1 Timing of land preparation
The timing of land preparation is extremely important. Land preparation should begin either at the end of the
harvesting period or at least 3 weeks (21 days) before planting to allow breakdown of organic matter. Land
should be ploughed at least twice in some cases followed with harrowing to obtain a fine seedbed. Where the
field has a known history of bean pests such as pod borers, bean fly and beetles, complement ploughing with
harrowing to kill the surviving eggs, pupae and adult pests.
If the site is very bushy, first clear land by slashing down all plant parts and leave them on the ground, or plough
in the plant residues using appropriate equipment. This will help soil to conserve moisture; improve the water-
retention capacity, water-infiltration capacity and increase soil fertility.
If the field was previously covered with weeds like Amaranthus spp, which produce a lot of seeds, then the land
needs to be prepared early in the season. This will encourage most of the weed seeds to germinate as soon
as the soil gets any moisture. The field can then be lightly tilled down or sprayed with non-selective herbicides
(glyphosates) before beans are planted; very shallow cultivation is needed, only along the topsoil, to remove the
germinating weeds.

DO NOT BURN PLANT RESIDUES :
as burning destroys plant nutrients from the residues and cannot easily
be replaced. Dig the plant residues into the soil to improve soil fertility,
aeration and water retention capacity
If ploughing is to be done using oxen or tractor, care must be taken to work the land when it is dry
2.4.2 Method of land preparation and related equipment
Seedbeds for beans production are mainly prepared using the conventional tillage procedures although some
farmers may use conservation tillage.

1. Conventional Methods:
In conventional tillage the farmer uses equipment like hand hoes, animal traction, and conventional walking
tractors to till land.
a)	The hand hoe is the most commonly used equipment by small holder farmers though it is slow and labour
intensive.
b)	Animal traction: this involves use oxen to plough land, although it is not suitable under heavy soils and
steep terrain. This method is the most appropriate, affordable, reliable and proven technology for small and
medium scale farmers;
c)	Conventional tractors open extensive land for commercial farming.
d)	Walking tractors (Power tillers) can be used by small and medium scale farmers.

2. Conservation Tillage (CT) :
Is also referred to as no-till/zero till, minimum /reduced till, and ridge (ripper) till. It is an agricultural management
approach that aims to minimize the frequency or intensity of tillage operations in an effort to promote certain
economic and environmental benefits. The principle of conservation tillage involves maintenance of at least 30%
surface soil cover through retention of crop residues. Retention of crop residue protects the soil from direct
impact of raindrops and sunlight while the minimal soil disturbance enhances soil biological activities as well as
soil air and water movement.
Under CT use of non-selective herbicides mainly Glyphosate is paramount.  Depending on the area to be tilled,
remove all tree stumps and other barriers like ant-hills. If the area is covered with thick thicket, first slash down
the bush, wait for the new germination of weeds and then spray them herbicides (Round-up, Weedmaster,
Mamba, Weedall).
CT allows timely planting at a reduced cost, improves soil structure, increases water infiltration and soil moisture
retention. In addition, it creates more soil organic matter, controls weeds, reduces soil erosion, reduce labour
and energy requirements.
Under CT, the farmer should adhere to the adequate planting depth since the seed needs more energy to
penetrate the sub-soil with its roots and the top soil with its shoot as compared to a ploughed field.
2.4.3 Application of manure
Compost or animal manure should be added at rate of 2 – 4tons per acre during the first cultivation to allow
for adequate decomposition and any weed seeds carried along to also germinate before the final tilling session
prior to planting.
Conservation tillage is suitable for all categories of farmers and higher
returns are realized if GAPs are followed
2.5:   Source of quality seed
High yield begins with good quality
seed, it is therefore important
to select well developed, mature,
uniform seed of sound vigour.
Farmers should always buy seed
from certified seed companies
or use Quality Declared Seed
usually produced by farmer groups
(Community Seed Multipliers).
2.5.1 Choice of suitable variety
There are many beans varieties grown in Uganda with varying traits for various locations (Annex 3).
Main types of common beans are;
•	 the bush bean type
•	 climbing beans –they are traditionally grown in high altitude (highlands) areas such as southern western and

mountainous areas of eastern Uganda although they are also becoming popular in low altitude. They require
support (stakes), they yield higher than the bush beans,
Selection of varieties to be grown will depend on the factors listed below;
a.	Market requirements. This varies depending on the buyer’s preferences. It includes factors like colour and
size of grain, nutritional value e.g. ROBA for High Iron, mode of utilization such as those for canning, pre-
cooking, fresh or dried beans.
b.	Adaptability and yield potential. Beans are produced under a wide
range of cropping systems and environment as well as regions as
diverse as high altitudes and low lands.  Climbing beans such as Nabe
12C, NAROBEAN 4C and 5C are grown in altitudes as high as
2,000 m above sea level as they are suitable for the cooler climatic
conditions while the bush types like Nabe4, Nabe 15, NAROBEAN
1, 2 and 3 are favoured by low altitude characterized by most of the
regions in the country. Some varieties such as ROBA1 are resistant
to drought and are, therefore, suitable for areas with low rainfall.
c.	Resistance to Pests and Diseases: A wide range of pests and diseases attack the beans at the different stages
of its growth cycle.  A farmer therefore should select a seed variety that can resist or tolerate both pest
and disease attack.  Several tolerant bean varieties have been developed by NARO (Annex 3).
d.	Length of Growing Season: The length of the growing season of varieties plays an important role, especially
when there is unpredictable variation in the amount and distribution of rainfall. Farmers should plant
varieties that have early maturity period and drought tolerant
2.5.2 Attributes of quality beans seed
•	 Uniformity
•	 High germination rate > 85%
•	 Well dried to 13% moisture Content
•	 Purity 98%: Ensure all seeds are of the same variety
•	 Clean: not mixed with foreign matter like stones or dirt, or other seeds
•	 Not damaged, broken, shrivelled, mouldy, or insect damaged
•	 Not rotten or discoloured faded
•	 All non-conformity should not exceed 2%.
A detailed criterion for determining seed quality is presented under Annex 4

2.5.3 Steps in conducting Germination Test
It is important to use seeds that will germinate and give healthy plants, therefore, seeds should be tested for
their ability to germinate.
1.A week before planting, take a sample, count off 100 seeds randomly.
2.	Put the seeds in a container with sand. The container should be pierced at the bottom to let water drain
3.	Keep the seeds moist, but not wet. Too much or too little water can prevent or delay seed germination
4.	After 7 days, carefully dig the seedlings up from the sand, put them on a paper and count seedlings in each
category below:
a.	 Normal seedlings: Well-developed roots, stems, leaves, & cotyledons.
b.	 Abnormal seedlings: Have any of the following signs: no main root, weak roots, no leaves, weak leaves,
no cotyledons, decayed cotyledons.
c.	 Rotten, diseased and unviable seeds which have not germinated.
Record your results as below
5.	If about 10 seeds (10%) have failed to germinate (90% germination) then use the recommended seed rate,
if germination is below 90% but above 85%, increase the seeds per acre at planting following calculation
below:

Recommended seed rate = 30 kg per acre

Percentage germination = 85%

Adjusted seed rate = (100÷85) x 30kg = 35.3kg
The new seed rate will be 35.3 kg per acre
If germination percentage is below 85% reject the seed.

Always report back to the stockiest, extension worker or the seed company
(supply) within 10 days after planting in case of germination failure.
Avoid late planting as this leads to increased pests and disease attack, and
reduced yields
2.6:   Planting
Planting should be done on the onset of rains. For long rain seasons, farmers
may delay planting by two to three weeks to avoid too much rainfall during
pod filling stage which may lead to rotting of pods and reduction in yields.
Early planting takes advantage of the nitrogen flush effect which is the
release of accumulated nitrogen in the soil during the dry season.
Normally, the first season is dominated by planting in March up to Mid-
April and harvesting in June-July; while the second season is from mid-
August to December, depending on the area and variety.  (Annex 7).

planting using a string to ensure that rows
are straight.

2.7:   Spacing and Seed rate (population density)
Plant in lines (rows) in order to achieve optimum plant population and also ease field operations such as
weeding, scouting for pests and diseases, spraying and harvesting.
To ensure line planting, mark out the field using marked strings or line markers following the recommended
spacing. For bush beans e.g Nabe 4, Nabe 15, use the spacing of 50cm x 10cm for sole crop with one seed per
hole, or a spacing of 50cm x20cm and two seeds per hole.
Spacing of bean plants depends on the soil fertility, plant type (growth habits), and cropping pattern. Optimum
plant population is critical because:
•	 High population leads to competition among the bean plants resulting into weak plants and ultimately low
yield. It also provides a favourable environment for growth and hide- out for most bean pests and diseases
•	 Lower plant population will result into low yields due to reduced number of plants per unit area.
The seed rate varies depending on the seed size but on average, the rate is between 25-30 kg of seed per acre
giving a plant population of approximately 80,200 plants per acre,
Climbing beans: Use a spacing of 60cm (between row) and 20cm (between plants). You may also check with
Seed Company and Research Institutions for correct spacing.
Inoculation
To be able to form nodules and fix nitrogen, bean seeds need rhizobia.
Each legume crop needs a different type of rhizobium bacteria. Rhizobia
are bacteria that are common in the soil and they fix nitrogen after
becoming established inside root nodules of legumes.
Always check out for the right inoculant for beans. Directions/steps for
using inoculants are described below;
Steps of inoculation of bean seeds
•	 Measure 15 kg of legume seed, this will be approximately 15 litres.
Place in any container that will accommodate the seeds.
•	 Measure one soda bottle (300 ml) of clean lukewarm water (40oC).
•	 Pour the water into a larger bottle (500 ml plastic bottle)
•	 Add 2 tablespoons of sugar to the water.
•	 Mix thoroughly to get an even solution of sugar. This solution is called the sticker.
•	 Add the sticker to the seed.
•	 Mix the seed with sticker solution until all the seeds are evenly coated.
•	 Add the rhizobium inoculant of 125g black powder onto the seeds and sticker.
•	 Mix the seeds and the inoculant thoroughly but gently until all seeds are uniformly covered with the
inoculant.
•	 Protect the inoculated seed from direct sunlight by covering the container with paper, cloth or gunny bag
and keep under a shade until planted.
• Plant the inoculated seeds as soon as possible in well prepared moist field.
For smaller amounts of seed, use 4 teaspoons or soda bottle-tops (20 ml) of the sticker solution, and 2 heaped
teaspoons or soda bottle-tops (10 g) of inoculant for every 1 kg of seed.

Intercropping:
•	 Where intercropping is practiced, adjust the spacing as per
recommendation. Bush beans can be intercropped with maize,
sorghum, coffee, cassava or banana however, the beans do not
grow very well when over shaded.
•	 Various plant spacing combinations can be used in an intercrop.
Examples include:
a)	Two rows of beans with one row of maize at a spacing 100cm
by 25 cm for maize and 50cm by 10cm for beans
b)	Two rows of maize with two rows of beans
Where climbing beans are intercropped with maize especially for support, beans should be planted 2 weeks
after maize, so that the maize stems are strong enough to support the bean plant.
When planting different bean varieties, make sure to maintain a space of 2 meters between plots where each
different variety is planted to prevent mixing of varieties.
2.8:   Planting depth
2.9:  Methods of Planting and Related Equipment
The speed at which seed germinates and emerges out of soil depends on planting depth, soil moisture and
temperatures. Beans are best planted at the depth of 5 cm and lightly covered with a layer of soil. Deeper
planting may lead to delays in emergence and low or poor germination. On the other hand, surface planting
may lead to poor germination as the seed may not obtain sufficient moisture needed for emergence and it also
exposes the seed to rodents and other vermins.
Traditionally, farmers in Uganda use hand hoes.  For ease of work, farmers
should work in teams of three people; one for digging holes, second
person placing fertilizers and covering it with a thin soil layer and the
third person placing seeds and final covering.

11
In case of poor soils, farmers
should apply basal fertilizer
(organic and or inorganic) at
planting. Use only recommended
fertilizers especially after testing
your soils.
Follow recommended application rates e.g. 50kg of DAP per acre (one bottle cup per hole) depending on
initial soil fertility status, use crop specific fertilizers (blended fertilizers) where available.  Beans require modest
amounts of nitrogen because of the symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria that transform atmospheric nitrogen
into nitrates available to the plants.
After planting, inspect your field 3 to 4 days after germination to ensure that a healthy crop is produced. Any gaps
in the row as result of seed failing to germinate or other seedling damages should be addressed immediately by
gap filling.
For mechanized planting, tractors or oxen are
mounted with special equipment for planting are used.
Digging of holes, placing of fertilizers and placing of
seed is done simultaneously. Check the machine well
before the anticipated planting date to make proper
adjustment. Always read the operator’s manual and
seek advice from the suppliers for effective usage.
2.10:   Basal Fertilizer Application:
Always cover the fertilizers lightly with soil before placing the seed, because
most fertilizers are corrosive.

This module focusses on management practices during beans crop growth and includes; staking climbing beans,
weed management, soil fertility management and pests and disease control.
Module Three:
Crop Management Practices
3.1:   Staking of climbing beans
The practice of providing climbing crops with support is known as staking. Climbing beans grow vertically
and thus need support and this helps the plants to grow faster, healthier and help rto reduce disease attack
especially anthracnose, the plant accesses enough light and produce higher yields. Staked beans can be harvested
over a more continuous period compared to bush beans.  Staking is usually done on crops planted in rows with
the stakes placed between the crop rows. Staking should be done 2 weeks after germination when the plants
start forming tendrils for climbing.
One stake can support one to three plants, depending on the bean variety and the strength of the stake, and
overall, about 18,220 stakes are required per acre. An average stake length is 2.5 meters.
The technology of staking can be; by wooden material or wiring using different materials. For wood, the
common tree species from which stakes are produced are bamboo, Acacia mearnsii (black wattle), Calliandra
spp, Eucalyptus spp, Markhamia lutea, and Sesbania sesban. Stakes can also be made from dry or fresh wood.
They can also be cut from reeds or maize stalks, especially when other staking materials are scarce. Generally,
tree stakes can be used for 2-3 seasons depending on type.
Wire staking involves use of non-wood threads such as metal wires, banana fibers, sisal threads and other
feasible materials together with few strong poles which support the threads. The poles remain fixed and can be
reused in the successive seasons while threads are stakes removed and put on seasonal basis.
Where maize stalks are used, plant climbing beans right after maize harvest so that the old maize stem functions
as stakes. This structure is not very strong and beans cannot climb high, so yields will be lower.

3.2:   Weed Management
Effective weed control is a prerequisite for high bean yields. Beans, being low-growing plants, struggle to compete
with weeds. Early control of weeds recommended at 2-3 weeks after planting is extremely important, because
the root system of the plant develops at this stage and some weeds secrete chemical inhibitors which limit
plant growth. It is also recommended to weed 5-6 weeks after planting to avoid weeds hampering with the
harvesting and threshing processes, and not to adversely affect the quality of the crop. Control of weeds can be
by mechanical and or chemical means.
3.2.1 Weeds and their effects on beans
Weeds are plants that grow where they not wanted. It is very important to control weeds in the early stages of
crop development to avoid their effects on the bean crop.
Effects of Weeds on beans
•	 Weeds reduce yield by competing with the bean crop for minerals, light and moisture especially during the
early stages of crop growth.
•	 Some weeds are alternative hosts of pests and diseases
• A thick growth of weeds in beans makes harvesting difficult.
•	 The weed seeds and shoots increase labor for winnowing and sorting; they also reduce the purity and/or
quality and market price of harvested grain
3.2.2 Categories of weeds
Annual weeds:
These complete their life cycle within one season.  In most cases, the seeds produced by annual weeds will
germinate very fast and even grow faster than the bean crop itself.  These weeds will interfere with the growth
of the crop during the critical period of the first four weeks. Annual weeds also produce a lot of seed which can
survive and germinate the following season. Examples include, black jack, goat weed, wandering jew etc
Perennial weeds:
These carry on from one season to another. The weeds persist in bean garden all the time every year and
reproduce through roots, stems (rhizomes) and seeds.  It is very difficult to control perennial weeds using
mechanical methods because only the top of the weed is cut, the bottom continues consuming the nutrients
and water meant for the bean plants.  Perennial weeds should be controlled early before the beginning of the
planting season.  Examples include; couch grass, spear grass, etc

3.2.2 Categories of weeds
Weed management must be addressed with a holistic approach and begins with correct land preparation.
Identification of the main weed types will determine the correct control methods to use. The common methods
of control include cultural practices, mechanical and application of chemicals using selective herbicides.
Preventative and Cultural weed methods refer to any technique that involves maintaining field conditions
such that weeds are less likely to become established and/or increase in numbers. They include use of clean
seed (uncontaminated by weed seeds), site selection, land preparation, timely planting, soil fertility management,
proper spacing, crop rotation, mulching etc
Manual weed control involves the use of farm tools and equipment like hoes, rakes, fork jembes, and pangas,
among others. It should be done carefully to avoid damages to the crop. Always earth up as you weed to help
the crop become stronger and help secondary root system develop especially where there has been effects of
bean fly attack and root rot.
Mechanized weed control: Involves use of mechanized farm equipment such as ox-traction weeders, tractor
weeders (tines) that remove weeds from the gardens. Beans must be planted in rows and weeding takes place
at particular crop growth
Chemical control- This method of weed control either speeds up, stops, or changes the weed’s normal growth
patterns. This in turn causes the leaves, stems and roots to dry out.
Herbicides are very effective if used properly. Farmers using herbicides need to know the type, the correct
dosage and stage to apply the herbicide.

All safety precaution measures need to be adhered to and all label instructions strictly followed.

Advantages of Chemical weed control
•	 Herbicides are very effective and take a short time to work.
•	 Reduces the amount of tillage hence labour saving
•	 There no root damage and no soil disturbance to bring more weeds seeds to the surface for germination
•	 Herbicides are a must under zero or minimum tillage

If the incorrect herbicide is used, the consequences could be disastrous. Herbicides are also expensive and may
be a health hazard (poisonous) to the user when not properly used
Only selective herbicides should be used during weeding. Selective herbicides act against weeds by killing all
other plants and leave only beans to grow. Selective herbicides are most effective if applied on weeds when they
are actively growing. These herbicides are important for weeding beans gardens. Examples include Bentazon,
Beans clean
Avoid weeding when the crop is flowering to avoid flower dropping
Avoid weedin Always use recommended herbicides at their recommended
rates and wear protective clothing when using herbicides when the crop is
flowering to avoid flower dropping.

3.3:   Improvement and Management of Soil Fertility
Plants need nutrients and water to grow and give good yields.  Most of the nutrients come from the soil and
hence soils have to be fertile to sustain plant yields.

A fertile or healthy soil should:
a.	Be deep enough and well drained
b.	Have good structure, texture and well aerated for proper root development.
c.	Have a favourable soil reaction (i.e. degree of acidity and alkalinity pH range 5.5 to 6.5 for most crops)
d.	Have a good supply of both available and reserve plant nutrients
e.	Be able to store soluble nutrients
f. Contain sufficient organic matter >2%
g. Support a wide range of micro and macro organism (fauna and flora)
3.3.1 Causes of Soil Nutrient losses/Soil infertility
Nutrient mining is the removing of more nutrients (from the soil through crop harvest, soil erosion, etc.) than
what is replaced through addition of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Soil nutrient losses can result from the
following ways;
a.	Loss of soil cover by destruction or removal of crop residues;
b.	Accelerated loss of soil organic matter through destruction of vegetation, ploughing, burning of crop
residues, decomposition etc.;
c. Poor soil physical properties leading to limited water infiltration and restricted rooting caused by soil
compaction;
d.	Soil erosion
e.	Leaching
f.	 Unusually low or high soil pH levels
3.3.2 Essential plant nutrients
These are nutrients that are required for the entire plant growth cycle. Deficiency of any one of these nutrients
will make plant have limited growth, affect flowering and or seed formation.
The essential plant nutrients are divided into two groups: macro nutrients and micro nutrients.
i)	Macronutrients are required by plants in relatively large quantities and include; Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus
(P), and Potassium (K), Sulphur (S), Calcium (Ca), and Magnesium (Mg)
ii)	Micronutrients (Trace elements) are required in small (or micro) amounts by plants. They include Manganese
(Mn), Iron (Fe), Boron (B), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Molybdenum (Mo), etc.
3.3.3 Signs of nutrient deficiency in beans
Role
Deficiency signs
Nitrogen
Contributes to the green colour
of the plant; is directly involved in
photosynthesis;
Lower leaves become  yellow and
eventually die. Young leaves may be
lighter green than normal. Growth is
stunted, few flowers develop and pods
fill poorly.

17
Phosphorous
Promotes early root formation,
and growth in young plants and
improves quality of grains, and
water-use efficiency
Beans usually take long to display
symptoms of P deficiency. By the time
a visual deficiency is recognized, it may
be too late to intervene.
Symptoms include small, dark green
upper leaves that turn purplish and
later die. Plants are stunted with thin
stems and the number of flowers, pods
and seeds are reduced, while seed and
fruit development is poor or absent
Potassium
Increases crop yield, water use
efficiency and disease resistance.
It also improves grain quality and
regulates the opening and closing
of stomata
The tips and edges of older leaves
appear burnt or scorched, and poor
filling of pods. The leaf midrib usually
remains green. Deficient plants stay
small and weak, and their leaves later
fall off. The pods are poorly filled
Calcium
Used in cell division and formation,
nitrogen metabolism, translocation
of carbohydrates from leaves to
fruiting organs and increases fruit
set
Stunting in stems, flowers and roots.
Leaves are curled or cupped with black
spots and yellow margins. Pods wilt and
seeds fail to develop.
Magnesium
Used in chlorophyll production,
improves utilization and mobility of
phosphorus, activates many plant
enzymes and influences earliness
and uniformity of maturity
Older leaves have yellowing between
leaf veins; but veins stay green
Boron
Is an essential in protein and
carbohydrate metabolism., seed
and cell wall formation and for
germination of pollen grains and
growth of pollen tubes.
Stems abnormally thickened,
longitudinal splitting of epicotyl, death
of growing points and inter-vienal
chlorosis on middle aged leaves.
Iron
Needed for chlorophyll formation,
plant respiration, formation of
some proteins, and enhances N
fixation rates.
Yellowing occurs between the veins
of the newest growth. The veins will
remain green except in extreme cases.

18
Manganese
Involved in photosynthesis and
chlorophyll production and helps
to activate enzymes involved in the
distribution of growth regulators
within the plant.
Stunting and yellowing between veins
of young leaves. Leaves gradually turn
pale-green with darker green next to
the veins.
Zinc
Important in seed formation. Plays
a role in chlorophyll, carbohydrate
and starch production, and aids
plant growth hormones and
enzyme system
Younger leaves first become mottled
and show interveinal chlorosis, with
browning of the older leaves.when
deficiency is severe, the area between
leaf veins will become light green and
yellow near the leaf tips and outer
edges.
A general downward curl of the leaves
also occurs and pod set will be poor.
Plants tend to be stunted due to
shortening of the internodes.
Molybdenum
Aids in the formation of nodules
supports nitrogen metabolism,
pollen viability and seed
production
Early deficiency symptoms are similar
to nitrogen deficiency. Affected plants
become stunted and lack vigour. Leaves
may turn brown along the margins.
Deficiency leads to poor nodule
formation.
3.3.4 Soil fertility management
Beans grow well on fertile soils but where soils are deficiency in nutrients, the use of fertilizers is encouraged.
Soil fertility can be improved through use of:
•	 Organic manure
•	 Inorganic fertilizer
•	 Other soil amendment practices.
3.3.4.1 Organic manure
These are decaying organic matter or humus derived from plant and animal residues.  They include: farm yard
manure, compost manure, green manure and organic mulches. Organic fertilizers maintain soil structure, improve
water holding capacity and improve aeration in addition to providing the majority nutrients for plant growth.
Application of organic manure
In one acre, use 2 to 4 tons of manure, it should be applied during ploughing and should have decomposed for
at least 2 to 3 months. Planting should be done after two to three weeks from the date of manure application.
Compost manure
Crop residues and organic household wastes are left to decompose for two to three months, after which the
compost is ready for use.

19
The compositing process
Requirement: dry plant materials, water, ash, green plant materials, animal droppings and top soil
Steps
1.	Making the base: Find a shady area, dig a pit for the compost or use the wooden box design and make a bed
with twigs or stalks
2.	Chop the materials and heap the layers; sprinkle water to help the heap rot; add animal droppings from
chicken, goat cow; add top soil for insects and worms; add green plant material; sprinkle with ash for
potassium, and water. Repeat the layers 3 or 4 times and cover with soil and dry grass to keep the compost
moist.
3.	After 3 weeks, turn the heap layer by layer (this helps the rotting process). After another 3 weeks, the
compost will be ready.
NB: Use a temperature stick to monitor the rotting of the heap. Composting manure is applicable for smallholder
farmers
Application of compost manure:
- Using a small container to a size of 3 spades, or a half basin,
- distribute the well decomposed manure in the field evenly
-and hallow/dig it up, so that it mixes well into the soil and plant after 2 to 3 weeks
Benefits of composite manure
•	 It’s cheap to make because of the readily available raw materials
•	 It improves soil texture, water holding capacity and nutrient up-take
•	 Gradually release of nutrients for a period of time
3.3.4.2 Inorganic fertilizers
These are manufactured fertilizers which rapidly provide/release nutrients to the plant.  The inorganic fertilizers
provide specific nutrients, which are lacking in the soil.  Examples of inorganic fertilizers include DAP, UREA,
MOP, NPK, TSP, blended fertilizers to cater for specific crop needs.
Fertilizer is supplied in form of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P) and Potassium (K). For the solid particles,
mineral fertilizers can be of many different sizes and shapes: from granules, pellets to fine powder (dust), but
also available in larger compacted granules that release nutrients slowly.

20
i)  Factors to consider when using fertilizer:
•	 Availability,
•	 Affordability
•	 And accessibility
•	 Awareness
Accessibility
Fertilizers are in most cases with the agro-dealers, stockists in urban, and at Sub county level, in most cases
fertilizer distribution chain stops at Sub County level. Farmer need to be aware of the distribution chain.
Always buy recommended inorganic fertilizers from reputable suppliers or dealers. Ensure that the bags are well
labelled with all necessary information such as the numbers and nutrient symbols of the contents (percentage
of content by weight), the total weight and expiry date.
Availability
This depends on what farmers demand and what the stockists have in stock
Affordability
The fertilizer should be cost effectiveness, and farmers must be willing to pay for the fertilizers.
Awareness
Farmers knowledge of soil nutrients availability and need for the nutrients
ii)	The 4Rs of fertilizer application:
a)	The Right Source of nutrients needed by a plant - Matching fertilizer type to crop need eg application TSP,
DAP, SSP at planting time in the soils which are low in phosphorous to establish roots.
NOTE; in highly acidic soils, lime should be applied in appropriate rate to allow uptake of nutrient by the crop.
b)	At the Right Rate to supply the quantity needed by the plant - Matching amount of fertilizer type to crop
needs or growth stage. For instance, at planting, plants require more of P for root development.  Amount to
apply should be equivalent to the amount the crop is likely to remove from the soil. Beans needs 12 – 24
kg P2O5 per acre basing on soil tests
c)	At the Right Time to be taken by the plant - fertilizers should be applied when the soil is moist. Under water
stress crops, the nutrients cannot move from the soil through the plant system
d)	In the Right Place accessed by plant roots (within 10cm in farrows)- Keep nutrients where crops can use
them. Place fertilizer near plants but avoid contact between fertilizer with seed or plant.
Powder (e.g. single
superphosphate
Crystals (e.g. ammonium
sulphate)
Supergranules (urea
supergranules)
Liquid fertilizer
NPK
Prills, granules (e.g.
urea, diammonium
phosphate)

21
3.3.5 Other methods to manage soil fertility include:
• Practice minimum tillage. In a used field, spray with a non-selective herbicide (Glyphosate), after 14 days,
make fallows or hole (basins) and plant with minimal disturbance of soil.
•	 Soil and water conservation: construct contour bunds and terraces on steep slopes, planting cover crops to
limit loss of water and soil nutrients.
•	 Correct soil pH by liming: Beans grow well an optimum soil pH) ranges from 5.8 to 6.5 and are very
sensitive to highly acidic (pH < 5,2) soils. Beans will also not grow well in soils that are compacted, too
alkaline or poorly drained.
•	 Crop rotation: Beans should be grown in a rotation sequence of legume, cereals, root crops and back to
legumes so as to reduce; the risk of depleting the soil of specific nutrients and to break disease and pest
cycles
•	 Intercropping: Beans can be intercropped with cereals to manage soil fertility. This has been discussed in
details under Module 2.4
•	 Fallow management: for farmers with adequate land, fallowing or allowing the land to rest for   at least 2
years to rejuvenate the soils is advisable. However, in case, of inadequate land, a rotation program should be
observed to reduce pests and disease accumulation.
To maximize bean yield, use the right type of fertilizers, the
recommended rates and methods of application after carrying out
soil testing
3.4:   Field Pests and Disease Management
Beans are attacked by several pests and diseases while in field. The level of pests and disease incidence depends
on the presence of the causing organisms, weather, soil conditions, and the relative resistance or susceptibility of
the variety.  Management techniques to minimize losses due to pests and disease attack include:
Biological
•	 Habitat manipulation
• Modification of cultural practices and
•	 Use of resistant varieties

Damage Done
Control Measures
Cutworms
Agrotis sp; The larva is dull, hairless
brown, or black and hides in the
soil near the cut plants
Larvae feed on
roots and base of stem killing
seedlings
•	 Early planting
•	 During primary tillage, dig soil to
expose larvae to predators such as
birds and ants
•	 Hand pick and destroy the larvae
•	 Apply recommended insecticides
such as Thiamethoxam to the
ground around affected plants

22
Bean fly (Bean stem maggot)
Ophiomyia sp
A dults are small shiny black flies
with clear wings that reflect a
metallic blue colour in sunlight.
Female fly pierces the young
leaves to lay eggs and sucks
the exuding sap, leaving
yellow blotches on the leaves
Larvae tunnel into leaves and
down
petioles to the stem cutting
flow of nutrients causing
withering and drying
•	 Earth up soil around the plant to
cover the roots
•	 Plant early
•	 Provide adequate fertilization for
plant vigour
•	 Avoid planting beans near cowpea,
beans and other leguminous crops
•	 Use resistant varieties developed by
researchers
•	 Use treated seed
•	 Use insecticides under severe
attack examples include
Imidacloprid, Azadirachtin
Flower Thrips
Adults are tiny, slim, elongated,
shiny black and are distinguished
from other species of thrips by
pale bands across the top of the
forewings.
Feed on young leaves,
developing
flowers and pods causing
curling of leaves, flower
abortion and scars on pods
•	 Early planting
•	 Fertility management
•  Inspect flowers and Use
recommended insecticide e,g
Dimethoate 40% only when 10
thrips /flower are seen, early
detection important
•	 Spray with botanicals
Aphids
They suck plant sap Infested
leaves curl under and
inward and become severely
distorted.
Leaves also become mottled
due to viruses spread by
aphids.
•	 Early planting
•	 Fertility management
•	 Use bio-pesticides not harmful to
natural enemies e.g. neem, soapy
water
•	 Monitor crop regularly and apply
insecticide if
•	 at least 1 in 10 plants is
•	 heavily infested
•	 Examples of insecticides include
Dimethoate 40%, Azadichtin
Flower beetles
They feed on petals and
pollen of flowers.
•	 Remove the plant debris from the
field.
• Remove the weeds from field.
•	 Manually pick and destroy the
beetles

23
Foliage beetles
Ootheca spp
Adults defoliate the crop
while the larvae feeds on
roots causing patches of
yellowed plants in the field.
Such plants are stunted and
may dry up prematurely.
•	  Fertility management
•	 Crop rotation with non-host plants
e.g maize
• Plough the field after harvest to
expose the dormant adults, eggs
and larvae to sun heat
•	 Use recommended insecticide
only if 3 plants out 10 are heavily
infested or > 30% leaf loss
• During flowering stage treat when
> 3 beetles per plant seen.
•	 Spray when bees not active
Examples include Lambda-
cyhalothrin + Chlorpyrifos, Beta-
cyfluthrin
Pod borers
Feed on flowers, pods
and seeds causing flowers
abortion, wilting of pods,
shrivelled or half eaten seeds
and reduced quality of grain
•	 Crop rotation with non-host plants
• Scout the field for the pest and
initiate control at an early stage of
infestation
•	 Use systemic insecticides e.g
Acephate, Dimethoate
Pod sucking bugs
Bugs suck on pods causing
tiny depressions (dimples),
and may cause shrivelling and
rotting of the seeds, which
lose viability.
Hand collect and kill when few are seen
Well-timed (45 days after planting)
application of insecticides such as
Cypermethrin + Dimethoate
Bean Bruchid
Infestation starts from the
field. The larvae bore into
bean seeds leaving them
perforated with holes.
Cause faecal contamination
•	 Timely harvest (before shattering of
pods)
•	 dry seeds thoroughly before
storage
•	 Clean the storage facility prior to
storage
•	 Use a disinfectant like Actellic dust
or fumigate aluminium phosphide
•	 Do not store old beans with newly
harvested beans
•	 Store beans in air-tight containers
e.g hermetic bags/silos

3.4.2 Major Bean Diseases and Associated Control Measures
Most diseases affecting beans are caused by fungi and bacteria; and can cause 60 to 100% yield loss if not well
controlled.
Disease
Transmission
Symptoms/signs
Control
Common
blight
•Survives in the
seed but may also
be carried over in
diseased debris.
Bacteria spread
by rain, wind or
mechanical means.
Initial symptoms are small, water-soaked spots
on the underside of the leaves, which enlarge
and merge to form large brown irregular
lesions surrounded by a narrow yellow zone.
Pods have sunken circular spots which are
initially water-soaked but later dry, with a
reddish brown narrow border. Under wet
conditions, yellow slimy bacterial exudates
ooze out of the lesions and form a crust.
•	 Use healthy seed.
•	 Remove all infected
portions of the plant
or the entire plant
from the garden, as
soon as disease is
detected.
•	 Practice crop
rotation
•	 Spray with Mancozeb
Halo blight
Transmission
similar to Common
Blight Disease: in
seeds, plant debris,
rain splash and by
physical contact.
•Has a distinct yellowing around the initial
leaf spot, which spreads outwards, though
generally, the symptoms are similar to those of
common blight disease
Control is as for
common blight disease
Bean
Common
Mosaic Virus
(BCMV),
Bean
Common
Mosaic
Necrosis
Virus Disease
(BCMNV)
The virus may be
transmitted by
insects like aphids or
through the seed.
Symptoms range from puckering of the
leaflets along their midribs to leaflet mottling
and elongation; pod, leaf and petiole distortion;
dwarfing of leaves or of the entire plant; or
premature death of the plant. Affected leaves
may show light green or yellow and dark
green mosaic pattern.
• Use certified seeds;
•	 Rogue any plants
infected with the
virus
•	 Avoid adjacent
planting and
overlapping bean
crop during the rainy
season (i.e. only one
crop per rainy season

25
Bean
Anthracnose
Mainly seed-borne.
Can survive on
infected seed and
on crop debris. Rain
splash and wind will
spread the spores of
the fungus within the
crop.
Small reddish-brown, slightly-sunken spots
form on the pods and rapidly develop into
large, dark-sunken lesions. In moist weather,
masses of pink spores develop on these
lesions. Black-sunken spots, similar to those
on the pods, are produced on the stems and
the leaf stalks. Infection of the leaves causes
blackening along the veins, particularly on the
under surface.
•	 Use disease-free seed
certified seed
•	 Avoid cultivating and
harvesting an infected
crop when wet to
prevent the spread of
spores.
•	 Do not pack lightly
diseased pods as
anthracnose can
develop during
transport
•	 Use recommended
fungicides. Ref; annex
5
Bean rust
Survive mainly on
bean plant debris
of the previous
season and
volunteer crops.
Spread mainly by
wind and to a less
extent by farm
animals, insects
and implements.
The initial symptom small, whitish, slightly
raised spots which produce reddish
pustules, and later, turn dark-brown. The
leaves turn yellow, then brown and dry.
•	 Timely application of
fungicides.
•	 Use tolerant varieties
•	 Practice crop
rotation and
intercropping
•	 Avoid adjacent
planting and
overlapping bean
crop during the rainy
season
•	 Destroy infected
materials.
Fusarium
Wilt/
Fusarium
Yellows
•	 Infected soil is
the main source
of infection.
Other sources
are infected plant
residues and seed.
•	 Spread is through
irrigation, wind-
blown soil
particles and
contaminated
farm equipment.
•	 The fungus causes a reddish discoloration
throughout the root, stem, and petioles
Infection causes yellowing of lower leaves
and may progress to the upper leaves,
causing premature defoliation.
•	 Infected seedlings are stunted, wilt, and die.
The fungus can also cause water-soaked
lesions on pods.
•	 Crop rotation with
non-host crops
•	 Deep ploughing of
infected plant debris
•	 Use of organic
amendments such as
manure to improve
the soil fertility
•	  Seed dressing with
recommended
fungicides,
Bean root rot diseases

26
Fusarium
root rot
The main source of
infection is infected
soil.  Infected
seeds, drainage and
irrigation waters,
splashing rains, and
infected manure are
common means of
dissemination.
Survives in the soil
on decaying organic
matter.
The first symptom is reddish discoloration
of the taproot which gradually intensifies,
eventually turning brown, fissures develop and
the rot becomes dry and papery.
•	 Long-term rotations
(4 to 5 years) with
non-legumes
•	 Improve drainage and
avoid injury to the
root system.
•	 Planting in raised
beds or ridges and
hilling up soil around
the stem before
flowering.
•	 Apply farm yard
manure or other soil
amendments
•	 Deep plough infected
plant material during
land preparation.
Pythium
As for Fusarium root
rot
Damping-off of seedling. Also attacks lateral
roots causing plant wilt and death. The
pathogen can extensively prune roots and
destroy much of the hypocotyls and main root
system.
•	 As for Fusarium root
rot
Sclerotium
Root Rot
(white mold)
The disease is spread
by, wind-blown soil
particles and farm
tools and machinery.
•	 Symptoms initially appear on the stems just
below the soil line as grey water-soaked
lesions, which later become dark-brown
and extend downward to the tap-root,
leading to wilting. Foliage symptoms consist
of leaf yellowing and defoliation in the
upper plant branches, followed by sudden
wilt.
•	 A fan of silky white mould and large, round
sclerotia (which are at first white but
gradually become dark) appear at the base.
•	 As for Fusarium root

Module Four:
Safe Handling and use of Agro-
chemicals
4.1:   Agro-Chemicals
4.1.1  Groups of Agro-Chemicals
•	 Herbicides (for killing weeds/herbs)
•	 Insecticides (for insect pests
•	 Fungicides (for fungal diseases)
•	 Nematicides (for nematodes)
•	 Rodenticides (for rodent pests)
•	 Fertilizers (providing plant nutrients)
4.1.2  Advantages of using agro-chemicals
1.	Increases food production
2.	Improves quality of produce
3.	Decrease costs of production e,g use of herbicides
4.	Are labour saving
5. Increased profits for farmers
However, agro-chemicals are very harmful if not properly handled, can cause detrimental health hazards to the
user, consumer and the environment.
Example of health hazards include; Nausea, diarrhea, stomach ache, nasal bleeding, vomiting, loss of sight, dizziness,
and sometimes death.
Environmental hazards include pollution and contaminated of water bodies, bees and livestock death.
Agro-chemicals are crop protection products used in production and preservation of crops or crop products.
Agro-chemicals are becoming an increasingly integral part of crop production.
Agro-chemicals are poisonous substances that must be
handled carefully and safely
4.2:   Safe use of agro-chemicals
To optimize use of agro-chemicals, it is important that proper identification of the exact problem is undertaken.
4.2.1 Identification of the pest
The farmer should make sure that he/she has scouted his/her field and has identified the pest and level of
infestation. In case of any doubt, consult the extension worker or take a sample with you to the trusted and
qualified input stockiest or plant clinic.

28
4.2.2 Buying agro-chemicals,
Always buy chemicals from licensed and registered agro-input dealer shops.
•	 Read the label on the container for expiry date and any other important messages e.g active ingredient.
•	 Always buy pesticides in their original containers and also make sure the containers are intact.
•	 Where possible verify whether chemical is not a counterfeit by using Kakasa (e-tag) application.

Always get a receipt from the agro-input dealer indicating date of purchase, name of chemical and
batch number
4.2.3 Transporting the agro-chemicals
•	 Ensure that all containers are tightly sealed and the mode of
transportation does not cause any leaks or spillage.
•	 Never transport agro-chemicals with any food or feed items.
4.2.4 Storing Agro-Chemicals
In case a farmer is not using the agro-chemical immediately, he should store agro-chemicals in safe isolated
places (cupboards, shelves that are safely located) away from children and family members.
4.3:   Application of agro-chemicals
4.3.1 Reading the Product label
The label provides all the necessary information such as, active ingredient, mixing and application rates, first aid,
disposal of containers, pre-harvest and pre-entry intervals etc. Read the product label and follow instructions
on how to handle and apply the chemical. If you do not understand the instruction, seek advice from extension
agents.
Ensure that you buy the necessary protective clothing as recommended on the product label (cap, masks,
overalls, gumboots, gloves, goggles)
Look out for colur coding, warning symbols, pictogram, or any additional safety instructions on the label. (Agro-
chemicals are also classified according to their toxicity and should be used as recommended on the label of the
product).

4.3.2 Determining how much pesticide to use
The single most asked question in pesticide application is: “How much pesticide
(ml) do I put in a knapsack (20lts)?”  The answer is; it depends on the calibration
of your sprayer. In short, how many square metres one spray pump full of water
+ pesticide will cover.

Always Read the label for recommended dilution rate or dosage.
It is important that the amount of pesticide to be used is precise to avoid excess
that could lead wastage of resources, damage of the crop and contamination of
the environment. When quantity is inadequate, it is likely that the pest will not be
effectively controlled and this can result into pest resistance.
Steps of calibration of a knapsack sprayer
Every sprayer has a different capacity, different nozzles with higher or lower output. Also spray operators work
at a different speeds and pump at a higher or lower pressure. To realize appropriate application, there is need to
calibrate the spray equipment as follows:
1.	Measure and mark out an area of 10m x 10m = 100sq.m
2.	Fill the knapsack with known volume of water e.g 15 litres of water
3.	Put the knapsack on your back and start pumping, walk at a steady walking pace, spraying with the nozzle
at knee height and recite the word ‘one thousand’ over and over again making one pump stroke per ‘one
thousand’.
4.	Spray the marked area.
5.	After spraying, measure the litres of water that has remained in the spray tank (e.g 10lts remained)
6.	Amount used to spray area of 100sq.m = 15lts -10lts = 5lts
7.	To work out how much pesticide to measure into the sprayer is now very easy. Look at the application rate
on the product label.

eg. Roundup is 1.5L (=1500ml) per Acre and an acre = 4,000 sq. metres

To calculate how much to measure into your sprayer:
8.	Calculate the volume of water needed to spray an acre
If 5lts covers 100sq.m

An acre = 4000sq.m x 5lts
= 200lts
100sq.m
9.	Using Round up at a rate of 1.5lts/acre, calculate the amount of chemical for a knap sack of 20lt capacity as
200lts of water is need to dilute 1.5lts of Round up

Therefore a knapsack will require: 20lts x 1.5lts =  0.15lts of Roundup
200lts
1litre = 1000ml

0.15 x 1000ml = 150mls
10.
Farmer can also calculate needed mls per litre of water = 150ml/20 = 7.5ml.
Always Read the label for recommended dilution rate or
dosage.

4.3.3 Mixing Agro-Chemicals
Mixing and filling operations are the highest risk time for pesticide
accidents.
•	 Read the label carefully and understand the instruction.
•	 Ensure recommended rates are followed
• Always mix and fill outdoors to avoid pesticide fumes that can
concentrate in closed area
•	 Open pesticide containers with extreme care
•	 In case of spillage, wash it off with clean water as soon as possible
•	 Use clean water to mix chemicals
•	 Use suitable equipment for measuring out chemicals.
•	 Never use hands as scoops or for stirring liquids
•	 Add only enough pesticide to the tank for the job you will be
doing

4.3.4 Before Spraying
•	 Before spraying, check the spraying pump for any
leaks, use the right nozzle for the particular activity,
i.e the flat nozzles are for herbicide application,
the cone nozzles are for spraying fungicides and
insecticides.
•	 Check the nozzle for blockages, if clogged, do not
try to blow it out with your mouth, use a small
soft twig or grass or soft brush to remove the
clogs.
•	 Wear protective gear before spraying activities

4.3.5 During Spraying
• Put warning signs in field during spraying to alert the community.
•	 Do not spray near other people or water sources
•	 Spray in the direction of the wind.
•	 Walk within the rows and direct the nozzles to the targeted pest
•	 Preferably spray in the morning hours before 11.00 am or late in the evening after 4.00 pm bearing in mind
when the pest is most active
•	 Do not spray when it is about to rain or when it is raining
•	 Do not eat, drink or smoke while working with chemicals
•	 Minimize talking when spraying
•	 Do not touch your face or any other bare skin with soiled hands or gloves
•	 Apply the pesticide evenly and in the right amounts
•	  Turn off the equipment whenever you pause.
• If your co-worker shows signs of pesticide poisoning, stop the spraying immediately and begin first aid
measures

Always wear full protective gear to prevent skin contamination
Spraying in teams

31
4.3.5 After spraying:
• Use all the pesticide in the sprayer, at least spray it over adjacent field if it remains
•	 Do not leave pesticide containers at the application site
•	 Do not re-enter the treated area until after sometime (at least 24 hours)
4.3.6 Disposal of empty containers
•	 Rinse the empty container at least three times pour the rinse back to the spray pump
•	 If it a metallic, puncture it or if plastic bottle, cut it several times to avoid re-use.
•	 Select a disposal site away from home and mark it properly ‘’ Container disposal”
•	 Disposal off the containers following the guide lines on the label
4.3.7 Cleaning the spray pump and yourself
•	 While still dressed in protective gear, wash the knapsack and rinse it well to ensure that no residues remain
•	 Pour all the washing on bare ground
•	 Do not wash spray pumps near water sources like rivers, lakes or swamps
•	  Remove the protective gear ending with gloves. Wash the protective gear.
•	 Wash your body thoroughly well with clean water after spraying.
•	 Put on clean clothing
•	 Store the clean spray pump properly.
•	 Keep records of spray application

The Market requires supply of quality beans in desired quantities at desired time. Good quality beans attract
better market price that help farmers earn high income. Many times, farmers experience high losses of beans
from harvesting to marketing. It is estimated that farmers in Uganda loose up to 40% of their produce from
harvesting to marketing as a result of poor postharvest handling practices which results in poor quality of the
beans. It is therefore crucial for farmers to adhere to good practices to maintain the quality of beans during
harvesting and postharvest handling.
5.1.1 Harvesting
Harvesting is the process of removing the plant from the garden after it has
achieved full physiological maturity. To ensure quality, harvesting should be
carried out on time to avoid losses and deterioration of quality. Beans are
harvested at different physiological stages depending on the intended use.
When it is for fresh eating, it is harvested when the pods are tending to
yellow. If it is meant for dry grains, the whole plant is harvested when it has
dried and achieved full physiological maturity.
Bean Physiological Maturity:  Is stage when the crop has achieved maximum
growth (usually 58-120 days) after planting depending on the variety grown)
and has the following indicators:
•	 Bean leaves turn yellowish with mature veins
•	 Shading of leaves in some varieties accurs
•	 Seed texture hardens
•	 Seed colour becomes more pronounced
•	 Pods harden, becomes light brown
5.1.2 Methods of harvesting
Manual/ Hand harvesting.
Manual /Hand harvesting is the commonest method in Uganda and is considered practicable for crops under
small scale production. It is carried out by uprooting of bean plant from the soil. The activity requires 6-10
people /acre/day
Mechanical harvesting:
This is the harvesting of beans using machines and is suited
for large farms. Machines simultaneously harvest, thresh and
clean the grain. It has an advantage of ensuring quality, reducing
losses in addition to time & labour saving.
Module Five:
Harvesting and Post-harvest Handling

33
Common practices to avoid during harvesting
•	  Harvesting pre- mature/ early harvesting: This results into shrinkled and
rotten beans
•	  Delayed harvesting: Leads to attack by pests and animals, shattering of pods,
physical loss and rotting of grain
•	 Carrying soil on the roots of the harvested beans: This increases
contamination opportunities for aflatoxins and other contaminants
• Leaving the beans to dry in the field after they are harvested: Leads to
attack of pests and animals, shattering of pods, loss of grain and rotting
Quality control measures (the DO’s) ALWAYS:
•	 For fresh beans, harvest as pods start yellowing.
•	 For dry beans, harvest when pods turn brown.
•	 For climbing beans continue harvesting as they mature
•	 Place the harvested plants on a tarpaulin or mat
•	 Where weather does not allow uniform drying of beans in the garden, carry out selective harvesting
Delayed harvest causing
shattering of beans

5.2:   Postharvest handling (PHH)
Postharvest handling practices are activities carried out immediately after harvesting and they include;
transportation, drying, threshing, cleaning, packaging and storage. Good PHH practices ensure that the harvested
product reaches the consumers in the desired quality and quantity
5.2.1 Transportation:
Beans are transported home for further activities to be carried out. Transportation is carried on head, bicycles,
motorcycles and vehicles depending the volume of produce.
5.2.2 Drying of beans in the pods
Drying is the systematic reduction of crop moisture down to
safe levels for storage. It is one of the key postharvest operations
that ensures bean grain quality. During harvesting the moisture
content of grain is between 18-24% and this should be reduced
to 14% for safe handling.
During drying, the following steps should be observed:
a.	Sort the beans to remove weeds and immature pods.
b.	Spread the beans loosely on the tarpaulin, drying rack, drying
yard and mat to allow drying of the pods.
c.	Dry the beans until the pods can easily open to release the
grain.
5.2.3 Threshing of beans
This is the process of separating the bean grain from the pods to make grain
available for further processes. Threshing can be carried out on threshing
rack (fig. xx) that protects the seed from damage, dirt and prevents it
from scattering. A threshing rack consists of strips of wood arranged on a
platform with a wire mesh that sieves seed from chuff. Grain is collected
on the bottom tray or tarpaulin. Scattering of grain during threshing is
prevented by the high wooden sides.
Beans threshing rack

34
Methods of threshing
a.	Hand threshing: Beans are threshed by gently beating the pods with a stick.
b.	Manual bean thresher: (illustration) Human powered (hands or peddle)
machine used for removing grain from the pods
c.	Motorized bean thresher:  It is a machine used for removing grain from pods.
The machine is equipped with a fan that helps in blowing off the chuff from the
grain.
Note: After the beans have been threshed, clean for further drying.
5.2.4 Drying threshed grain/
After threshing, the grain contains higher moisture content than the standard. It is therefore recommended
that grain be dried further to the desired moisture content level.  Dry the grain on a clean tarpaulin, plastic
sheets, mats and drying yards. Where big volumes are involved, use a drying
machine.
Methods and technologies of drying
a. Sun Drying
Drying is carried out in the open air on tarpaulin, mats, plastic sheets,
drying yards and collapsible dryers.
b. Mechanical drying
Hot air is blown in the grain to remove excessive moisture under controlled
conditions. Hot air is generated using burning fuel, solar, electricity and
biomass.
During drying of the grains, take note of the following precautions to ensure quality
•	 Turn the grain regularly to hasten and ensure uniformity of drying especially when using sun drying
•	 Keep off animals from beans to avoid contamination of grain with animal droppings
•	 Protect the grain from adverse weather conditions by covering the grain with tarpaulin or keeping it under
well ventilated facility
•	 For mechanical drying, ensure appropriate temperature is maintained through close monitoring of the
temperature. and care should be taken not to exceed 400C for bean grains
•	 Ensure close monitoring of the the moisture content to ensure that recommended standard is achieved
•	 Dry the bean grains until required moisture content is attained
5.2.5 Methods of checking moisture content
Traditional methods
•	 Shaking grain in a tin and judging from the sound
made: grain with high MC gives a dull sound
compared to the sharp sound made by dry grain.
•	 Pushing the hand into grain bulk: wet grain offers
more resistance to penetration than dry grain. In
addition, grain with high moisture content has high
temperatures in the middle due to high metabolic
rate while grain with optimum moisture content is
cold in the middle.
Motorized bean thresher
Biting the grain with teeth
Deeping the hand into the grain

35
•	 Biting with teeth: a dry bean is relatively hard and cracks when you bite with teeth while grain with high
moisture content is soft, the teeth penetrates when you try to bite
•	 Salt method: Take a small sample of bean grain mixed with dry salt, put it in a clean dry jar, shake it vigorously
for several minutes and allow it to settle. If salt becomes wet and sticks on
the wall of the jar, then the grain has high moisture content above 15% and
therefore it needs to be dried further.
Scientific means
•	 Moisture meter: It is the equipment used for measuring moisture content
in grain. It measures the percentage moisture content in a given sample.
Different types exist on the market depending on the manufacturer.
5.2.6 Grain cleaning
It is the removal of foreign material and un conforming beans from the normal
ones.  A number of technologies are employed to clean the grain and they include;
traditional winnower and mechanical cleaners (human and motor operated),
Cleaning technologies
Traditional winnower- Common at small holder farmer level, winnowers of different
shapes and material are used to clean the grain. Farmers usually take advantage
of the wind so that it can remove some of the light dirt during winnowing. One
person can clean 100 kgs per hour.
Use of screen/sieve- Common at bulking sites and warehouses. A screen/sieve
mounted on a wooden frame is used for cleaning. It is more efficient than
using a traditional winnower. One person can clean 500 kgs per hour. Foreign
materials and dirt that are smaller than the screen size pass through. One of its
shortcomings is that grains that can pass through the screen have to be sorted
from the dirt and this increases the labour time. On the other hand, foreign
material that is bigger than the screen hole size and none conforming grains have
to be removed by hand.
Mechanical cleaners- These are machines that are operated by engines or mortars
and have capacity to clean above 1ton/h with automated sorting system based
on the quality parameters like colour, size, and shape. They are appropriate for
big companies, bulking centers and warehouses where big volumes of grain are
being handled.
5.2.7 Storage
Storage is the process of keeping grain until an appropriate time of use. The primary aim of storage is for quality
maintenance, food & nutrition security, seed and better price. Note: Good Storage does not improve grain
quality but it maintains it.
Storage Technologies
Various storage technologies (traditional and modern) can be used by smallholder farmers to store bean grain
and these include;
Bean grains with chaff
Women winowing beans

Triple/Pics bags
•	 Flatbed Warehouse/Silo
•	 Grain store (Farm level)
Hermetic storage is an airtight facility that allows for maximum protection of stored
products from insect infestation. It seals off the exchange of oxygen and moisture
between the produce and environment
Advantages of hermetic storage include:
•	 Eliminates the use of chemicals in controlling storage pests
•	 Beans can be stored safely for more than12 months
•	 Stores seed without losing seed viability
•	 Simple to use
•	 affordable by small holder farmers
Where big volumes of produce are required to be stored, a grain store/
bulking centre/ware house is used and good storage management
practices are required to ensure grain quality. The type of storage facility
depends on volume of grain, purpose and the financial resources.
Storage management
Reception
This is the process of receiving grain into a storage facility and involves the
following;
1.	Inspection; Grain received for bulking is checked for physical appearance
and any possible signs of non-conformity to grain standards.
2.	Sampling; Small quantities of grain are taken from different bags for
analysis (EAS 902).
3.	 Testing; analysing grain samples as per set quality standards (EAS 2).
4.  Off Loading: If the grain meets quality standards, it is offloaded, Weighed
and Recorded
5. Stacking (bagged); Offloaded grain is placed on pallets in a design that
will ensure safety, stock taking, fumigation and ease of movement within
the facility. The stacks of the produce should be 1m away from the wall
to allow inspection. Where produce covers the whole store, a corridor
of 1.5m should be left in the middle. When stacking bags, space of 1.5m
from the roof should be left. For silos storage, grain is poured on a
reception pit and conveyed to the silos by elevators.
6.	Stacks should be placed by crossing the layers to increase stability.
Organize the produce in a well-defined pattern to ensure safety, easy stock taking and air flow as indicated
in the lay out below (Fig. xxx). Note: bags of the same weight and shape should be stacked together
7.	Where hermetic grain storage tank/bag has been used, it should be placed on pallets/dunnage poles/ wooden
platform.

General Hygiene Practices
Storage facilities and surrounding environment should be kept in good hygienic
conditions to ensure quality and safety of the product.
•	 The store should be cleaned thoroughly before and after storage of produce
• The floor, walls and roof should be cleaned regularly to remove the dust,
cobwebs and any other dirt
•	 During cleaning, the stacks should be covered with tarpaulins or canvas to
avoid contamination
•	 Bush surrounding the storage facility should be cleared regularly to avoid
inhabiting rodents and other insects
•	 Avoid heaping rubbish near the storage facility to keep away rodents and
other sources of contamination
•	 Storage facility should have access to social amenities as per the required
standards
•	 Storage structures on poles should have rat guards
•	 Ensure that the store is closed all the time and is opened as and when
required
•	 Ventilators and other outlets should have screens that prevent rodents, birds and insects from entering the
store
•	 Nonfood materials must not be kept in grain store. They should be kept in a separate nonfood store.
•	 Avoid storing bean grain with chemicals like herbicides, fumigants, pesticides, fuel and other materials that
are hazardous (harmful, dangerous) to life
• Avoid fire in the storage area. It should be a “NO SMOKING” zone. Flammable materials should not be
kept near the food store
•	 In case other types of food are kept it the store, each type of produce should be stacked separately to void
mixing of produce and cross contamination.
Good storage practices
It is important to inspect the internal and external areas of the store.
• Regularly, check the store for signs of water leakage, floor cracks and crevices, signs of damage on bags
(rodent or insect), leakage of grain on the floor, presence of live insects and any signs of contamination.
•	 Always inspect the surrounding environment to ensure hygiene
•	 Carry out quality control checks on a regular schedule
•	 Carry out fumigation to control storage insect infestation (Use licensed and professional fumigator)
•	 Ensure FIFO rule when handling stock in storage

During storage, beans like other grains is attacked by insect pests, moulds, and rodents like rats.  Pests form the
major problem in a storage especially where good storage management practices are not adhered to.
5.3.1 Pest Control
A number of pests attack grain during storage and they include;
5.3:   Storage pests, mycotoxins and their control
Storage infrastructure design and maintenance:
The following should be taken into consideration to ensure good conditions of bean grain storage:
•	 The roof should be leak proof
• The floor should be impermeable and easy to clean
•	 The walls should be easy to clean
• There should be sufficient ventilation for easy flow of air to remove disorders that may develop during
storage and cool the stored bean grain/ produce (Note: Fans, cyclones and transparent sheets are not
recommended on grain storage structures)

Record keeping
Storage records are required for quality control good handling practices and business management. They include;
• Stack cards (The stack card fixed to a bag stack, used to keep a tally of the number and weight of bags of
grain either added or removed from the stack.
•	 Received stock ledger book
•	 Outgoing stock ledger book
•	 Quality control records
•	 Cleaning records
•	 Fumigation records

5.3.2 Control of pests
Storage pests can be controlled by physical, chemical and biological methods. Improved storage technologies
like the use of hermetic technologies can be used to control pests. Grain infested with weevils when stored in
a hermetic storage the insects die due to suffocation.
Fumigation
This is the application of chemicals/fumigants in controlling storage pests of food mainly grains. Fumigants
commonly used include; phosphine
Widely used fumigants include:
•	 Phosphine
•	 1,3-dichloropropene
•	 Chloropicrin
•	 Methyl isocyanate
•	 Hydrogen cyanide
•	 Ethylene dibromide
• Sulfuryl fluoride
•	 Formaldehyde
•	 Iodoform
•	 Acrylonitrile
•	 Ethylene oxide
Phosphine is the commonly used fumigant for controlling storage insects however misuse leads to development
of resistance of some storage insects.
Safety precaution: Fumigation is a hazardous operation. It is a legal requirement that the operator
who carries out fumigation operation holds official certification to perform the fumigation as the
chemicals used are toxic to most forms of life, including humans.[1]
Advantages of fumigants:
•	 Toxic to a wide range of pests
•	 Can penetrate cracks, crevices, wood, and tightly packed areas such as soil or stored grains
•	 Single treatment usually kills most pests in treated area
Disadvantages of fumigants:
• Nonspecific in that they are usually highly toxic to humans and all other living organisms
• Require the use of specialized protective equipment, including respirators specifically approved for use with
fumigants
Safety measures during fumigation (see safe use pesticides)
•	 The target site must be enclosed or covered to prevent the gas from escaping
•	 Keep fumigants safely and out of reach of ordinary persons. Only licensed persons should carry out the
fumigation work.

40
•	 Wear protective clothing.
•	 Wash and preferably take bath after fumigation.
•	 Use a display board indicating the fumigant being used, date of application and person in charge.
•	 Aerate the grain and stores after uncovering.
5.3.3 Mycotoxins
Mycotoxins are poisonous substances produced by fungi which contaminate grains under poor postharvest
handling practices. The common mycotoxins and fumonisins which are known to cause cancer and growth
impairment in children and can cause death if taken in high doses. Humans and animals are all affected by
consumption of food and feeds containing mycotoxins.

41
Value addition can take a number of forms such as drying, threshing, cleaning, sorting, milling, packaging and
branding depending on the level of the value chain. Quality control is the first step to adding value to any
produce. Value addition is important because of the following:
•	 high market prices
•	 extended shelf life
• diversifies grain products hence alternative sources of incomes
Module Six:
Value Addition
This normally done at farm level and bulking centers.
Beans to less extent can be milled to produce value-added bean products such as bean-based flours, bean
cookies and snacks.
The bio fortified beans are bred to have high levels of iron and zinc. They can be grown easily like any other
common beans that farmers are growing. The only difference with these beans is that they have relatively
higher levels of iron and zinc and this translates into higher levels of these nutrients being taken up by whoever
consumes them.
Under new technologies and innovations, selected bean varieties are pre-cooked under high temperatures and
pressure resulting into dry processed pre-cooked beans. The product is packed in various types of packaging
materials made of weather-proof aluminium sachets, plastic containers and bags of varying sizes and sold to the
market/ consumers.  The product has a shelf of up to 6 months.
Canned beans
Beans are further processed by cooking through steaming and packed in tins.

42
A market is an arrangement which facilitates exchange of goods and
services. It can also be a place or forum where buyers and seller meet to
perform their transactions.
Marketing of beans consists of all activities involved in moving beans and
bean products from the point of production to the point of consumption
(Farm to the plate). In other words, marketing involves all those activities
linking producers and consumers. Effective marketing should ensure
that goods are supplied according to the demand i.e on time and of the
quantity and quality that consumers want.
Module Seven:
Marketing of Beans
Beans are mainly marketed as fresh or dried grain. However, there
also exist niche or specialized beans. These may include; milled bean
flour, canned, or frozen beans, snap or French beans and pre-cooked
dehydrated beans
Fresh beans are marketed with their pods in various markets in the
country while in urban areas, pods are opened and sold as fresh beans.
Dry beans are sold at local, regional and international markets. The
local market is comprised of individuals, institutions (schools, hospitals,
prisons, army), relief organizations, processors and traders.  Markets
demand varying standards ranging from color, variety and size.
Access to competitive markets requires establishment of both backward and forward linkages between organized
farmers (suppliers) and buyers (customers). Farmers need to access other value chain support services such as
market information, transport, warehousing, financing, and packaging to enable them produce good quality beans
in big quantities as desired by the market.

43
Entrepreneurship: Capacity and willingness to develop, organise and manage a business venture along with
any of its risks in order to make profits. Bean farmer can become an entrepreneur if he/she comes up with
technology innovations and adoptions that will help him increase on his net profits. It is important therefore that
bean farmers acquire good entrepreneurship skills to enable them access better markets.
Marketing of beans follows the 7Ps model (Product, Price, Place, Promotion, Packaging, Positioning and People)
and 2Cs (Customers and Competition). For beans to be sold to the market, there must be people who want to
buy it (the customers), at the same time, sellers must be aware of the competition on the market.

5
Packaging
The way the product is presented to the customers. This creates impression
that effects consumers decision to purchase.
6

are high. Form of marketing that presents the benefits of your products to a
particular audience
7
People
Marketing of beans require people to purchase and to aid in marketing

44
Farmers or stakeholder taking beans to market should first carry out market research to establish:
•	 the price being offered by buyers,
•	  players involved in the market
•	  other competitors that are willing to supply beans.
Sources of information include; district commercial offices, traders’ information desk, NGOs, short message
services (SMS) via phones, e-market apps, extension officers, media, traders and processors involved in grain
trade etc. A beans entrepreneur will be successful in marketing if he/she: knows his/her customers, needs wants
and sets attractive but competitive prices.
7.4.1 Group/collective marketing in beans business
Marketing as a group involves gathering products from individual entrepreneurs and selling collectively. In order
for group marketing to be effective, entrepreneurs should produce the same variety of bean synchronizing their
production operations (planting, inputs used eg seeds, fertilizers, harvesting) and postharvest operations (sorting
and grading of the product).
For smallholder farmers to access competitive markets; they should enter into group marketing/collective
marketing (horizontal linkages) to attain big volumes and have marketing contracts with big buyers or marketing
facilities (vertical linkages) e.g WFP
7.4.2 Advantages of collective marketing
•	 Attracts large-scale bean buyers such as NGOs, relief agencies and cross-border customers (e.g. Rwanda,
South Sudan) and export market
•	 Provides bean entrepreneurs with more bargaining power (in terms of prices, sales volume, time of delivery
of the beans etc).
•	 Makes small scale farming competitive - small farmers can access technology, credit, marketing channels and
information while lowering transaction costs
•	 Reduces costs if activities are carried out as a group (transporting, grading and packaging of the beans are
costs that can be shared).
•	 Promotes access to better marketing information and marketing advisory services.
•	 Improves quality of products due to timely and sequenced production.
•	 Enables groups to purchase quality inputs and transport in bulk.
•	 Provides a link to get trainings from the off- takers, NGO, implementing partners and government extension.
7.4.3 Challenges of collective marketing
Although collective marketing is beneficial to organized groups, the following challenges should be taken into
consideration by group members:
• It may be difficult for the group to agree on crucial issues (decision making)
• Dishonesty/non-transparency among members especially the marketing committee may lead to conflicts.
•	 Poor record keeping may lead to losses.
•	 It requires safe collection and holding centers in accessible areas, which is not always possible in rural areas.
thefts or losses can occur if the bulking facility is in a location that is poorly secured.
•	 Good road infrastructure is required to attract large scale buyers to remote/rural areas
•	 It may require heavy capital investments for assets such as, storage facilities and vehicles for transport.

7.4.4 Key success factors in group marketing
For group marketing to be successful, the following factors are critical:
•	 Members should be knowledgeable on business management.
•	 Members should attend group meetings regularly and participate actively in decision making.
•	 There should be mutual trust among members with emphasis on ethics and integrity.
•	 The group should have dedicated and committed leaders who are democratically elected.
•	 The group should have clear and enforceable bye-laws on corrupt and unaccountable leadership.
• There should be clearly defined roles and responsibilities especially in relation to promotion and marketing
of group products.
• Existence of rural finance institutions from which to borrow additional capital funds to help finance the
group’s marketing operations.
•	 Conducting regular pre-production planning.
•	 Having access to marketing information through market research.
•	 Uniformity of group’s product (beans) in terms of variety, size, quality, packaging, grading etc.
•	 Having access to safe storage facilities with good road infrastructure.
•	 The group should have accurate record keeping.
• There should be transparent and equitable distribution of benefits.
Beans producers may sell their beans through
•	 The warehousing receipt system or commodity exchange
•	 Through contracting
Warehouse Receipting System (WRS):  In this system, the farmer deposits his/her grain in a certified warehouse
and is issued with a warehouse receipt document.  The receipt provides proof of ownership that a specified
quantity and quality of grain has been deposited at a particular certified warehouse by a named depositor.
Benefit of the WRS
• Provides storage services to the farmers/suppliers that have insufficient storage facilities hence reducing
postharvest losses.
•	 Enables grain supplier to sell their grain when market conditions and prices are favourable
•	 Ensures quality grain to the market
•	 Offers quality assurance services to the grain handlers
•	 Enables farmers or depositors get access to cash faster against the warehouse receipt
•	 Eliminates issues of delayed payments to farmers
• Eliminates the need to use title deeds as security for financing grain growers
Commodity Exchange:   A commodity exchange is an open and organized market place where commodities
are traded.  It brings together many buyers and sellers. This effectively results in the greatest concentration of
trading for a given product. It creates a mechanism for price discovery (true market position price for a product
at that particular point in time) to occur in an organized manner through a system of price bidding or an auction
Contract farming
In contract farming, agricultural production carried out according to an agreement between a buyer and farmers.
It establishes conditions for production and marketing of beans for a specified time. Typically, farmer(s) agrees to
provide agreed quantities and quality of beans according to the set quality standards. In turn, the buyer commits
to purchase the product and, in some cases, to support production through, for example, the supply of farm
7.5:   Other Marketing Channels

46
inputs, land preparation and the provision of technical advice. This method is common with Community based
bean seed multipliers.
Advantages of contract farming
• It ensures higher production of better quality, financial support in cash and /or in kind and technical guidance
to the farmers
•	 Assured market for farmers produce
•	 It reduces the risk of production, price and marketing costs.
•	 Contract farming can open up new markets which would otherwise be unavailable to small farmers.
•	 In case of agri-processing level, it ensures consistent supply of agricultural produce with quality, at right time
and lesser cost.
These are activities or products required for successful execution of marketing of beans. Support services are a
necessity but also come with added costs (marketing costs). Examples of marketing costs are; cleaning, grading
and packaging, handling, transport, storage, finance, insurance etc.
Financing: Beans like other enterprises require financial resources at different levels of the value chain. Financial
services can be accessed from financial institutions such as; banks, microfinance institutions, SACCOs, external
borrowing, leasing, hire purchase
Insurance: Importance of insurance is to hedge the beans value chain actors against agriculture risks/natural
disasters over which they have limited or no control. The commodity for trade should be insured at all times
whether in store or being transported. Warehouses should have full insurance cover against fire, burglary and
other risks.
Transport: Transport is a major component of the beans trading and a well aligned transport logistics are
necessary for the efficiency in the marketing effort. Transport costs vary depending on the distance between the
farmer and the market, and the mode of transport used.
Market information: Market information is facts and figures that will help farmers, and other value chain actors
involved in the marketing process to make informed decisions and minimize their risks. It may include current
selling price of produce, potential buyers, quality and quantities needed; the price of inputs etc.

Benefits of access to market information to the farmer include:
•	 Farmers’ bargaining power is increased.
•	 Farmers enabled to access more markets.
•	 Farmers’ decision making is improved in terms of; what to produce, how much to produce, price to charge,
how to promote the product, when and where to sell the product.
Source of market information include buyers, farmers’ organizations, fellow farmer, media (newspapers, magazines,
TV, radio), exhibitions (shows, fairs and field days), extension workers, developmental agencies (NGOs, CBOs
WFP) as well as use ICT – internet messages, short message services (SMS)
License and taxation
For proper trade, ensure that you pay the business license, local authority taxes (Cess taxes) and sales taxes.
7.6:   Support services in beans marketing

47
Benefits of business license include:
•	 Legal Protection: A business license protects the owner against being shut down for having an illegal business.
•	 Credibility: A license helps reassure customers that they are dealing with a legitimate business. and not a
scam
•	 Financial requisition. To qualify for funds, a business must possess a business license
•	 Business licenses are important because they provide a record of all businesses who may owe tax to the
government.

48
A standard is a document that provides requirements, specifications, guidelines, or characteristics that can be
used consistently to ensure that products, materials, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
Standards are developed by national, regional and international standards institutions often to enforce legislation.
These bodies issue specifications for commodities as well as methods of testing.
Module Eight:
Beans Grain Standards
• Complying with standards reduces post-harvest losses and ensures final product is of high quality.
•	 Farmers get better prices, traders and processors get reliable supply of grain that they can sell to their
clients.
•	 Consumers get food that is safe and nutritious to eat.
•	 Facilitates both national and regional trade
The dry beans standard requires that grain should be free from foreign smell, diseases (moulds), live insects and
insect damage, weed seeds, other edible grains, discoloration, immature/shriveled beans, animal droppings and
any other contaminants such heavy metal, chemical residues.
Dry beans shall comply with maximum limits given in table below when tested in accordance with the test
methods specified therein. Dry beans shall be categorized into three grades on basis of tolerable limits established

Dry beans shall be prepared, packed, stored, transported and distributed under hygienic conditions in accordance
with CAC/RCP1-1969. This implies that maximum care must be taken to ensure that Dry beans are packaged
in clean containers by clean people.
The areas that the dry beans are stored should be clean and meet hygiene standards. These stores should be
free from pests e.g. rats, cockroaches, weevils and other vermin. Modes of transport should also be clean.
When tested by appropriate methods of sampling and examination the dry beans shall be free from pathogenic
micro-organisms, substances originating from micro-organisms, or other poisonous or deleterious substances
in amount(s) which may constitute a health hazard.
Quality requirement
Current market trends and regulations require safe food to be availed to the market. Consumers of beans and
its products expect to consume safe and good quality beans products. Dry beans must meet quality standards.
Farmers should know that beans quality assurance involves prevention of defects from the earliest stages of
cultivation. Therefore, quality of bean grain starts from proper land preparation up to when beans are sold.  It is
therefore, important to ensure good practices are followed at all levels.
Aflatoxins and fumonisins
Aflatoxins and fumonisins are poisons released by certain moulds. They come from soil and air and grow when
grain is handled poorly.  Aflatoxins are not visible by eyes. Determination of   presence and level of aflatoxin is
done in analytical laboratories and the tests are very expensive. Aflatoxin can cause cancer and liver damage.
Consumption of high levels of aflatoxin can cause cancer and liver damage and may also lead to death. Always
avoid growth of fungus at all stages of the bean value chain.
Other Contaminants (heavy metals, chemical residues)
Dry beans shall comply with limits for heavy metals specified in CODEX STAN 193 established by the Codex
Alimentarius Commission. Heavy metal quantities can only be determined by testing in a laboratory using a
special equipment. The contaminant limits are:

Arsenic                                    0.1 mg/Kg

Cadmium                                 0.1 mg/Kg

Lead                                         0.2 mg/Kg

Mercury                                   0.1 mg/Kg

Tin                                            0.1 mg/Kg
1Mg/Kg is equivalent to ppm (parts per million)
Pesticide residues:
Pesticide residue means any specified substance in food, agricultural commodities or animal feed resulting from
the use of pesticides. Dry beans shall comply with those maximum pesticide residue limits established by the
Codex Alimentarius Commission for this commodity
Grain Grading
Grain grading is a process of categorizing grain based on certain quality parameters. This informs decisions such
as storage of the grain, uses of the grain and the purchase price
Method of Sampling
Sampling shall be done in accordance with the ISO 24333
8.3:   Hygiene

Pathogenic micro-organisms are those minute living microbes that may cause diseases. They are commonly
referred to as germs. They include harmful various bacteria, yeasts and moulds. A quick test for these harmful
bacteria is determination of coliforms. This is done by incubating a weighed sample in specific media at specified
temperature for a period of 48 hours.
•	 Dry beans shall be packed in suitable packages which shall be clean, sound, free from insect, fungal infestation
and the packaging material shall be food grade. Food grade material, made of substances which are safe and
suitable for their intended use and which will not impart any toxic substances or undesirable odour or
flavour to the product.
•	 Dry beans shall be packed in containers which will safeguard the hygienic, nutritional, technological and
organoleptic qualities of the products.
•	 Each package shall contain dry beans of the same type and of the same grade designation.
•	 If dry beans are presented in bags, the bags shall also be free of pests and contaminants.
•	 Each package shall be securely closed and sealed.
The following information shall be provided in order to comply with the requirements of EAS 38 and EAS 46.

A business is a commercial activity designed to supply goods and/ or services that are demanded by the
market with a major aim of making profit.  Farming as a business is built on the principles of improving farm
production to increase profits and/or ensure sustainability of farm output. To make profits in a business, the
cost of production must not exceed income. Farmers need to understand and update business practices as
technology changes.
Farming as a business requires farmers to have entrepreneurship skills that can enable them carry out farming
on a commercial scale.
Module Nine:
Farming as a Business
Farming as business is based on the commitment of the farmer entrepreneur to carry out farming as an
occupation with a major aim of making profits. The farmer must ensure proper business planning; enterprise
selection, business record keeping and as well as farm enterprise budgeting.
For commercial farming to be a viable venture, farmers must accurately know their cost of production, margins
and how to maximize profits by lowering costs of production while increasing yield.
Acreage: An area of land that can be used for agricultural purposes. It is measured in acres or hectares. However,
different communities use different units for measurements of land area. 1 acre = 4000 square meters, 1 hectare
= 2.5 acres = 10,000 square meters
The size of a farm land- is very important for;
•	 Planning accurate input requirements
•	 Forecasting potential yield and income
•	 Evaluating performance (potential vs actual)
Land is the principle capital for a business enterprise therefore it must be optimally utilized
Yield: It is the output per unit area. Usually expressed as: Kilograms per hectare (Kgs/ha) but is commonly
expressed as kilograms per acre (Kgs/Acre). However, in most farming communities, it is expressed it in terms
of bags/acre or otherwise. Yield can only be known if one knows the land size and the weight of the harvest.
Yield potential: Maximum yield that can be achieved, assuming all factors are favorable. It is determined by seed
variety as specified by scientist who developed it. E.g NABE 4 is 800 – 1000kg/acre, and NABE 12C is 1000 –
1400 kg/acre.
Yield potential should be the target at planning. Other value chain management practices will determine the
deviation from the potential (100%)
9.1:   Commercial farming

52
Productivity
This is the yield per acre (Kgs/acre). As a commercial farmer, it is important to aim at maximum productivity as
this determines the total volume of produce supplied to the market. The bigger the volume, the higher the sales
and the higher the profits, assuming other factors are held constant.
Profitability
A state of yielding profit or financial gain from a business activity and depends on how the farmer manages costs
of production, yield and market price. It is expressed as;
Profit = Sales – Costs of Production
Benefits of farming as a business
Farmers that engage in Farming as a business enjoy the following benefits:
i. Growth in income as a result of increased profit margins.
ii.	Improved standards of living due to increased income.
iii.	Diversity of consumed products purchased using increased income.
iv.	Improved nutrition and household food security.
v. Increased productivity and efficiency of the family farm
i. Invest resources with a profit motive
ii.	Provide products or services of value to satisfy the market in exchange for a monetary return
iii. Legal and ethical activities with a defined purpose: Businesses undertake activities that conform to the
laws and standards of the society in which they operate, and they clearly state what they exist to do for
customers and stakeholders, including their core business
iv.	Plan, analyze the environment, and manage risk: Businesses must undertake planning to, continuously check
what happens within and outside of the businesses, stay alert to uncertain events, and work to reduce
potential loss.
v.	Record keeping: Businesses out to keep up-to-date records for reference in planning and decision making
vi.	Relationship management and continuity: Businesses should develop long-term relations with other
stakeholders and continue to operate even beyond the life of the founder
9.2:   Principles of business
Farming as business = Inputs (seed, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides,
farm equipment) + Processes (land preparation, planting, weeding, fertilizer
application, harvesting, and output marketing) = Beans grain at a profit.
A poor plan is better than no plan, and not planning is planning to fail
Farm planning is an important aspect of farm business and it involves setting where the business is going (goals)
and how to get there (strategy). A successful farm is not the result of chance or luck - it is the result of good
planning. Planning is the process of thinking through what is desired and how it will be achieved. Plans must
be made before any other management activities can be performed. Assessment of past, present and expected
future performance are integral to the planning process.
9.3:   Farm planning and decision making

53
Risk refers to the probability of occurrence of hazards and shocks that impact negatively on agricultural
production, trade, markets and consumption. These could be due to weather, diseases, pests, market, and price.
Risk management are the measures put in place by the farmer to avoid or minimize the negative impact of
hazards and shocks. Managing risk is very important for the success of agricultural operations. While some
risks can be managed through changes in farming and marketing practices, others cannot be avoided as they are
natural (for example, droughts and floods). Therefore, managers of farm businesses need to focus on managing
manageable risks and take measures to reduce the negative impact of those that are uncontrollable.
Bean farming like other businesses is supposed to generate income but this is not always certain. This is because
businesses operate in a rapidly changing and unpredictable environment that impacts upon the outcomes of
business activities. While the physical, political, economic, social, technological, and trading environment presents
opportunities for business, it also offers threats that make business risky. However, this does not stop businesses
from operating. Entrepreneurs have to expect, accept, and manage risks as they relate to business. An identified
risk is not a threat but a management problem.
Risk and associated mitigations
It is important to take time to analyze past financial and production records to find out which production
practices worked well which did not and identify weak spots and while planning for present consider internal
(resource availability) and external (markets, economy, weather) forces on the decision-making process.  There
is need to emphasize joint family household planning and visioning to agree on tasks and roles.

This is the documentation of all the farming activities. Farm records facilitate quick reference to previous
activities and this enables the farmer to make quick informed decision. Record keeping also provides useful
information for assessing the performance of a business at any time. It is important for farmers to emphasise
record keeping to enable them carry out financial analysis and budgeting as well as making informed business
decisions
Farm records include; human resource, finance, production, operation, storage, and marketing.
Types of Farm records
i.	 Human Resource:
These include; details of the labor force, leave calendar and profiles of the workers for the farm
ii.	Financial:
They include;
•
Invoices: document issued by the seller to the buyer demanding payment for the goods and services

offered. It indicates the quantity, unit price, taxes and details of the payee.
•
Payment vouchers: A document prepared to pay service providers after invoices have been received

and verified
•
Receipts: It is a document issued acknowledging payment
•
Pay in books: Documents indicating money you have paid in the bank
•
Cash book: contains information of the money banked, received and spent
iii.Operation:
These are records that contain all farm activities as part of farming as a business. A farmer needs to design
a simple comprehensive record entry/ report which can easily be understood by all the people on the farm.
Records must be easy to understand and written in such a way that they can easily be accessed for analysis.
iv.	Storage:
•
Stock card: It is a document in form of a card hanged on a batch of food product or grain indicating

the quantity of stock you have at that time. You can also have stock card for all inputs at your farm.

Keeping track of stock helps with identifying theft, guarding against wastage and unnecessary

purchases and planning for production
•
Stack Card: Card fixed to a bag stack used to keep a tally of the number and weight of bags of grain

either added or removed from the stack.
•
Goods Received Note (GRN): Document issued out to acknowledge receipt of goods
•
Received Stock ledger books: Records of the stock that has been received in the store/ware house
•
Outgoing stock ledger books: Records of stock that has been removed from the store

Resource mobilization are activities involved in securing required inputs and products for the given program.
It involves making better of, and maximizing existing resources such as land, capital and labour (human) that
determine the day to day activities and accomplishments. For any given farm activity, it is important to know the
resources required and how they can be acquired.
Resource management refers to decision making process (setting goal) whereby limited resources (information,
land, labour and capital) are allocated to a number of production, marketing, and financing alternatives.
Sources of finance
Savings:
Saving is an act and a habit of putting money away to use at a
future date. This can be in the form of cash or material goods
whose value appreciates over time. It entails discipline and
sacrifice, as one postpones consumption from now to a future
date. It leads to capital accumulation over time, which can be
invested in profitable enterprises.
Why saving is important
•	 Source of capital for farm investment
•	 Easy source of soft loan for the farmer
•	 It helps in meeting household needs like paying school fees,
hospital bills and buying food.
•	 Money can be used to expand a business.
•	 Many organizations that provide loan will want to see that a farmer has the ability to save before giving him/
her a loan.
•	 Saving can be used to meet urgent unforeseen emergencies.
•	 Saving allows a farmer to keep their money safe.
9.6:   Resource mobilization and management
•
Quality control records: Records for quality status of the stored grain.
•
Fumigation records: Records indicating fumigation activities carried out on the farm
v.	 Marketing:
•
List of customers
•
Price lists
•
Details of buyers and quantities desired by the market
•
Product types
Characteristics of good records
•	 It should be simple and easy to use. If your record keeping system is complicated, it is more likely to
generate mistakes.
• The financial records maintained should have appropriate level of details depending upon the type of your
business. A more complex farm operation requires a more detailed system.
•	 A good system provides essential information in a timely manner. Make sure that your records provide
essential information on a timely basis.

56
Loan or credit
A loan or credit is money borrowed by an individual from relatives, friends, groups, moneylenders, micro-finance
institutions (MFIs) or banks in order to meet either social or economic obligations. A loan is usually paid back
over a specified period of time with or without interest depending on the source and purpose. Where the loan
is acquired for agricultural development, it is referred to as agricultural credit.

Pre-requisites of accessing agricultural credit
•	 Must be a commercial farmer
•	 Have production records.
•	 Has understanding of credit facilities.
•	 Willingness to pay back
•	 Must have a business plan
It is advisable that agricultural credit be used to finance;
•	 Yield -enhancing inputs and technologies e.g. inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, opening up land)
•	 Cost reducing inputs such as herbicides
A loan has a cost(interest) that will increase total cost, therefore your yield must increase significantly to both cover this
cost and make more profits than a non-borrower.
Registration of small-holder farmers is through farmer groups, associations and cooperatives. Large scale farmers
can register as companies and this will require a business name, physical location, Articles of Association and
other relevant documents as required by the law.
A business plan is written description of a business’ future. It is a road map that describes what you plan to do
and how you plan to do it.  It is an important first step for any size of business- no matter how simple a business
is. It helps to get organized and make sure all necessary steps are taken and acts as a guide to help you think
carefully about what you want to farm and what to achieve in future. It is one the documents always required
by funders and finance institutions when applying for laoan or seeking credit.
A simple but good business plan should include:
•	 The goal – the direction of the business
• Plans to make your farm more efficient or more profitable.
•	 What crops are being planted and what acreage.
•	 The stages of planting to marketing of beans and what activities need to done at each of this stage.
•	 Yield and prices used to estimate income.
•	 How to market your products.
•	 Business expenses to be incurred.
•	 Additional resource needed (source of funds e.g saving, loans etc)
•	 How to measure success of your business
• Cashflow of the business

NB: When conducting training on CBA, the table should include all the realistic activities carried during the selected
enterprise from production up to marketing.
Gross Margin = Sales – Costs of production
1. Tradition approach: Profit = 400,000 – 203,000   = Shs.197,000
2. Low in put:
Profit = 1,000,000 – 467,000 = Shs. 533,000
3. High input:
Profit = 2,000,000 – 859,000 = Shs. 1,141,000
During enterprise selection, profitability of the enterprise should be taken as key. One of the ways for determining
the profitability is by carrying out Cost Benefit Analysis of the enterprise.
Gross Margin = Sales – Costs of production
Note: Costs of production involves total costs from production to marketing.

Based on the calculation above, it is clear that high input method generates high margins and therefore, high
income. The farmer can use the information to make investment decision.
High profitability leads to quick return on investment.

Climate change is the shift in the average weather conditions of an area observed over a long period (30
years and above) of time. Climate Change effects are accelerated by human activities such as deforestation,
burning of fossil fuels among others. This is mostly evidenced by the overall trend in raising maximum and falling
minimum global temperatures. Climate change may affect the beans value chain in various ways depending on
the agro ecological zones. It reduces the prediction predictability of seasonal weather patterns and increases the
frequency and intensity of severe weather events e.g. floods, drought and hailstorms.
Module Ten:
Climate Change
Climate Change risks include negative impacts on, crop production, and farmers’ livelihoods mainly resulting
from prolonged dry spells, erratic and excessive rains, storms and lightening. Some regions experience floods
while others have prolonged dry spell, pest and disease build up and water shortages which may result into poor
quality and low beans yields. Climate variation, also contributes to the destruction of infrastructure e.g. road
network and market.  All these factors threaten the overall agricultural production value chain.
Crop production
• Unpredictable rainfall patterns affect planning for field activities such
as sowing, weeding, applying inputs especially fertilizers and harvesting,
this results into crop failure hence low yields and poor crop quality
leading to food insecurity
•	  Prolonged dry spell causes water shortages resulting in low yields
•	 Prolonged dry spell cause crop pest outbreaks
•	 Floods destroy bean gardens, cause water logging, rotting and increase
diseases build up.
• Excessive rains affect beans especially at flowering
•	 In mountainous areas, excessive rain may cause landslide leading to destruction of bean gardens, homes and
infrastructure
Socio-economics
•	 Land degradation due to cutting down of trees, bush burning, silting of rivers, destruction of river banks
•	 Decreased crop yield
•	 Decreased income
•	 Increased production costs
•	 Food insecurity
•	 Increased poverty levels
• Increased migration of the communities e.g. from flooded/landslide areas.
•	 Labour shortage due to migration
•	 Destruction of the infrastructures (road & markets)
•	 Increase in human diseases e.g. Cholera and Malaria
•	 Water shortage.
10.1:   Climate Change risks
10.2:   Climate Change Impacts on:
Effect of drought on beans production

60
There are two approaches to responding to climate change impacts. These include climate change adaptation
and mitigation measures.
Climate Change adaptation refers to the making of anticipatory or reactive adjustments to prepare for expected
climate variability and changing average climate conditions, to moderate harm and exploit beneficial opportunities
in agriculture such as climate smart agricultural practices.
Climate change mitigation refers to efforts taken to reduce or prevent emission of Green House Gases that
warm the planet. These include planting trees, use of environment friendly technologies, -renewable energies
(such as solar, biogas etc.)
10.3:   Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change effects on

Beans value chain
There is a need to address effects of Climate Change on production, storage, processing and packaging of
agricultural products such as beans.
10.4:   Why Adapt to Climate Change in the Beans Value Chain?
10.5:   Climate Smart Agriculture Practices on the farm
Practice
Why the practice
1. Soil testing
To determine soil fertility levels so that in case of certain mineral
deficiencies they can be added back.
2.Pay attention to seasonal
weather forecast
so that expected weather patterns are known and are followed by
farmers; because lack of early warning information perpetuates untimely
planting and harvesting leading to increased post-harvest losses
3. Practice minimum tillage e.g.
basin conservation farming
Reduces the cost of production, improves soil texture, conserve soil
moisture especially in dry areas
4. Plant certified, early maturing
and high yielding beans varieties
better suited to weather
conditions
Certified for quality assurance, early maturing (60days) & high yielding to
withstand drought & disease.
5. Safely use recommended agro-
chemicals to control weeds, pests,
and diseases
Safety is emphasized to avoid harm on farmer, the plant and the
consumer. Apply agro-chemicals at recommended rates. Buy from
registered/Licensed agro-input dealers and follow the crop cycle to
manage diseases & pests such that you realize optimum yield.
6. Practice crop rotation
It is prudent to rotate (beans –cereals -root crops then back to beans)
to break pests and diseases buildup, improve the soil texture

61
While most of the Climate Change adaptation strategies such as conservation agriculture focus on effects of
climate change on production, there is little consideration on appropriate climate smart interventions to cater
for post-harvest value chain issues such as storage, processing and packaging. Below are the recommended
climate smart agricultural practices for on farm, postharvest handling, storage and marketing.
10.6:   Climate smart practices for post-harvest handling and storage
10.7:   Climate smart practices for marketing
Practice
Why the practice
10. Threshing
Thresh on a raised platform or on tarpaulins to maintain good bean
quality and minimize losses
11.Dry beans using tarpaulins,
concrete floors and mats
To maintain good bean quality, minimize losses and aflatoxin
contamination. Ensure that beans are dried to 13%mc,
12. Dry beans using recommended
driers e.g. solar driers.
To maintain good bean quality, minimize losses and aflatoxin
contamination.  Beans are dried to 13%mc
13. Dry bean to the recommended
moisture content (13%) before
storage
To maintain good bean quality, minimize losses and aflatoxin
contamination.
14. Store beans in dry safe places and
on pallets, and air tight containers
(hermetic storage)
To maintain good bean quality, minimize losses and aflatoxin
contamination.
Practice
Why the practice
Grade and package beans
To obtain better prices
Sell off fresh dried beans when they
are of good quality, good mc and well
sorted
To minimize losses, attract competitive prices and builds good farmer’s
reputation for quality.
Practice
Why the practice
7. Harvest water for agricultural
production
To irrigate bean crops during the dry spell
8.Plant boundary trees and hedge
row
To have wind breaks, control soil erosion, fix nitrogen, improve soil
texture & fertility
9. Harvest of beans during cool
weather
To avoid losses in yield due to shuttering. Thresh and use the residues
(Stover) for mulching.

62
10.8:   Mitigation practices on the farm
Practice
Why the practice
Agroforestry (fruit trees, shade
trees)
Trees are carbon sinks which reduces on the accumulation of Green
House Gases in the atmosphere. Fruit trees provide food while shade
trees fix nitrogen in the soil.
Use of renewable energies
To prevent emission of Greenhouse gases

Simply the cash flow is an educated guess about when and how much money will come into and go out of
your business. The cash flow and sales forecast will enable you to decide what you can afford, when you can
afford it and how you will keep your business operating on a month-to-month basis. As part of the business
plan, a cash flow and sales projection will give you a much better idea of how much capital investment your
business idea needs.
(iii)
Balance Sheet
The balance sheet describes the assets, liabilities, and equity of a business at a particular point in time. It is a
widely used accounting statement that indicates the economic resources of your organization and the claim
on those resources by creditors. It shows the assets of the business and the debts/liabilities of the business

Notes:
• The first season is commonly dominated by planting in March up to Mid-April and harvesting in June-July
•	 The second season shows variations in the planting and harvesting period depending on the region.
•	 The Southwestern region plants late for the second season i.e . November compared to other regions.
•	 There is a trading opportunity for Eastern, Central and North ern regions to supply beans in Southwestern
in the month of December before the latter harvest
