We acknowledge owners and staff of the tissue culture laboratories and nurseries in Burundi, Kenya
and Uganda where some of the training sessions took place, and support staff of the International
Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and Volunteer Efforts for Development Concern (VEDCO) who
facilitated the sessions. We also thank the many trainees, both farmers and potential nursery
operators, who gave valuable, practical input during the writing of the manual.
This manual was published with funds provided by the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation
and Development (BMZ) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) as
part of the 2008â€“2011 project â€˜Banana tissue culture: community dissemination pathways for
delivery of high quality planting material to create markets for African farmersâ€™. Additional funds
from the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Program on Roots,
Tubers, and Bananas (CRP-RTB) allowed us to print many more copies of the manual. The project
was led by IITA in collaboration with Bioversity International, Georg August UniversitÃ¤t GÃ¶ttingen
(Germany), Institute de Recherche Agronomique et Zootechnique (Burundi), Jomo Kenyatta
University of Agriculture and Technology (Kenya), National Agricultural Research Organization
(Uganda), UniversitÃ¤t Hohenheim (Germany), VEDCO (Uganda) and Zanzibar Commission for
Agriculture (Tanzania). Emily Ouma (IITA) and Piet Van Asten (IITA) are greatly acknowledged for
technical assistance, as well as the very helpful comments from four anonymous reviewers. The
manual was edited by Anne Moorhead.


Banana is an essential staple crop throughout the Great Lakes region of East Africa. It is also an
important source of trade and income. To safeguard sustainable banana production and generate
wealth for smallholder farmers, high quality planting material is crucial.
Banana in smallholder farmer systems in East Africa is traditionally propagated by means of suckers,
which contain pests and diseases. Plants produced through tissue culture are mostly free from pests
and diseases (with a few exceptions). There are many further benefits to using tissue culture plants:
(1) they are more vigorous, meaning faster growth and higher yields; (2) they are more uniform,
allowing for better planned marketing; and (3) they can be produced in large quantities in a short
period of time, facilitating distribution of both existing and new cultivars. In other words, tissue
culture technology can help banana farmers to make the transition from subsistence to income
generation.
However, there are hurdles that are limiting widespread uptake and optimal use of tissue culture
technology among smallholder farmers in East Africa. Distribution systems of tissue culture plantlets
to farmers are one key obstacle. Plantlets are often distributed in large quantities at subsidized
prices by various development partners, but this is not sustainable in the long run. Tissue culture
plantlets are fragile, and their thriving depends on good management by nursery operators and
farmers, especially in the early stages. This knowledge is currently mostly lacking. For nursery
operators, the correct handling of plantlets in humidity chambers and shadehouses determines
plantlet survival and quality. For farmers, plantlets need to be carefully and properly transported,
and receive suitable water and fertilizer to fully reap the benefits.
Switching to tissue culture technology from conventional suckers requires different skills and
knowledge for both nursery operators and farmers. For nursery operators, training in agronomic and
technical know-how, while important, is not sufficient; nursery owners also need business and
marketing skills to turn their nursery into a profit-making business. For farmers, the potentially
higher production and more uniform harvesting times of bananas will require good business and
marketing skills for them to fully benefit. Working together in groups has been shown (in Kenya and
Southern Uganda) to strengthen the position of farmers within the banana value chain; however
organizing into groups takes additional skills.
Promotion of tissue culture bananas has in the past been too focused on commercial tissue culture
producers. Therefore, in 2008, a project was launched which aimed at developing improved and
efficient pathways to deliver tissue culture plants to less commercial farmers. The project, titled
â€˜Banana tissue culture: community dissemination pathways for delivery of high quality planting
material to create markets for African farmersâ€™, was funded  by the Federal Ministry of Economic
Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale
Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). The project built on an earlier phase that demonstrated potential for tissue
culture technology with smallholder banana farmers. As part of the project, training was undertaken
in East Africa of tissue culture nursery operators and farmers. In Burundi and Uganda, over 700
farmers were trained during more than 250 training sessions, and 150 nursery operators during 20
training sessions. In Kenya, farmers and nursery operators were trained together, and 75 training
sessions were organized. The training courses were lengthy and detailed, with an individual farmer
or nursery operator attending up to 40 training events over the course of 1â€“2 years. This manual,
and the accompanying manual for training of nursery operators, are based on the training notes
from these courses.

This training manual can be used by anyone involved with training of smallholder tissue culture
farmers, such as extension agents or applied scientists. The manual is not intended as a guide for
farmers themselves. The trainings were mostly carried out by a facilitator and an assistant from
VEDCO and IITA.
The manual is organized into five modules, and each module is divided into sessions. The sessions
are based on actual training sessions carried in Central Uganda. Each session was carried out and
evaluated three or four times, with adaptation and fine-tuning along the way.
Most of the sessions are structured similarly: after listing the â€˜toolsâ€™ (personnel and equipment), the
activities are given as a series of steps. The actual content for each session is given below this, in a
coloured box. Each session concludes with a Q&A section, which includes actual questions posed
during the training.
We recommend that implementation of any training adheres as closely as possible to the format
detailed within the manual. However, modifications according to geography and farmer conditions
may be necessary.
The modules are organized in the order in which we recommend they be delivered, however they
are largely stand-alone and can be interchanged. Within a module, however, the order of the
sessions should remain fixed. The entire training course (all sessions from all modules) takes
approximately 1â€“2 years if modules are run sequentially, however modules can be run in parallel to
reduce the training period.
Some of the modules are relevant beyond tissue culture bananas, e.g. â€™Working in groupsâ€™, â€˜Business
skills for farmersâ€™ and â€˜Marketing for farmersâ€™ can be applied to business activities beyond growing
of bananas.

Specialized tissue culture laboratories (see table on next page) carry out the first stages of tissue
culture banana production. These are:
1.Initiation: The meristem is taken from a plant in the field and transferred into sterile, specialized
media in the laboratory, where the tissue develops into shoots.
2.Multiplication (1 cycle takes approx. 1 month): Each month, the tissue is subdivided and cultured.
How often the tissue is subdivided and into how many shoot pieces depends on the tissue culture
laboratory and banana cultivar, but with more multiplication cycles and shoots, the greater the
number of plants generated.
3.Rooting: Further to the multiplication cycles, shoots are placed on rooting media for about 1
month where they are induced to form roots and produce banana plantlets.
Nursery operators then take the fragile plantlets and put them through weaning and hardening,
before they are ready for selling to farmers:
4.Weaning (approx. 3 weeks): During this critical stage, plantlets are removed from and gradually
weaned from the conditions within a tissue culture flask (100% relative humidity, sterile and no
direct sunlight) to the environment of the shadehouse; weaning is usually accomplished using
humidity chambers within the shadehouse.
5.Hardening (1â€“3 months, until sale to farmers): During this stage, weaned plants are exposed to
the environment in the shadehouse which prepares them for field conditions.
Finally, farmers buy and grow the tissue culture plantlets, in much the same way as banana plants
derived from suckers or corm pieces.

Purpose: To reach as many potential participants as possible, provide them with information about
the training course and the first training session, and elicit feedback on likely attendance at the first
session. Potential participants include smallholder and commercial banana farmers, farmers who are
planning to start banana production, people who are selling banana tissue culture plantlets as a
business and those who intend to venture into this business.
Personnel: A facilitator and an assistant (training team)
Supplies: Mobile phone, transport, computer(s), printer, recording material (pens, notebooks)
Time: Begin 2 weeks ahead of the intended date for the training session
Tasks
1. Prepare flyers for distribution to potential participants
2. Identify and contact key people who may help with reaching potential participants
3. Approach and provide information to potential participants, and collect feedback on the
likelihood of them attending the training session
4. Follow-up with potential participants who showed interest, to remind them about the training
session.

1. Prepare flyers
Flyers are intended to inform potential participants and stimulate their interest to attend the first
training session. They should include the title of the training course (Training course for banana
farmers interested in growing tissue culture bananas); the venue, date and time for the first training
session (see Module 1); and a phone number for further information. The flyer should ideally be a
single page, should be visually attractive, and should be produced in the relevant language or
languages (Appendix 1).

2. Identify and contact key people
Key people who can help link the training team to potential participants include agricultural
extension workers, banana tissue culture nursery operators, agriculture-related organizations such
as NGOs, and influential people in the area such as religious leaders, businessmen, local council
leaders and traditional leaders. Explain to the key people, either in a joint meeting or individually,
the objectives of the training course and seek their help in reaching potential participants. This help
could be passing on the flyers to potential participants, or providing names and contact information
of potential participants.

3. Approach and provide information to potential participants, and collect feedback on the
likelihood of them attending the training session
Distributing the flyers is an essential way to reach and inform potential participants. The training
team may distribute the flyers themselves, ask the key contacts to distribute them, or share the task.
If the key contacts are helping with distribution, the training team should provide practical
assistance such as transport or fuel, mobile phone credit, books, pens and folders.

3

While distributing flyers, try to capture and record relevant information about the recipients, i.e.
name, phone number, date of receiving the flyer, and whether they expect to attend the training
session. This information will help to plan the training session. Use a feedback form to collect this
information (Appendix 2). If key contacts are helping with distribution, provide them with feedback
forms and ask them to try and collect the same information.
Other ways to reach potential participants include radio announcements, and displaying flyers in
communal places such as marketplaces.

4. Follow up with potential participants to remind them about the training session
About 5 days before the training session, contact (by phone or visit) all the potential participants
who showed interest in the training session and remind them of the date, time and venue for the
session.

Time: 3 hours

1. The training team should arrive at the venue at least 1 hour before the meeting to prepare the
room and equipment for the session. As participants arrive, welcome them, show them where to
sit and make them feel comfortable. Ask them to register using the attendance form. Provide
them with any training materials and supplies they need for the session.
2. Begin the training session. Welcome the participants and have each member of the training team
introduce him or herself to the participants, including their name, the organization they work for,
and their role on the training course. Then have the participants introduce themselves, including
their name, where they live, how they got to know about the meeting and their expectations
from the meeting.
3. Introduce the objectives of the training course. Briefly summarize the five modules that comprise
the course. Then introduce Module 1 and its objectives.
4. Give a detailed presentation about tissue culture bananas. Make the presentation as practical as
possible, using demonstrations as appropriate. Encourage questions or comments from the
participants throughout. The presentation can be based on the content on pages 6â€“12, and
structured as follows:
 What is banana tissue culture?
 How to produce banana tissue culture plantlets
 Soil sterilization
 Removing plantlets from laboratory culture containers and potting them into soil
 The humidity chamber
 The hardening process

 Where to obtain tissue culture banana plantlets
 Advantages and disadvantages of tissue culture banana plants
 Some myths about tissue culture banana plants.
5. The participants and training team discuss and agree the dates, time and venue for the
subsequent training sessions.
6. Carry out a baseline survey of participants. Useful information to gather includes: size of banana
plantation owned; number of banana plants and cultivars grown; past experience with banana
tissue culture plants; experience in banana production; challenges encountered with banana
production; average yields; and marketing channels for banana produced by the farmer. Use the
checklist in Appendix 5 to obtain this information (this may need to be translated into an
appropriate language.) Ask farmers to take the checklists and return them during the next
meeting.
7. Wrap up the session as follows:
 Briefly recap the dayâ€™s session
 Ensure that all participants have registered their names on the attendance list
 Communicate the topic for the next training session (Working in groups) and remind
participants of the date, time and venue.

What is banana tissue culture?
Tissue culture is a technique for multiplying clean banana planting material from small plant pieces
taken from a mother plant. Although any part of the banana plant can be used to generate tissue
culture plants, it is the meristem/shoot tip that is commonly used.
How to produce tissue culture banana plantlets
[Trainer: Demonstrate steps 1â€“6, then present steps 7â€“10 theoretically, in simple language.]
1. Carefully select source materials (peepers or small sword suckers) that appear healthy (pest- and
disease-free) and that are growing vigorously. [Trainer: Show two suckers to the participants: one
that has visible evidence of pest or disease infestation and one that appears healthy. Explain that
you cannot be sure if you are planting infected or clean material, as most suckers appear to be
relatively healthy until their corms are exposed.]
2. Using either a hoe or a panga, separate the sucker (â€˜ex-plantâ€™) from the mother plant.
3. Clean the sucker by removing soil and cutting off the roots to expose the corm. Cut off parts of
the pseudostem to a length of about 30 cm.

7

Fig. 1. Removing the outer leaf sheath from a sucker.

4. Pack the pseudostem parts in a clean nylon bag and transport them to a cleaner environment for
further manipulation.
5. Wash the sucker under tap water to remove mud and other debris.
6. Trim away the outer leaf sheaths, leaf bases and corm tissue of the ex-plant until a 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 cm3
cube enclosing the shoot apex remains. Be careful to avoid cutting through the apex.
7. The ex-plant is placed directly on a multiplication-inducing culture medium in containers. A
growth regulator (cytokinin) is added to the multiplication medium to speed up the process. The
containers are transferred to incubators or growth chambers and maintained at an optimal
growth temperature of 28 Â± 2Â°C.
8. Banana tissue culture shoots often suffer from blackening caused by exudates from wounded
tissues. These undesirable exudates form a barrier round the tissue, preventing nutrient uptake
and hindering growth. To prevent this, during the first 4â€“6 weeks fresh shoots are transferred to
new medium every 1â€“2 weeks.
9. The shoot tips then start to develop.
10.Individual shoots or shoot clumps that have formed are transferred to a nutrient medium which
does not promote further shoot proliferation but stimulates root formation (rooting media). After
rooting, plantlets are ready to leave the laboratory for weaning and hardening.
[Trainer: Show the participants a culture bottle with plantlets that are ready to leave the laboratory
for weaning. Briefly describe the remaining process the tissue culture plantlets have to go through
before they are ready for planting: after leaving the laboratory, the tissue culture plantlets are
removed from their culture containers, placed into small bags containing sterilized soil, and
transferred to a humidity chamber for weaning.]
Soil sterilization
Soil sterilization destroys plant pathogens, pests and weeds which may be present in the soil.
1. Prepare the necessary materials: oil drum, water, fireplace and firewood, forest soil, sand,
manure, hoes, spade, wheelbarrow and sisal bags.

8

Fig. 2. Preparing ex-plants prior to the initiation stage for tissue culture plantlets in the laboratory.

2. Ensure the drum has no holes. Weld some strong metal pipes inside the drum, horizontally and
approximately 30 cm from the bottom of the drum, to make a shelf for the soil sacks so that the
soil sacks are kept above the water.
3. Pour water into the drum up to approximately 25 cm from the bottom of the drum. The water
should not touch the metal pipes.
4. Thoroughly mix the forest soil, the manure and the sand in the right proportions. Note that
different nurseries use different proportions; the most common are: 5:2:1, 2:1:1 or 4:2:1 for
forest soil:manure:sand.
5. Pack about 10 kg of the mixture into sisal sacks and lift them into the drum so that they sit on
the metal pipes. When the drum is full, cover the top of the drum with sisal bags so that steam is
retained when the drum is heated.

6. Proper sterilization of the soil depends on the amount of firewood used and the intensity of the
fire. Generally, after 1â€“2 hours of a large enough fire, when steam is seen coming out of the soil,
the soil should be fully sterilized.
7. When the soil is considered fully sterilized, remove the covering sisal bags and leave the drum to
cool. After cooling, remove the sisal bags containing the soil mixture and pour the soil onto a
clean surface, spreading it out to cool. It may take 2â€“3 hours, or overnight, before the soil cools
completely and is ready to use.
Removing plantlets from laboratory culture containers and potting them into soil
1. After removing the plantlets from the culture bottles, rinse their roots to remove agar residue
which could encourage development of pathogens. If the plantlet has long roots, shorten them
to about 2â€“3 cm, since long roots may break and take more time to establish.
2. Plantlets coming out of the culture bottles are not of uniform size and may be clumped.
Carefully separate any that are clumped, and sort them according to size.
3. Pot plants of the same size into small plastic containers (~150 ml) containing sterilized soil
mixture. Up to five plantlets of the same size can be potted into one plastic container.

Fig. 4. Plantlets ready for weaning in the humidity chamber after being removed from tissue
culture laboratory containers.

The weaning process (humidity chamber)
The fragile plantlets are weaned in a humidity chamber, which helps them adapt to the external
environment. While in the culture bottles, plantlets are under 100% relative humidity and lower light
intensities. In the humidity chamber, they experience lower humidity and higher light levels, getting
them used to conditions in the field.

10

Fig. 5. A shadehouse with a humidity chamber for weaning tissue culture plantlets.

The following conditions are recommended in the humidity chamber:

Temperature should be between 25C and 35C. Lower or higher temperatures can lead to poor
plant development.

Keep plantlets shaded. Shades can be constructed using sheeted bamboo poles, grass or leaves
and placed on the roof of the humidity chamber. The chamber itself can be kept in the
shadehouse or under natural shade (e.g. a tree).

High relative humidity should be maintained by regular misting using a hand sprayer. Humidity
can be gradually reduced over time.
The hardening process (shadehouse)
Plants should be transplanted into containers or black polythene bags either directly after removal
from tissue culture flasks or following 1â€“2 weeks growth in a humidity chamber.
Procedure for transferring the plantlets to a shadehouse for hardening:

Fill the polythene bags (~ 250â€“350 ml) or containers with a soil mixture and pour some water
into the polythene bags.

Carefully uproot the plantlets (coming from the humidity chamber) from their container, one at
a time.

Using your index finger or a rod, make an insertion into the moist soil within the polythene bag
and carefully insert the uprooted plantlet in an upright position. Plant only one plantlet per bag
or container. Cover its entire corm with the potting mix.

Transfer the potted plantlet into the shadehouse for hardening. After about a month in the
shadehouse, the plantlets are ready for planting in the soil.

11

The following conditions are recommended in the shadehouse:

Daily watering, either in the morning or in the evening; twice a day (morning and evening)
during very dry conditions.

Temperature between 15C and 35C, with an optimum of 25â€“30C.

A high standard of hygiene is necessary to reduce the risk of damage by pest or pathogens.
Caterpillars and mites can be serious leaf pests in the nursery. Spraying plants with insecticides
can be effective for the control of such pests.

Partial shading is essential especially during the early stages in the shadehouse. Shade can be
provided by using a special shadenet to cover the shadehouse.

Where to obtain tissue culture banana plantlets
Production of tissue culture plantlets takes place at specialized laboratories (see table on page viii).
Plantlets can be procured at different levels of maturity (post-flask, post-weaning or post-hardening)
and through different channels (directly from the laboratory, at a tissue culture banana nursery or
from tissue culture banana distributors). Farmers would most likely buy post-hardened plantlets
from a nursery or a distributor.

Advantages and disadvantages of tissue culture banana plants

Advantages
Disadvantages

Disease- and pest- free planting material

Little space needed for multiplying large
numbers of plants

Uniform plantlets which provide for
consistent plantation development

More vigorous plants, with shorter harvest-
to-harvest periods and higher bunch
weights

Prerequisite for cross-border traffic of
planting material

Allows for faster distribution of superior
germplasm

Can be used in gene banks to conserve
plant genotypes for future use in research
or agriculture

Price of tissue culture planting material is
usually double that of conventional sucker
material

Better plant management and care is needed
(watering, weeding and adding fertilizer),
especially at early stages

Plantlets are easily infected with pests and
diseases if transplanted in pest- and pathogen-
infested soils

The number of different cultivars produced
and sold by the laboratories may be limited,
reducing genetic diversity in the planting
material market

Some myths about tissue culture banana plants
MYTH: Tissue culture banana plants cannot be attacked by any pests or diseases.
FACT: Tissue culture banana plants, just like an ordinary sucker, are susceptible to pest and disease
attack. They are, however, free from pests and diseases when they are planted out (apart from
viruses and some types of bacteria).

MYTH: Tissue culture bananas are flowers.
FACT: Tissue culture banana plants are not flowers. However, before being established in the field,
they resemble a flower called Strelitzia spp.

MYTH: Suckers from tissue culture banana plants are also tissue culture plants.
FACT: Suckers from tissue culture plants are ordinary suckers just like the ones from ordinary banana
plants.

MYTH: Tissue culture is a variety/cultivar.
FACT: Suckers from tissue culture plants are ordinary suckers just like the ones from ordinary banana
plants. Tissue culture plants are not a variety/cultivar. They are the usual banana plants that nursery
operators have always planted except that they can be rapidly multiplied in the bio-technology
laboratory.

&				
Q1: How does one become a nursery operator?
A1: We are running a parallel training with prospective tissue culture banana nursery operators and
anyone can join. Give us your telephone contact and we will let you know when the training is
happening.
Q2: What is IITA in full?
A2: IITA is the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture. It is an agricultural research
organization with its headquarters in Ibadan, Nigeria, and stations in Benin, Cameroon, DR Congo,
Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda.
Q3: Can IITA or VEDCO subsidize people who want to start tissue culture nurseries?
A3: No. However IITA/VEDCO can equip interested people with the relevant skills and knowledge,
and this is free. The training includes a module on financing for tissue culture nursery operators,
which will help mobilize finances for running a tissue culture nursery.
Q4: Is it okay to establish a banana orchard using suckers derived from tissue culture plants?
A4: Yes, it is ok and there are several people who sell suckers from orchards that were started using
tissue culture plants. However, suckers derived from tissue culture plants are just like any other
suckers, and not pest- and disease-free.
Q5: How long do tissue culture plants take to mature and fruit?
A5: If a tissue culture plant is managed very well, it will always fruit and mature faster than an
ordinary sucker. Usually, this takes 9â€“12 months after planting.
Q6: Do tissue culture plants require special management techniques compared to conventional
banana plants?
A6: Tissue culture plants, just like ordinary suckers, require good management if you want to have
optimal yields. However, especially just after field transplanting, tissue culture plantlets need extra
attention.
Q7: Several technologies exist to treat suckers. Are treated suckers as clean as tissue culture plants?
A7: There are two types of sucker treatments: hot water treatment and solar energy treatment. Hot
water treatment involves submerging a sucker into hot water (50â€“55C) for 30 minutes or,
alternatively, in boiling water for 10 seconds. Solar energy treatment uses solar radiation. Before
both treatments, however, the suckers are pared to a depth of half a centimeter to remove all the
roots and nematode lesions. Both procedures are especially useful for killing banana-parasitic
nematodes and banana weevils, but they do not remove all banana diseases. Tissue culture plants,
on the other hand, do not contain pests and diseases (with the exception of viruses and some types
of bacteria).

14

Q8: I was told that tissue culture plants have a shorter production cycle. Why is this?
A8: Tissue culture-derived planting material is in general more vigorous than conventional planting
material. Also, because tissue culture plants are pest- and disease-free at the time of planting, they
are less stressed and can grow faster than conventional planting material.
Q9: What are the challenges associated with tissue culture banana plants?
A9: The price of a tissue culture plantlet is usually double compared to a conventional sucker. Also,
better management and care of the plants is required, especially at the early stages. Otherwise,
growing tissue culture banana plants has no special challenges compared with ordinary banana
plants.
Q10: If I looked after my suckers very well, possibly after a rigorous sucker treatment process, wonâ€™t
they yield the same as tissue culture plants?
A10: Sucker treatment reduces the levels of nematode and banana weevil infections in a sucker, but
it does not kill all the other banana diseases. So if your sucker contains any diseases, it will not have
the same yield as a tissue culture plant under the same conditions. Also, tissue culture plants are
more vigorous than suckers, treated or not.
Q11: Is it true that suckers from tissue culture plants take longer to establish in the garden and also
perform poorly?
A11: Suckers from tissue culture plants are just like any other sucker from conventional plants and
should behave the same way when planted.
Q12: Why is the price of tissue culture banana plants so high?
A12: The price reflects the cost of the inputs used to raise the plantlets.

The objective of this module is to familiarize participants with ways in which people can come
together, form a group, and work productively for a common purpose.


The module is comprised of the following sessions:
 Session 1: Introduction to working in groups
 Session 2: Who should join the group?
 Session 3: Group leadership
 Session 4: Group motivation
 Session 5: Communication within the group
 Session 6: Solving conflicts within the group
 Session 7: Making a group constitution
Sessions 1â€“6 can each be carried out in a single training session, while Session 7 is scheduled to take
8 hours and should be carried out in three separate sessions on different days. The entire module
should take about 4 months to complete (2â€“3 sessions/month).
All sessions should be held in a convenient classroom or other meeting place.

Write the topic of the day (Introduction to working in groups), and the questions that will guide the
session, on the flipchart ahead of the training. The questions are:
 What is a group?
 What are the benefits of working as a group?
 What are the factors contributing to group success?
 What are the causes of group failure?

			
1. Open the dayâ€™s session by displaying the flipchart with the title of the dayâ€™s session and the
questions guiding the session.
2. Invite participants to brainstorm on what the word â€˜groupâ€™ means. List their responses on the
flipchart. Based on participantsâ€™ input, extract a definition of â€˜groupâ€™ that includes at least the
following elements:
 People rather than things
 Size, i.e. two or more persons
 Purpose â€“ members have a common goal or goals
 Interaction, i.e. members interact to pursue the goal of the group.
Write the definition on the flipchart and display prominently. Ask the participants to use this
definition to identify types of groups that exist in their community. Give participants a few
minutes to think about this.
3.
To demonstrate the benefits of working as a group, invite four participants to come to the front
of the training hall to take part in a game. Place a glass of water in front of each of the four
participants, and ask them to lift the glass off the table using only their index finger. When they
cannot do this individually, suggest that they work together. If all four use their index fingers at
the same time to lift one glass they will be successful. Ask participants what this demonstration
shows about the advantages of working as a group. Are there other advantages to working as a
group? Write responses on the flipchart.
4.
For the other two questions guiding the dayâ€™s session, divide participants into groups of about
five and let each group brainstorm on the questions. Allow groups about 20â€“30 minutes to
come up with answers. Call back the groups and let a spokesperson from each group present
the answers to the class. Encourage participants to provide examples where appropriate.
Where necessary, supplement the discussion.

Wrap up the training session as follows:
 Briefly recap the dayâ€™s session
 Communicate the topic of the next session (Who should join the group?), and the date, time
and venue (ideally the venue will be the same for all the sessions).


Definition of a group
A group is a collection of individuals who have regular contact and frequent interaction, and who
work together to achieve a common goal or goals.
A farmer group is a collection of farmers with a common objective or problem to solve, which is
often associated with the production and marketing of agricultural products.
Benefits of working in a group
Benefits include:
 Groups of farmers can get access to services such as advisory services, technology, credit,
markets and information, which individual farmers, particularly the disadvantaged (poor, women
and youth), may not be able to.
 Collective production, marketing and purchase of inputs can offer economies of scale and
therefore reduce costs for farmers.
 Farmer groups provide a forum to share experiences and learn from one another.
 Group pressure tends to stimulate adoption of knowledge and change to improved practices.
 Increases farmersâ€™ opportunities for participation in development programmes.
 Promotes inter-personal relationships and collaboration.
 Encourages better management of shared resources.
 A farmer group can act as security for loans (group guarantee).
 Gives farmers a â€˜voiceâ€™, which they may use to influence policy.
Characteristics of successful farmer groups
A successful famer group:
 has a clear goal, objectives and action plan
 has a constitution, or a written record of its purpose and rules, which are observed by all
members
 has good leaders, elected by the members
 has a name and a physical address
 keeps proper records for transparency
 has members make financial contributions and encourage group savings, which helps build a
sense of ownership

24

 has honest members who work hard to achieve their shared objectives
 holds regular meetings and takes minutes
 has members participate in decision making, and share the benefits.
Causes of group failure
 Some or all of the characteristics above are lacking
 Cliques/factions develop in the group
 Unresolved conflicts/problems in the group.

&				
Q1: Is our farmersâ€™ group eligible for a bank loan?
A1: Your group is eligible for a loan from a bank that offers agricultural loans, as long as the group
meets the minimum requirements for borrowing, which differ from bank to bank. Banks normally
lend money to people in groups because group members can act as guarantors for the loan.
Q2: What should be the maximum number of individuals in a farmersâ€™ group?
A2: There is no maximum number, but the bigger the size of the group, the harder it becomes to
manage. A total of 50 members may be ideal, but with good management a larger group could be
successful.
Q3: Many non-government organizations in this area seem to prefer working with womenâ€™s groups.
Why is this?
A3: Women play a key role in agricultural development and ensure food security at a household
level, and yet in most communities they donâ€™t make key decision regarding agricultural production
or marketing, which are instead left to men. For this reason, many NGOs are prioritizing working
with womenâ€™s groups to increase the capacity of women in making key agricultural decisions.
Q4: In the past, we tried to form groups but they didnâ€™t last. How can we make sure new groups will
be successful?
A4: If you ensure that your group has the characteristics of successful farmersâ€™ groups (see above),
then it should be successful.
Q5: Can a farmersâ€™ group do things outside farming?
A5: Yes, a farmersâ€™ group can do things outside farming as long as they are in line with the group
vision and objectives and all members are in agreement over the new developments.

and agree some responses to the questions. Allow about 30 minutes for the group work, then
assemble all groups and let a spokesperson from each group share the groupâ€™s responses in the
plenary. List the points on the flipchart.
4. Wrap up the training session as follows:


Who should be invited to join the group?

People who share common goals, and are committed to reaching the goals.

People who share common interests. Similar interests and a good understanding of each other
contribute to a successful group.

People who are motivated and interested in becoming members of the group. No one should be
forced to join.

26

Should the group include both women and men?
The gender composition of the group is important, both for the internal workings of the group
(group dynamics), and for achieving the goals of the group. When forming a gender-balanced group,
the group should strive for things such as equal participation in decision-making structures and
processes, equal opportunities, and equal access to information.
Should the group include people of different classes or ethnic groups?
There are rich, poor, middle class, and different ethnic groups within most communities. Whether to
include a range of classes and ethnic groups will depend on the goals of the group and on practical
considerations. There can be advantages to mixed groups, for example the group may benefit from a
wider perspective. However, if too many members are from rich and elite communities, they may
dominate the decision-making processes.
What size should the group be?
A large group size can be unmanageable. Also, it can be difficult for all members to meet frequently,
and resources may be insufficient. However, with good management in place, a large group can
function effectively.
From how far away should members be recruited?
If group members are far away from each other, meetings will be difficult. Groups consisting of
individuals living in the same location or village, or nearby villages, are usually more effective.

&				
Q1: Can people become members of more than one group?
A1: Joining more than one group may mean that the person cannot devote enough time to either
group. It is probably better to decide which the most appropriate group is and stay with that one.
Q2: Should members of a group all be from the same village?
A2: There are benefits if members are living close to each other, for example it is easier to meet.
However, groups can also have members from nearby villages.
Q3: How long should a person be living in an area before they are eligible to join a group?
Q3: This will depend on the group constitution, but 1 year would be a good length of time, so that
the person has got to know the community.
Q4: How often should a group hold meetings?
A4: A group should probably meet at least two times a month, but this will also depend on the
nature of the group.

Leadership
Leadership is the art of motivating other people towards achieving a common goal. Group leadership
involves facilitating the achievement of group goals and objectives, and motivating members to
pursue group goals.
Roles of a leader

Create an environment of trust, open communication, creative thinking, and cohesive team
effort

Provide the team with a vision

Motivate and inspire team members

Lead by setting a good example (role model)

Coach and help team members

Facilitate problem solving and collaboration

Strive for team consensus

Ensure discussions and decisions lead to closure

Maintain healthy group dynamics

Intervene when necessary to aid the group in resolving issues

Assure that the group members have the necessary education and training to effectively
participate

Encourage creativity, entrepreneurship and ongoing improvement

Recognize and celebrate group and group member accomplishments and exceptional
performance.
Types of leadership
Autocratic leadership
Autocratic leadership is where a leader exerts high levels of power over his or her employees or
team members. People within the team are given few opportunities for making suggestions, even if
these would be in the teamâ€™s or organizationâ€™s interest.
Bureaucratic leadership
Bureaucratic leaders work â€˜by the bookâ€™, ensuring that their staff follow procedures exactly. This is a
very appropriate style for work involving serious safety risks (such as working with machinery, with
toxic substances or at heights) or where large sums of money are involved (such as cash-handling).
Charismatic leadership
A charismatic leadership style is one where the leader injects a lot of enthusiasm into his or her
team, and is very energetic in driving others forward. However, a charismatic leader can tend to
believe more in him- or herself than in the group. This creates a risk that the entire organization
might collapse if the leader were to leave, because their followers believe that success is tied to the
presence of the charismatic leader. As such, charismatic leadership carries great responsibility, and
needs long-term commitment from the leader.

29

Democratic or participative leadership
Although a democratic leader will make the final decision, he or she invites other members of the
team to contribute to the decision-making process. This not only increases job satisfaction by
involving employees or team members in whatâ€™s going on, but it also helps to develop peopleâ€™s skills.
Employees and team members feel in control of their own destiny, and so are motivated to work
hard by more than just a financial reward.
Laissez-faire leadership
This French phrase means â€˜leave it beâ€™ and is used to describe a leader who leaves his or her
colleagues to get on with their work. It can be effective if the leader monitors what is being achieved
and communicates this back to his or her team regularly. Most often, laissez-faire leadership works
for teams in which the individuals are experienced and skilled self-starters.
Qualities of a good leader
A good leader:

is gender sensitive

acts with self-confidence, avoids anger, and takes decisions on a rational and informed basis

is able to admit his or her weaknesses

is willing to delegate responsibility

has a good understanding of human behaviour

respects and accommodates the needs of others

motivates others toward the attainment of the organizational goals

has personal motivation, that is, the enthusiasm to complete a task

has good communication skills

is able to manage conflicts within the organization.

Q1: At what age can someone be considered for a leadership position in a group?
A1: The age that is legally recognized is 18 years and above.
Q2: How many leadership positions should a group have?
A2: It depends on the size of the group, but normally a group should have at least five leadership
positions: chairperson, vice chairperson, secretary, mobilizer and treasurer.
Q3: How often should group leadership be changed?
A3: This varies from group to group, but leaders should hold their positions for at least a year.
Q4: Can one person hold more than one leadership position within a group?
A4: No, ideally one person should not hold more than one leadership position.
Q5: People say the position of treasurer is for women. Is this correct?
A5: No, a man or a woman can hold the position of treasurer. However, most communities tend to
agree that women might be more trustworthy with money.
Q6: Should the leadership positions be held by educated people?
A6: This depends on the interests and goals of the group, but it is probably better if the leaders can
write and read.

Motivation
Motivation is an inner state that drives someone to do something. Motivation includes desires,
wants, drives, motives and incentives to do something.
Motivating others involves creating conditions where people are willing to work with initiative,
interest and enthusiasm, and with a sense of responsibility, loyalty and discipline, so that the goals
of an organization are achieved effectively. Motivation is one of the most important factors for
managing human resources within family, groups or organizations.
Understanding motivation will help:
 To ensure active participation
 To maximize utilization of human capacity
 To build self-reliant development
 To build accountability for successful performance
 To be inclusive.
Motivational techniques
What is it that motivates individuals to work with initiative and enthusiasm in pursuit of a common
goal? There is no single answer to this question, as different things motivate different people. Some
people are motivated by money or other material rewards, some are motivated by the recognition
and praise of others, some are entirely self-motivated by individual standards and goals they have
set, some are motivated by the fear of failure, and so on. People may be highly motivated if they are
actively involved in activities, such as problem analyses, programme design, implementation, etc.
Equality in a group, as well as trust and safety, are important prerequisites to motivation.
Motivators include:
 Rewards such as
â€“ money
â€“ prizes
â€“ recognition and respect from others
â€“ praise
â€“ love and friendship
 Job/work motivators
â€“ assignments that are interesting and sufficiently challenging
â€“ being given opportunities to learn and gain skills
â€“ being recognized and respected by colleagues
 Internal motivators
â€“ desire and belief that one can improve oneâ€™s life (setting and reaching individual goals)
â€“ self-satisfaction from meeting individual goals

33

â€“ self-satisfaction for work well done
â€“ self-satisfaction from working with others
â€“ self-respect
 Negative motivators
â€“ fear of failure
â€“ threat of punishment
â€“ threat of withdrawal of recognition and respect.

&				
Q1: How does a group stay motivated when it suffers a setback?
A1: All group members need to know that setbacks need not be the end. Theyâ€™re just a little stone
on the road. It is important for group members to work together to stay motivated in the event of a
setback, and stay focused on achieving the group goals.
Q2: If a leader seems to be losing interest in the group, what can we do?
A2: When a leader in the group loses motivation to continue group work, the management of the
group should try to seek the reasons for the situation and encourage him or her to continue with the
work (providing a supporting environment). If this fails, the management may decide to relieve the
person of his or her duties.
Q3: How can group members be motivated to attend meetings regularly?
A3: There is no single way to motivate people. The group management could speak with the people
concerned to find out why they are not attending meetings regularly. They could try to encourage
them by reminding them of the groupâ€™s goals and objectives. But if members continue to miss
meetings, they could earn penalties as stipulated in the groupâ€™s constitution.


Communication within a group
Communication means passing on information from one person to another. Effective
communication is needed so that members of the group and employees understand the groupâ€™s
objectives and their roles in the group, and feel they are able to contribute and belong to the group.
Effective communication within a group is also an important aspect of motivating employees.
Types of communication
Formal communications are part of the organized communication system, and relate to the
operations of the group. Many groups have a formal communication system that indicates who will
report to whom, who will inform whom about what, the form in which messages will be sent (e.g.
written, oral), how messages will be stored (e.g. filing system) and so on.
Informal communications are casual and based on social interactions among people who work and
live together. Informal communications are not bound by group policy. Informal communications
can both help and hinder formal communications. Information can be passed on quickly through
informal channels, bypassing layers of hierarchy. But informal communication has a greater chance
of being distorted, so it can also hinder formal communication.
Barriers to effective communication
There are many things that can interfere with the communication process. These barriers can be
physical, cultural, social or personal, and are often interrelated. Examples of barriers include:
 Physical barriers: these may be geographic barriers such as distance, weather disturbances or
mountain ranges; or weaknesses or problems with the mechanisms that are used for
communication, e.g. poor telephone lines, computer systems being down, or poor postal
services.
 Group barriers: communications can be impeded by complex group structures, complex
communication systems, conflict, different personal goals or ambitions, or lack of cooperation
within groups.
 Socio-economic and personal barriers: communications can be impeded when the people
involved come from different social classes, economic backgrounds, language groups, educational
levels, occupations, or geographic locations. Communications are also influenced by peopleâ€™s
attitudes to one another, perceptions about one another, their personal ambitions, and
ideological beliefs. For example, individuals who dislike each other or are hostile to one another
may have difficulty communicating.
 Gender: in many situations women are less able to communicate than men. Women are less
empowered and participate less in decision-making processes. They are less confident than men
about speaking out, asking for information, and expressing their views. As a result women are not
always able to communicate fully and contribute equally in an organization.

36

 Poor communication skills: lack of communication skills, such as speaking, writing and listening
skills, can present a barrier to effective communication.
 Lack of trust: one of the barriers to communication is lack of trust. When people first meet and
donâ€™t know each other well, they are often cautious about disclosing too much information. As
they get to know each other and develop trust, their communications become more open.

&				
Q1: How can a group overcome a problem of communication barrier?
A1: The group should first identify the type of communication barrier, and then come up with
appropriate solutions to address it. For example, if the barrier to communication is identified as lack
of trust within the group, this could be solved if group members took some time to get to know each
other better so that they can trust each other.
Q2: Is it good practice for all group members to contact the chairperson every time they have an
issue/problem they want to be addressed?
A2: Each group has its own communication system or structure. For some groups all issues have to
be addressed by the chairperson, while for other groups different officers handle different sorts of
issues/problems.
Q3: If a group member is illiterate and cannot read or write, how best can they be helped in
instances that require written communication?
A3: It is good practice to identify limitations of group members at an early stage during group
formation. If some members are unable to read or write, the group management should devise ways
of helping them, for example pairing them with members who can read and write, or limiting the
tasks that require reading and writing.

Why conflicts arise
People have their own values and opinions that they consider important. Conflicts arise when others
have different values and opinions. Conflicts may arise between individual people, between groups
of people, within organizations or between organizations.
Conflict is not necessarily negative. Conflict can help build institutional capacity, and generate
creative ideas. Tension from well-managed conflict can lead to change (in fact, conflict, or tension, is
an essential component of change). However, if conflict is not properly managed, it can create
harmful events.
Examples of causes of group conflict include:
 Lack of resources
 Differences of opinion
 Lack of respect for othersâ€™ ideas
 Personal egos of some members leading to them dominating the group
 Personal ambitions and goals out of line with group goals
 Gender discrimination
 Poor communication systems within the organization
 Failure of the organization to meet its intended goals.
Conflict management
There are many ways of managing conflict. Some of these are:
 Avoid
 Accommodate: the conflicting parties express their opinions, but do not change these
 Dominate: the conflicting parties attempt to dominate each other
 Compromise: one or both parties compromise, i.e. change their position
 Collaborate: the conflicting parties collaborate to arrive at a mutually agreeable solution.

&				
Q1: If a group member threatens to leave the group due to a conflict with another member, how
should the group deal with this?
A1: Groups should have by-laws in place stipulating ways of resolving conflict within the group. If a
member threatens to leave, the group leadership should talk to the person to understand the
problem. The leadership should then try to resolve the conflict so that the member agrees to stay.
Q2: Do all group conflicts end with members making up?
A2: No, in the real world this does not always happen. Some conflicts may even end in violence.
However, groups should always do everything in their powers to resolve conflicts peacefully.
Q3: If a conflict arises where group members suspect the leadership is misusing group resources
(such as money), how should the group handle this?
A3: Firstly, at the inception of the group, members should emphasize transparency in the way the
group leadership carries out its activities, and this includes the handling of group finances. However,
where the leadership is suspected of misusing group finances, the group should summon the
leadership and have them transparently declare the group accounts to the plenary. When misuse of
finances is identified, the group should agree on a penalty for the people involved. This could be
confiscating the property of the people involved until the group finances are recovered, or in
extreme cases, calling in the police.

What is a constitution?
A constitution is a document that sets out the laws and principles that govern a group of people such
as a farmersâ€™ group, an association or a nation. A constitution is a requirement before a group can be
formally registered as a legal entity.
Contents of a constitution
Contents of the constitution can be basic or complex. They should include:
 The name of the group/organization/company
 Definition of terms, titles and phrases used
 Physical location of the group
 Affiliation to other bodies or groups

41

 The objectives of the group/association and its major intended activities
 Membership composition and criteria for admitting new members
 Administrative structure, e.g. board of directors, committees, etc.
 Financial year
 Methods and authority of purchasing, caring for and disposal of group properties
 Bank signatories and authorization on group bank documentation
 Duties, powers and privileges of the management committee, members, etc.
 By-laws, and procedure for their origination, adaptation and application
 Language of business and meetings
 Scope and amendment of constitution
 Interpretation and resolution of disputes.

Q1: Whose role is it to make a constitution?
A1: The entire group takes responsibility to develop its own constitution.
Q2: Can the group hire someone to draw up its constitution?
A2: Yes, a lawyer could be hired, but the group must takes responsibility for explaining to the lawyer
what they need in terms of the content.
Q3: How often should we amend the constitution to accommodate changes?
A3: The group can amend the constitution any time there is need, but this should not be misused,
and the entire group should agree on the need to amend.
Q4: If someone refuses to respect the constitution, what can be done?
A4: If a group member refuses to respect the group constitution, he or she should be dismissed from
the group.

The Community Development Centre is an NGO established several years ago in one of the districts
in Northern Uganda. Its objective is to improve the socioeconomic situation of poor and
marginalized women, men and children in rural communities. Until about a year and a half ago, the
organization ran smoothly with a good working environment. Members respected one another,
shared a strong organizational vision and held a sense of responsibility to meet that vision. Members
and staff were committed and energetic. However, gradually over the past year, the organization
has lost its good spirits and working environment. Now regular meetings among the members and
staff are not held, and the chairperson only meets with a few of his special friends in the
organization. He discusses organizational matters and programme issues with them, and does not
share information with others. Members are not aware of decisions taken or the activities of the
NGO. When members provide feedback or ideas, they are ignored and made to feel their
contribution is not important. Women feel that they are not able to contribute ideas because the
meetings are held at times when they cannot attend. When invitations are received by the NGO for
outside meetings or training, the chairperson and his close friends are the only ones able to
participate. The chairperson and his friends have taken control of the NGO, and hold all the rights
and responsibilities. Consequently, the membersâ€™ feeling of ownership and commitment to the
organization has declined. This has made the members feel much less motivated to volunteer for
work in the NGO, and the organization nearly disintegrated. Finally, the chairperson has become
aware of the depth of the problem in the organization and is trying to take action.

Objective
The objective of this module is to teach the participants good agronomic practices associated with
banana cultivation.

Structure
The module comprises the following sessions:
 Session 1: Introduction to growing bananas
 Session 2: Types of banana planting material, and how to prepare them for planting
 Session 3: Field preparation
 Session 4: Planting and initial care
 Session 5: Water and soil conservation
 Session 6: Use of organic and inorganic fertilizers
 Session 7: Weed control
 Session 8: Routine field management
 Session 9: Pest and disease management
 Session 10: Preparation for farm visits
 Session 11: Individual farm visits
The sessions should ideally be carried out over 4â€“5 months (two to three sessions per month). Each
of Sessions 1â€“8 and 10 can be carried out in a single meeting (2â€“3 hours). Session 9 takes 5â€“6 hours
and should be carried out as two 2â€“3 hour meetings on separate training days. Session 11 involves
the training team visiting all the participant farmersâ€™ fields, and the time and number of days will
depend on the size of the group being trained and the distance to be travelled to reach the fields.
Ideally Session 11 should be completed within 2 weeks.
Sessions 1 and 2 are held at a convenient classroom or other meeting place. Sessions 3â€“10 are held
in participant farmersâ€™ fields. These can be different for each session except for Sessions 3 and 4
which should be held in the same field. Session 11 is held in individual fields of participating farmers.

Importance of bananas
Plantain and banana are important staples and a source of income for the smallholders who grow
them in the humid forest and mid-altitude agro-ecologies of sub-Saharan Africa. Many families use
banana for food security purposes as well as an income-generating crop.

47

In addition, banana:
 provides soil surface cover
 reduces soil erosion on steep slopes
 is a good source of mulch for maintaining and improving soil fertility
 provides animal feed.
Types of banana grown in East Africa
1. Cooking bananas (matooke): mature bananas are harvested green, peeled, boiled (steamed) and
consumed. Examples of cultivars grown in Uganda include Kisansa, Mpologoma, Mudwale,
Namaliga, Atwalira and Mbwazirume.
2. Beer/juice bananas: mature plants are harvested, ripened and squeezed into juice. Examples of
cultivars grown in Uganda include Kisubi, Kabula, FHIA-1 and FHIA-25.
3. Dessert bananas: these bananas are eaten raw when ripe. Examples of cultivars grown in Uganda
include Bogoya, Ndizi, FHIA-17 and Cavendish.
4. Roasting bananas: these bananas are sweet, and are eaten roasted. Examples of cultivars grown
in Uganda include Manjaala and Katansense.
Agronomic practices needed for the establishment and management of a banana plantation
1. Banana field establishment:
â€“ site preparation (demarcation of the field, digging holes and manure application)
â€“ preparation of planting material
â€“ planting
â€“ management immediately after planting (according to type of planting material).
2. Water and soil conservation practices:
â€“ mulching
â€“ digging trenches
â€“ manure application (organic and inorganic fertilizers).
3. Plantation management practices:
â€“ weed control (cultural methods, herbicides)
â€“ de-suckering (helps match harvest with peak market season like Christmas and Easter)
â€“ staking or propping
â€“ removal of the male bud.
4. Pest and disease control
5. Harvesting

Banana planting materials
There are three main types of planting material.
1. Tissue culture plants: banana planting material grown in a clean environment in the laboratory
from small plant pieces taken from a mother plant. Tissue culture plants can be obtained from
various commercial producers and nurseries.
2. Suckers: shoots growing from the rhizome of banana plants which then grow into new plants.
Ideally suckers should come from a healthy, pest- and disease-free plantation.
3. Corm pieces: portions of the banana plant cut from the rhizome (corm) of the plant and with a
bud attached. Advantages of using corm pieces include:
â€“ relatively clean planting material
â€“ more planting material from fewer suckers
â€“ easy to transport
â€“ easy to treat for pest control.
Corm pieces should come from a healthy, pest- and disease-free plantation.
How to prepare different banana planting materials
1. Tissue culture plants: No major preparation is needed of tissue culture plants if they have been
kept in a clean environment prior to planting. However, if the plants are seen to have pest-
infested leaves or leaves in a bad condition, these should be cut off prior to planting.
2. Suckers: Uproot sword or maiden suckers from healthy, pest- and disease-free banana plants
using a hoe. Sword suckers (1.8â€“2.1 m high and ~4.5 cm in girth) are preferred, partly because
they are less infested with nematodes and banana weevils than larger planting material. Sucker
preparation should be done far from the new field. Remove all leaves, roots and all parts of the
rhizome that appear diseased (tunnels indicating banana weevils, reddish lesions at base
indicating nematodes, yellow-brown lesions indicating Armillaria root rot). The oldest leaf
sheaths should also be removed as they may house banana weevil eggs or adults. A slanting cut is
made to remove the top part (slanting prevents water from collecting on top, causing rotting).
Plant suckers within a week after uprooting.

Fig. 1. Preparing suckers for planting.

3. Corm pieces: Select suitable suckers (healthy, 1.8â€“2.1 m long and ~4.5 cm in girth). Separate the
corm from the stem of the sucker. Cut off the outer layers of the corm, about 3 cm deep, to
reduce nematode populations. Remove damaged parts and wash the corm with clean water. Cut
up the corm into 4â€“7 pieces depending on corm size and number of buds. Every piece should
contain a visible, healthy bud. Treat corm pieces with recommended insecticides before planting
(e.g. cypermethrin).

&				
Q1: How much does it cost to start a banana tissue culture production facility?
A1: The actual cost of starting a banana tissue culture production facility depends on the size of the
facility. It is however a costly venture that may require at least 50 million Ugandan shillings (1 US$ =
1,900 Ugsh on 1/1/10). This may explain why there are few such facilities in Uganda despite the high
demand for tissue culture plantlets.
Q2: For how long does a banana field established using banana tissue plantlets last?
A2: How long a banana plantation lasts depends on the level of management, and is the same
whether started with tissue culture plantlets or other planting material. A well-managed plantation
should last for a minimum of 10 years.
Q3: Are suckers from tissue culture plant also called tissue culture plants?
A3: No. When a tissue culture plantlet is planted into the field, all the suckers it produces thereafter
are not tissue culture plants, they are ordinary suckers.
Q4: Can all banana cultivars be produced using banana tissue culture technology?
A4: Yes, all banana cultivars can be produced using tissue culture technology. However, the
management of a tissue culture laboratory will first assess the commercial potential of a demanded
cultivar to ensure profits.
Q5: When you remove the roots and all the debris from the corm of a sucker, is the planting material
then free from all banana pests and diseases?
A5: No, removing roots and debris from a sucker cannot eliminate all pests and diseases that may be
affecting the sucker. However, many pests, such as nematodes or banana weevil eggs, are removed.

4. Have participants carry out the different steps for preparing the land before planting bananas.
They should start by demarcating a space in the field where the planting holes will be dug (the
land should have been freed of weeds ahead of the training session). During this step, discuss
with participants the advantages of properly demarcating the field before digging planting holes.
Advise participants of the various ways they could demarcate their fields before digging holes.
5. After demarcating the field, participants should dig planting holes where the bananas will be
planted. During this step, discuss the following:
 Size of the planting hole, and factors that dictate the size of the hole
 Methods of digging a planting hole
 The best time for digging planting holes
 Spacing between banana planting holes.


The farmer hosting the next session should agree to provide at least eight healthy looking
sword suckers, hoes, a panga, a knife, two jerry cans of water (20 liters each), manure (12
basins) and dry grass. The training team will provide four tissue culture plantlets.


Choosing a site for a banana plantation
 For good yields, bananas need a deep, well-drained loam soil with high humus content, ideally
volcanic or alluvial origin and with considerable amounts of nutrients.
 Very acidic soils are not suitable.
 The site should be free of dead roots of big trees as they harbour Armillaria root rot.
 The site should be free of perennial weeds, e.g. couch grass.
 If the site is sloping, appropriate soil conservation structures are needed.
 The plantation should be close to a road, for easy transport of the produce, inputs and planting
material.
Preparing the land
 Bananas can be planted on fallow land (ideally after 3â€“5 years of fallow) or in newly established
fields. If the latter, bush should be cleared and any debris removed or burned. If fallow land is
used, the vegetation should be cleared without burning, as burning destroys useful organic
matter.

Fig. 3. Digging a planting hole.

 A few days after cutting the vegetation, the remaining grass may be sprayed with an appropriate
herbicide to speed up organic matter breakdown. A pre-planting weed spray can reduce later
weed control applications and reduce costs. If paraquat (e.g. Gramoxone) is used, ploughing can
be done 2 days after spraying; if glyphosate (e.g. Roundup) is used, ploughing can be done after 2
weeks.
 Generally two ploughings are sufficient to provide a good seedbed for the banana plantation. A
couple of weeks should be left between the two ploughings to allow germination of weed seeds
which are then killed with another herbicide application prior to the following ploughing.
Preparing the planting holes
 The recommended spacing between plants is 3 m between the planting rows and 3 m within the
row (3 Ã— 3 m) or wider, depending on the soil fertility.
 Rows should be straight in flat fields to give plants the maximum amount of sunlight. On sloping
land, the rows should follow the contour lines in order to decrease soil erosion.
 Intercropping increases plant spacing, and 6 Ã— 6 m is often used.
 Minimum planting hole size is 30 Ã— 30 Ã— 30 cm. The most common planting hole size is 45 Ã— 45 Ã—
45 cm. The maximum planting hole size is 60 Ã— 60 Ã— 60 cm. Large and deep planting holes ensure
that the roots exploit the greatest volume of soil, and also makes plants more stable and less
likely to topple in high wind.
 The topsoil, which contains humus, should be separated from the sub-soil during the process of
digging the planting hole.
 Organic manure such as cow dung or chicken droppings is applied to the hole. The manure should
be mixed in equal quantities with the topsoil dug from the hole and the manure/soil mixture
placed in the planting hole. Do not fill the planting hole to the top, so that there is some space for
collecting rainwater around the growing sucker.

54

Fig. 4. Mixing manure and soil before placing it in the planting hole.

 If the manure is very fresh, then planting should be delayed for 6 weeks to 2 months to avoid
damaging the plants (through heat production during fermentation of the manure). On the other
hand, if the manure is well dried, planting can be carried out on the same day.
 Planting should ideally occur at the onset of the rainy season.

&				
Q1: What is the standard size of a planting hole?
A1: The size of the planting hole depends on many factors including soil type, soil texture, etc. It is
common practice to dig a hole measuring 45 cm Ã— 45 cm Ã— 45 cm.
Q2: If intercropping banana and coffee, when is it best to demarcate the planting holes for coffee?
A2: It is best to plan and demarcate the planting holes for both coffee and banana at the same time.
Q3: Should the planting holes be dug and manure applied on the same day? And can the bananas be
planted on the same day?
A3: It is fine to dig the planting hole and apply manure at the same time. Whether you can also plant
on the same day depends on the manure you are using. If the manure is very well dried and well
mixed with the topsoil, then it is okay to plant on the same day.

available).

56


How to plant the different types of banana planting material
 Dig holes and apply manure as described in the previous session. Organic manure from farmersâ€™
own farmyards is recommended. Use of artificial (inorganic) fertilizers should be minimized as
much as possible because of the high costs associated with them. Farmers who chose to use
inorganic fertilizer should read the labels and follow the instructions. Where organic manure is
used on the same day of planting, ensure that you mix it thoroughly with an equal amount of
topsoil.
 For tissue culture plants: first remove the plantlet from plastic bag, taking care that the soil
around the plantlet does not break up. Do not damage the plant or dislodge the soil when
removing the plantlet from the bag: use a knife instead of a hoe.
 For suckers and tissue culture plants: dig a small hole in the middle of the hole that was earlier
dug and filled with a mixture of topsoil and organic manure. Place the sucker or tissue culture
plants in the middle of the dug hole at a depth of about 30 cm, leaving 15 cm at the bottom of
the hole for the mixture of topsoil and manure (in a 45 cm hole).
 For corms: dig a small hole in the middle of the hole that was earlier dug and filled with a mixture
of topsoil and manure. Place the corm pieces in the middle of the hole at a depth of 10 cm.
Ensure that the bud/eye is facing downwards and the cut end upwards to prevent the bud from
rotting.
Initial care immediately after planting
Immediately after planting, place some dry grass (mulch) in a layer 2â€“3 cm thick around the plantlets
or corm piece, ensuring that some space is left between the plant and the mulch (at least 2 cm).
Water the plant carefully, using a watering can with small nozzles or by wetting the mulch layer.
Ensure that the water is poured on the dry grass acting as mulch. The plant should be given plenty of
water â€“ at least 2 liters â€“ on the day of planting. If there is no rain after planting, the plants must be
watered daily (preferably in the evening) using at least half a liter per plant during the first 2 weeks.
The best practice is to plant at the onset of the rains.

The best conditions for planting bananas
 Bananas are ideally planted in the early part of the rainy season. Because they should be able to
grow vigorously and without stress during the first 4â€“6 months after planting, they should not be
planted during the last months of the rainy season.
 25 mm of rainwater per week is the minimal requirement for satisfactory growth. Annual rainfall
of 2,000â€“2,500 mm is satisfactory.

&				
Q1: For how long should I water the banana plantlet after planting?
A1: The best practice is to water until the plantlet starts developing new leaves. However, you do
not have to keep watering if it is raining sufficiently.
Q2: What is the significance of applying mulch around the newly planted bananas?
A2: This is done to prevent water loss. As the plantlets are fragile immediately after planting, if they
dry out they can become damaged or die.
Q3: When is the best time to plant the bananas â€“ is it in the middle of the rainy season or at the
onset?
A3: The best time to plant bananas is at the onset of the rainy season. This means that you have to
have the field prepared (planting holes dug and manure applied into the holes) before the rains
start.
Q4: Would you recommend intercropping banana and maize?
A4: It is not recommended to intercrop maize and banana since maize will compete with bananas for
light. Also, unlike crops that fix nitrogen in the soil, for example beans, maize does not add any
nutrients into the soil.
Q5: Why is it that in the past (20 years ago) banana fields lasted longer than they do today?
A5: There could be several reasons to explain why banana fields used to last longer in the past, such
as less disease pressure (e.g. diseases like Xanthomonas wilt were not yet present), soil fertility was
not as depleted as it is currently, and global warming was not as intense as it is now. But if you take
care of your banana field it should last for 10 years.

Mulching
Advantages of mulching:
 Restricts weed growth: a closed mulch cover (â‰¥2 cm) suppresses almost all weeds
 Protects the soil against heavy rainfall and intensive sunshine
 Prevents erosion: stops loss of rich topsoil, where banana roots feed
 Adds nutrients, especially potassium and other cations: mulch spread to a depth of 2 cm over a
hectare can add as much as 300 kg of potassium
 Stimulates root development
 Improves soil drainage
 Decreases soil temperature
 Increases soil porosity and biological life
 Conserves water by reducing evaporation and improving infiltration rates. Bananas require a lot
of water (1,500 mm/year); when rainfall is only 1,000 mm/year, you will experience about 50%
yield loss. So, especially when rainfall is low, it is very important to conserve water.
Different mulching materials:
 Organic matter obtained from the banana plantation itself: leaves, debris, pseudostem, stalks,
etc.
 Mulching plants that are easy to grow and which produce a substantial amount of vegetable
matter, for example Pennisetum purpureum (elephant grass), Tripsacum laxurn (Guatemala grass)
and Panicum maximum (Guinea grass)
 Animal organic matter (e.g. poultry, pig and cow manures), which should be spread near the
plant
 Cover crops as live mulch (e.g. legumes) for the first 12 months.
Precautions that need to be taken while mulching:
 Mulching is known to increase pest attack and toppling, and so a ring should be left around the
plant base where the mulch does not touch the plant
 If thick mulch is introduced early, and in contact with the plants, this can cause high mats. This
increases likelihood of banana plants toppling, especially during high winds.
Water conservation
Banana is a succulent crop which requires a lot of water and is susceptible to drought. In areas which
receive less than 1,000 mm of annual rainfall, water conservation practices are important. Methods
that can be used include:
 Irrigation: the most common yet most expensive method of providing continuous water to crops
 Heavy mulching: a 15 cm layer of mulch regularly applied to the field minimizes evaporation and
water run-off

60

 Contour trenches: these should be 30â€“45 cm deep, 45â€“60 cm wide, with a bund of 30â€“45 cm
down the slope, planted with fodder grass
 Trench composting: trenches should be 45 cm wide and 30 cm deep, in between the rows of
plants, filled with a biodegradable substance such as manure or organic matter from the
plantation, and covered with top soil; when it rains the compost absorbs and stores water which
the plants can use during dry periods.

&				
Q1: Should mulching material always be dry?
A1: Yes. Material that is not dry should not be used as mulch because it can easily rot in the field and
produce heat (through fermentation) that can be dangerous to the plants.
Q2: Does mulching control banana weevils?
A2: No, mulching does not control banana weevils. In fact, it increases their multiplication since it
provides them with a favourable environment to reproduce. This is why it is not recommended to
apply mulch close to the banana plant.
Q3: Can a farmer who mulches his plantation but does not apply fertilizers obtain big bunches?
A3: A farmer could still get quite big bunches, but they would be bigger if fertilizer was also used.
The best bunches are produced where all the recommended agronomic practices are carried out,
including both mulching and applying fertilizer.
Q4: Would you recommend a farmer to water his or her banana plantation even after mulching?
A4: Yes, it important to water the plantation even after mulching (unless there is plenty of rain).
Mulching does not add water to the soils but only conserves water which is already there by
reducing the rate at which the soil loses water to the atmosphere.
Q5: Is it essential for a banana field to have trenches?
A5: No, it is not essential. Trenches are usually dug where water flows through the banana field, in
order to trap the water and also control erosion.
Q6: As mulching conserves water in the soil, is it also necessary to dig trenches in a mulched banana
field?
A6: If there is water flowing through the field, the trenches are needed even if the field is mulched.
Mulching and trenches have different roles: mulching conserves water in the soil, whereas the
trenches trap the water within the field and also stop topsoil from being eroded.
Q7: When is the best time to dig trenches? Can one dig trenches before planting?
A7: Trenches are ideally dug immediately after the banana field is established, so that the young
plants can benefit from the water that they hold. It is ok to dig trenches before planting, but it will
be best if you dig them after digging the planting holes.


Plant nutrition
As a plant grows, it takes up nutrients from the soil. A lot of the nutrients taken up by a banana plant
go into the fruits (bunch). Farmers remove the fruits and they are sold, and so nutrients are lost
from the system. The only way to maintain soil fertility is by regularly putting back nutrients into the
soil in the form of organic or inorganic fertilizer. If fertility is not maintained in this way, even the
most fertile soils will gradually become unproductive.
Nutrients needed for banana production
Bananas have a high demand for nitrogen (N) and potassium (K). Other minerals that are vital for
banana production, though in small quantities, include phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg) and calcium
(Ca). Each nutrient plays a different role in banana production as follows:
 N contributes to overall growth of a banana plant, and keeps leaves green and healthy which
allows bananas to capture more sunlight to make big bunches
 K helps with movement of food and water from the roots to the leaves and bunches
 P helps the banana plant to have strong and healthy roots that will capture more water and
nutrients from the soil
 Mg helps the leaves to use the sunlight captured to make food.
Symptoms of nutrients deficiencies in banana
Nitrogen
Symptoms of nitrogen deficiency develop quickly over leaves of all ages. Symptoms include:
 Leaves are very small and pale green
 Mid-rib, petioles and leaf sheaths become reddish pink
 The rate at which leaves are produced decreases
 Distance between successive leaves is reduced, giving the plant a rosette appearance
 Growth is poor, leading to a stunted plant
 Banana bunches become small.
Potassium
Symptoms of potassium deficiency normally appear at the time of flowering; they include:
 Rapid appearance of orange5yellow colour on the older leaves and their subsequent drying and
death
 The mid-rib of the leaves exhibiting symptoms are often bent or broken at a distance of two-
thirds along the length, so that the leaf points towardsthe base of the plant
 Small leaves
 Delayed flowering
 Reduced bunch sizes.

63

Phosphorus
Deficiency symptoms of phosphorus are rarely seen in the field. They however include:
 Stunted growth and poor root development
 In the older four or five leaves, the leaf margins (edges) lose their colour (chlorosis). Then purple
brown flecks develop that eventually combine until leaf edges are dead
 Affected leaves curl and the petioles break
 Young leaves have a deep bluish green colour.
Magnesium
 Yellowing (chlorosis) of leaf margins of older leaves; the yellowing extends towards the mid-rib,
with a green band remaining near the mid-rib, and is more severe where the leaves are exposed
to the sun.
Fertilizers for banana production
Organic fertilizers
Good organic fertilizers include:
 Crop residues (e.g. bean hulls and stalks, maize stovers, sorghum residues and millet residues),
other plant residues (e.g. swamp and elephant grass (chopped and dried))
 Animal waste (e.g. cow and chicken manure).
These fertilizers can be applied individually and directly, or can be combined and composted. An
important use for organic fertilizer (mature compost or manure) is in the planting hole, mixed with
soil. In established plantations organic fertilizer may be placed on the soil surface in a ring or furrow
45 cm from a mat, or can be ploughed into the soil around the plant.
Inorganic fertilizers
There are different types of fertilizers available that provide the same nutrients. Table 1 shows some
commonly used fertilizers and the nutrients they provide. The rate of application depends on how
quickly the nutrient is removed from the soil. Some nutrients leach very quickly when it rains, and
these ones need to be added frequently but in small quantities, as shown in Table 1.

Applying inorganic fertilizers
Remove trash and make a ring about 30 cm away from the stool (mother plant and suckers). Sprinkle
and spread the measured amount of fertilizer in the ring. Cover the fertilizer with soil but do not
work it (dig it) into the soil, because you may cause damage to the superficial roots of the banana
plant.

Q1: Is it true that liquid manure cures Xanthomonas wilt?
A1: No, it is not true. At the moment the disease has no cure, it can only be controlled with
preventive measures that limit the spread of the disease.
Q2: Which is better for banana production: chicken or cow manure?
A2: Both types of manure are good, and the type of manure you use depends on availability.
However, chicken manure is used up faster than cow manure, so cow manure is better from that
point of view.
Q3: How can I tell fake fertilizers from genuine fertilizers?
A3: The only way is to buy fertilizers from a reputable agro-input dealer or company.
Q4: What is the maximum amount of organic fertilizers recommended for a banana plant? Is it
possible to â€˜overdoseâ€™ with organic fertilizers, as is the case with inorganic ones?
A4: No, overdose with organic fertilizers is very unlikely, but farmers should avoid using too much as
it is a waste. For bananas, apply only two basins (~ 20 kg) of organic manure at the beginning of the
rains.


Weeds
A weed is a plant growing where it is not wanted and having a harmful impact.
Importance of weed control
The removal of weeds is important because:
 These plants compete with the crop plants for space, water and nutrients

66

 Weeding helps to â€˜loosenâ€™ the soil, so that water can infiltrate more rapidly and roots of the
cultivated plants can develop more easily
 Weeds act as alternate hosts for insect pests and diseases, i.e. they increase pest and disease
problems
 Weeds reduce fertilizer efficiency and thus banana yields.
Timing of weeding
Weed control is particularly important during the first year of plantation establishment, while the
banana plants become established. Once the plants are big enough that the leaves completely shade
the ground, weeds become less of a problem and mulching can be sufficient to keep the weeds
down.
Types of weeding
1. Cultural

Weeds can be hand-pulled or weeded with a hoe.

Hand or hoe weeding can be carried out alone or combined with chemical weed control. For
example, ring or row weeding of the banana plants can be followed by herbicide application on
the remaining weeds.

When the plants are mature, avoid use of a hoe when weeding.
2. Chemical

Chemical weed control is less laborious, provides longer control and is faster than hand or hoe
weeding.

Chemical weed killers are applied using a knapsack sprayer. Spraying should be done at a time
when there is no or little wind.

Herbicides commonly used include paraquat (e.g. Gramoxone) and glyphospate (e.g. Roundup).
If a contact herbicide such as glyphosate or 2,4-D is used, precautions must be taken to avoid
drift onto the bananas.

Farmers must follow the manufacturerâ€™s recommended dosage.

Do not smoke or eat during treatment and avoid contaminating water for human/animal
consumption with herbicides. Do not reuse herbicide containers for domestic purposes.

&				
Q1: Is it true that herbicides stay active for a long time after application?
A1: Yes, some herbicides can stay active in the soil for a long time, especially if not used properly.
This is called a residual effect.
Q2: Is it okay to mix different herbicides together, e.g. mixing those that are effective on broad-
leafed weeds and those that work on grasses?
A2: No, herbicides should never be mixed, because it can disrupt the active ingredients. The
exception is if there is a commercial product that contains mixed active ingredients.

next session should have an old banana field with some visible symptoms of disease and
pest infestation. The training could take place at several fields so that more banana pests
and diseases are seen.


68


Intercropping
 During the first few months, before the banana canopy closes, there is some space available
between rows. This space can be used for plants that have a short life cycle and that do not
compete with bananas.
 The intercrop should be planted before (e.g. coffee or cocoa) or at the same time (e.g. legumes
such as groundnuts, vegetables or maize) as the bananas.
 Do not plant too close to the banana plant to avoid direct competition for nutrients between the
banana plant and the intercrop.
 In mature plantations (after the first crop), intercropping, especially with annual crops, should be
discontinued.
 With beans as intercrops, minimum tillage is used.

Advantages of intercropping
Disadvantages of intercropping
 Land gives a return before the banana crop is
ready to be harvested
 Weed control is easier
 Soil is protected against erosion
 Soil moisture is conserved
 Organic matter is added to the soil
 Competition with bananas for nutrients,
sunlight
 Labour requirements may be higher
 The intercrop may attract pests that could be
harmful to the banana plants

De-suckering
 De-suckering â€“ removing the suckers â€“ is done to reduce competition (for water, light and
nutrients) and maximize yield.
 De-sucker the banana mat to a total of three plants at different growth stages (mother, daughter
and granddaughter). That is, only one sucker from each successive generation is allowed to grow.
 Take care not to harm the motherplant and the suckers that are being retained. For de-suckering,
choose suckers that are coming from well down on the corm because the banana plant has a
tendency to grow out of the ground. Also, choose suckers on the opposite side of the bunch of
the motherplant.
 De-suckering should be timed so that the farmer can take advantage of peak marketing seasons
such as Christmas.
De-leafing
 De-leafing is the process of removing dead hanging leaves covering the young suckers and the old
sheaths on the base of pseudostem which would otherwise provide an ideal refuge for adult
banana weevils.
 Remove dead sheaths and leaves regularly, and use them as mulch (if no banana weevils are
evident).

69

Fig. 8. Explaining routine field management to farmers.
 Leave enough leaves to produce a good quality bunch (at least 9â€“12 leaves at flowering and 4 at
harvest).
 De-leafing of the plant immediately prior to harvest is not recommended as this starts the
ripening process.
Cutting off male buds
 Male buds are removed to encourage development of the young bunch and to protect the plant
from being infected with Xanthomonas wilt. Care should be taken not to damage the hands of
the bunch. Remove the male bud with a forked stick immediately after the last cluster forms. Do
not chop off the male bud, as knives/pangas can easily spread infection.
Propping
 The heavy weight of the banana bunch can cause the pseudostem to break, or can uproot
(topple) the entire corm. Propping is done to prevent this. Most plants need this, but especially
during the dry season, in strong winds, or if infested with nematodes or banana weevils.
 The support can be made from one or two wood props (usually bamboo). A lateral branch with a
natural fork can also be used. Depending on the weight of the bunch, the branch or branches can
be placed underneath the bunch or along the pseudostem.

&				
Q1: Is it true that you can tell the future size of the bunch by looking at the size of the bud?
A1: Yes, to some extent it is true but there are other factors that also affect the size of a bunch.
Q2: Doesnâ€™t regular de-suckering weaken the banana field?
A2: No, it will only weaken the banana field if the job is not done properly.
Q3: Does removing a male bud helps control banana pests such as the banana weevil?
A3: No, removal of the male bud has nothing to do with controlling banana weevil. However,
removal of male buds helps in controlling the spread of Xanthomonas wilt.

Banana pests
Two important pests of bananas in East Africa are the banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) and
plant-parasitic nematodes. These pests may result in severe yield loss if not controlled.
Banana weevil
Damage and symptoms:
 Banana weevil damage results from larvae feeding and tunnelling into banana corms and
pseudostems.
 The adult banana weevil lays its eggs near the corm and, on hatching, the larva attacks the
underground part, boring tunnels in it.
 As banana weevil larvae grow in size, they make large tunnels of up to 1.5 cm in diameter that
may extend 60â€“100 cm up the pseudostem. The damage weakens the plant and interferes with
uptake of nutrients and water.
 Weevil infestation of young plants causes stunting, disruption and delay of fruiting, and
sometimes leads to plant death.
 Heavily infested plants produce small bunches and have reduced resistance to drought and
strong winds, sometimes leading to snapping and toppling of plants.
 The banana weevil causes more damage to cooking bananas than to beer bananas.
Cultural control measures:
Cultural control, based on manipulation of banana weevil habitat and oviposition sites, provides the
first line of defence against the banana weevil. It is cheap and does not entail extra inputs. Cultural
control practices include:
 Use of clean planting material. This reduces the spread of the weevils which are usually carried to
new sites with infested suckers. Clean suckers may be obtained from non-infested fields, by
paring the corm to remove eggs and larvae, and by use of tissue culture plants.

Fig. 9. Banana weevil damage.

72

 Good crop husbandry. This produces vigorous plants that are more tolerant to banana weevil
damage. It involves regular weeding, de-suckering, adding manure and mulching,
 Destruction of post-harvest residues. Removal and splitting of harvested stems into small strips
and spreading them out to dry quickly reduces hiding and breeding sites for the banana weevil. It
also exposes weevil eggs and larvae to desiccation. Burning of the residues can also be done at a
safe distance from the plantation.
 Trapping. Two types of traps are used: pseudostem and disc-on-stump traps. The pseudostem
trap is made from pseudostem pieces split longitudinally into halves, and placed against a banana
plant with split surface on the ground. The disc-on-stump traps are made by cutting harvested
stumps 15â€“25 cm above ground level and then placing a pseudostem sheath or banana leaves on
top of the stump. The banana weevils attracted to these traps are collected and destroyed. Traps
remain effective for about 1â€“2 weeks and are renewed whenever pseudostem pieces are
available.
 Use of mixtures of ash, urine and insecticidal plants. Farmers often use concoctions containing
various amounts of ash, urine, tobacco, capsicum and other weed species. The method and rates
of application vary from farmer to farmer. A 14-day fermented mixture is often used, at the rate
of 1â€“2 cups (500â€“1,000 ml) per banana stool. While the practice is being recommended by some
organizations, especially those promoting organic farming, its efficacy is unclear.
Chemical control measures:
 Monitoring of banana weevils is recommended before chemical control is used. Chemical control
should only be considered if monitoring results in more than 2 weevils per trap.
 At planting, an insecticide such as carbofuran (e.g. Furadan) can be applied around the sucker in
the planting hole.
 For an established plantation, an insecticide can be applied to the soil around the base of the
banana stool.
 Chemical pesticides can also be used with pseudostem or disc-on- stump traps in mature banana
plantations to kill weevils in the traps.
Nematodes (eelworms)
Several nematode species attacks banana roots: Meloidogyne spp., Radopholus similis,
Helicotylenchus multicinctus and Pratylenchus coffeae.
Damage and symptoms:
Nematodes are not seen by the naked eye and their damage is therefore often underestimated.
However, they are very serious banana pests. Infestation occurs in roots. Symptoms include:
 Stunted growth
 Plants easily uprooted by wind (toppling), particularly those with bunches
 Root damage: in early stages brown threads appear in the root; at later stages roots become dark
brown and rot; the root system is reduced and appears short and black
 Leaves lose green colour and turn yellow; then dry and drop off
 Bunches produce few clusters with small fingers.

73

Cultural control measures:
 Plant resistant cultivars
 Use clean planting material
 Hot water treatment: after paring, dip suckers in water of 50â€“55Â°C for 15â€“20 minutes, or boiling
water for 1â€“2 minutes
 Prepare land in the dry season
 If a field is highly infested, uproot all plants and leave it fallow for 2 years
 Practice crop rotation with root crops like cassava and sweet potato
 Mulch the plantation, since mulched plants tend to cope better with nematodes.
Chemical control measures:
 Use of nematicides is currently the only method that effectively controls nematodes in an
established banana plantation. The recommended chemical is carbofuran (e.g. Furadan). Always
follow the instructions as prescribed on the label or have the input supplier explain to you the
application rates before using any nematicide.
Other pests
Monkeys can be destructive, especially in plantations near forests. Monkeys can be scared off by
dogs or guards.
Ants can dig up soil and expose the banana corms, making the plants more susceptible to toppling.
Banana diseases
The major diseases found in East Africa are: Mycosphaerella leaf spot (also called black sigatoka,
Panama wilt and black leaf streak, caused by Mycosphaerella spp.), Fusarium wilt (caused by
Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense) and Xanthomonas wilt (bacterial wilt, caused by Xanthomonas
campestris pv. musacearum). Other diseases are less important and include Armillaria corm rot
(caused by Armellaria spp.), anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum musae), cucumber mosaic virus
(CMV), cigar end (caused by Verticillium theobromae and Trachysphaera fructigena) and
Cladosporium speckle (caused by Cladosporium musae).
Leaf diseases may be difficult to identify in the field, and farmers often confuse their symptoms with
banana weevil damage and nutrient deficiencies. The diseases are worse where other stresses are
severe, such as banana weevils, nematodes or nutrient deficiency.
Black sigatoka
This is the most important leaf disease. Symptoms and damage include:
 Large reddish-brown streaks on underside of leaves, especially 4th leaf
 Advanced stage has blackened patches on topside of leaf
 Leaf blade edges folded
 Affected plants have few functional leaves (three or four)
 Leaves appear burnt
 Fruits ripen before maturity

74

Fig. 10.Demonstrating black sigatoka in farmersâ€™ fields.
 Small fingers.
Cultural control measures:
 There are no fully effective control measures for this disease at the moment
 Use resistant cultivars, e.g. FHIA-17, FHIA-23, Musakala, Namaliga, Kibuzi, Mbwazirume
 Maintain soil fertility, which enhances plant vigour
 Remove/burn infected material
 Remove unwanted suckers
 Free the plantation from weeds
 Use clean banana planting materials (such as banana tissue culture) when starting a banana farm.
Fusarium wilt
Fusarium wilt is caused by a fungus that lives in the soil and attacks the plant through the lateral
roots. The disease can be very destructive and can cause yield losses of up to 100%. The pathogen
can stay in the soil long after the banana plant has gone. The disease affects especially the cultivars
Sukali Ndiizi, Kisubi and Kayinja. The disease is easily spread through infected suckers.
Symptoms:
 Yellowing of leaves
 Wilting of all leaves
 Leaf sheaths loosen and pseudostem splits
 Emerging leaves are whitish
 Attacked plant may fail to flower and to develop a bunch.

75

Cultural control measures:
 There are no fully effective  control measures for this disease at the moment
 Remove/uproot infected plants and their suckers, and destroy them
 Use resistant cultivars: FHIA-17, FHIA-23, FHIA-3
 Do not move suckers from infected to non-infected areas
 Fusarium wilt can spread in the soil that adheres to tools and shoes. Keep farm tools and shoes
clean.
Xanthomonas wilt
Xanthomonas wilt is caused by a bacterium and is spread from a sick plant to a healthy one by bees
visiting the male bud, by farm tools such as knives and hoes, or by planting diseased suckers.
Symptoms:
 Male bud wilts and fruit ripens early when the bunch is still young
 Young leaves turn brown and wilt
 Fruits show brown discolouration when cut
 Stem oozes yellow liquid when cut.
Cultural control measures:
 There are no fully effective control measures for this disease at the moment
 Remove the male bud. Use a forked stick to remove the male bud after the last cluster forms
 Destroy diseased plants. Chop and sun-dry diseased plants and suckers
 Use clean planting material (clean suckers or tissue culture plants)
 Always disinfect tools with fire or bleach.
Armillaria corm rot
This occurs in plantations planted on cleared forest land. The disease affects the roots, corms and
stumps.
Symptoms:
 Yellowing and death of leaves
 Advanced infection results in total collapse of the plant.
Cultural control measures:
 There are no fully effective control measures for this disease at the moment
 Burn infected plants
 Complete removal of all stumps and large roots
 Use tolerant cultivars such as FHIAs.

76

Anthracnose
Anthracnose affects fruit. This disease is most common on cooking bananas.
Symptoms:
 Small black circular specks on flower and skin
 Tip of banana fruit hardens
 At an advanced stage, sunken lesions appear to form large spots on surface.
Control measures:
 Monitoring of field conditions
 Isolation of infected plant material.

&				
Q1: Do bees transmit black sigatoka?
A1: No, bees do not transmit black sigatoka. They do however transmit Xanthomonas wilt.
Q2: Is there any relationship between nutrient deficiency and diseases in bananas?
A2: Yes, there is a big relationship. Bananas that lack some nutrients are stressed and are much
more easily attacked by diseases.
Q3: What would you consider the most dangerous disease of bananas at the moment, Xanthomonas
wilt or Fusarium wilt?
A3: At the moment, Xanthomonas wilt is considered the most dangerous disease.
Q4: If banana has Mycosphaerella leaf spot, can it still produce bunches?
A4: Yes, bananas that are infected with Mycosphaerella leaf spot still produce bunches. However,
the farmer should provide more manure to such bananas to increase the plantâ€™s vigour and help it
withstand the disease.
Q5: Do bananas share any diseases with other crops like beans?
A5: Some of the types of pathogens that cause disease in banana are also found in beans. However,
pathogens are generally rather specific, and diseases specific to banana do not occur on beans.

Q1: What is the best tree species to plant with bananas?
A1: Coffee is an ideal intercrop with bananas. Trees that add nitrogen to the soil (like Calliandra and
Sesbania) are also good to plant with bananas. Other tree species like Ficus can be planted to
provide shade.
Q2: Is it okay to grow different cultivars of bananas in one field?
A2: It is advised not to mix cultivars, as some cultivars are more susceptible to pests and diseases
which may then spread to the others. The banana field should be organized according to cultivars.
Q3: What are the signs of Xanthomonas wilt?
A3: The symptoms are: male bud wilts and fruits ripen early when the bunch is still young, young
leaves turn brown and wilt, fruits show brown discoloration when cut, and the pseudostem oozes
yellowish liquid when cut.

80

Q4: Can bananas be grown in swampy areas?
A4: Yes, they can be grown in swampy areas, as long as the soil is not waterlogged for long periods.
Q5. How would you control monkeys that destroy the bananas?
A5: You can use a scarecrow in the banana field, or have the field guarded by a dog to scare away
the monkeys.
Q6: Why is â€˜matookeâ€™ from Western Uganda different in taste to that from Central Uganda?
A6: This is caused by a number of factors, such as the soils, the rainfall pattern, management
practices, etc.
Q7: Can I grow bananas together with pineapples?
A7: Yes, bananas can be grown together with pineapples, but if bananas are the main crop, then
they need to be planted using a relatively bigger spacing.
Q8: What would you recommend and why: cooking or roasting types?
A8: This totally depends on the farmerâ€™s interest. The management practices are the same.
Q9: Is it good to plant fruit trees with bananas?
A9: It is okay to plant fruit trees with bananas, but ensure that the spacing is optimal to avoid
competition for soil nutrients and light. Make sure the fruit trees are pruned regularly.
Q10: Can bananas planted without manure produce big bunches?
A10: Yes, if the soil is very fertile, and good management practices are used.
Q11: When is the best time to cut off the male bud?
A11: When all the fingers have developed from the flowers.
Q12: Is it true that hoes should not be used to control weeds in bananas?
A12: It not true. However, precaution should be taken when using a hoe to not damage the roots of
the bananas.
Q13: How long does a banana take to mature?
A13: Bananas take about one year from planting before the fruits are ready to eat.
Q14: Can nutrient deficiency weaken the bananas?
A14: Yes, nutrient deficiency weakens the bananas and also leads to poor harvest.
Q15: Is it okay to spray herbicides in a banana field intercropped with coffee?
A15: Yes, it is okay as long as the herbicide is used according to the manufacturerâ€™s specifications.

Farming as a business
A business is an activity that aims to earn a profit through providing a service or a product. Farming
as a business is built on the principles of improving farm production to increase profits and/or
ensure sustainability of farm output.
The importance of farming as a business
Treating farming as a business helps farmers to get the best out of their farms and their resources.
Applying business methods, such as record keeping and benefitâ€“cost analysis, to farming can greatly
improve its efficiency. The following are some benefits from taking a business approach to farming:
 Farm goals are defined, such as
â€“ Where is the business going?
â€“ What needs to be done?

85

 When everyone involved with the farm (family members, extension workers, development
agencies, etc.) understands the goals, they will work better together towards them.
 Valuable information is collected through record keeping, and used to make better decisions
affecting the farm. For example, production records might show a reduction in output, and the
farmer may decide to increase the number of banana plants or change his or her agronomic
practices to improve yields; or sales records may show a loss over time, which the farmer can
investigate and address, perhaps by changing planting dates in order to target times when prices
are high in the market.
 Communication about the business is improved. For example, a farmer who has proper cash flow
details about his or her farm can communicate better to other stakeholders such as loan officers
about the viability of the farm to service a loan.
 An organized farming business is more likely to attract capital from private investors, venture
capital funds, lenders, banks, trust companies, etc.
Requirements for a successful farming business
 Skills and knowledge necessary to grow crops or raise animals
 Production requirements such as land for growing crops, labour for farm activities, capital which
can be in form of tools, equipments, building or cash, and organization which enables optimal use
of all the resources available
 Marketing skills.

Q1: Can farmers with less than 1 hectare of land carry out farming as a business?
A1: Yes. Farming as a business has nothing to do with farm size. It aids you in making decisions
regarding practices you perform on your farm, which can be of any size.
Q2: Do I need to acquire a certificate from the local authorities for my farm to be considered a
business?
A2: In Uganda, farmers involved in primary farm production (with no major value addition) donâ€™t
need to acquire a certificate and they donâ€™t pay taxes for farming.
Q3: Will my farm be eligible for business loans if I am running it as a business?
A3: For a farm business or any business to be eligible for a business loan, a bank has to assess its
viability, that is, whether the business has the potential to pay back a loan. If you keep good records
and can show that you can pay back the loan, then your farm will be eligible.


Record keeping and its importance
Record keeping is the systematic compilation of certain types of information. Reliable and accurate
records are used to make better decisions affecting the farm.
For example, farmers should record:
 All incomes and costs as soon as they are incurred. These are then summarized periodically, e.g.
by week, month, quarterly or annually. By comparing annual income to annual costs, you can
determine whether you have made a profit or a loss over the year.

87

 Prices received from buyers every time a sale is made. This will help identify periods during the
year when higher prices can be obtained, or buyers who offer a better price. With this
information, farmers can adjust production so that they have more produce available when
prices are higher.
 Yields obtained and total sales (by volume and price) for products in order to enable comparison
with previous years, and forecasting for future years.
 Applications made such as fertilizers, mulch and water, and yields, in order to identify the best
inputs and input schedules, and also compare costs of applications against increased (or
decreased) yields.
Types of farm records
1. Farm planning schedule. This details the planned farm activities and the tentative dates for
carrying them out. The schedule should be among the first records a farm manager produces.

2. Input record. An input record details the materials purchased and invested in the business. This
should include the name of the input, the date of purchase, the price of the input, the amount of
input(s) obtained, the total expenditure and where possible the expected useful life of the input.

aLand is an important input in a banana farm. Therefore, land holding (land owned, rented or
purchased) could be added along with the costs if required.

3. Labour record. This type of record details the labour used for the various tasks on the farm.
Information in the record includes the activities, the period when the activities took place, the
duration of the activities, the amount of labour used and the cost of the labour.

4. Production record. This record details the output from the business in a given period. It is
advisable to record information in the production records at regular intervals, e.g. weekly, bi-weekly,
monthly or quarterly.

Q1: Do I have to include everything that has been discussed here in my own farm records?
A1: You donâ€™t have to include everything that is being discussed here. You should try and capture
just the information that is necessary for you and your farm.
Q2: How can I estimate quantities of farm inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) if I donâ€™t have any
proper measuring equipment?
A2: You can use things like jerry can lids, or plastic bottles, as measures for your inputs. You can also
ask input sellers for their advice on estimating quantities of the inputs they are selling to you.
Q3: For the sales record, what do I record for the months I donâ€™t sell any bananas?
A3: If you did not sell any bananas, write a zero for that month in the correct column. This is a valid
record.
Q4: How do I record prices that vary every time I sell? The cell for recording the price is single for
every month?
A4: The record formats presented here are only a guide. You could devise your own format so that
you can capture the price of a bunch every time you sell.
Q5: Do I have to keep all these farm records if I donâ€™t sell my bananas?
A5: Even when you donâ€™t produce for the market, it is good to keep track of your farm activities, as
this can help you improve them. So always keep records about production activities, inputs and
yields.
Q6: Are the skills we are learning in this module applicable to other farm enterprises apart from
banana production?
A6: Yes, the concepts we are learning can be used for all farm enterprises.
Q7: Would you call a receipt book a record?
A7: Yes, a receipt book is a type of record. However, it only records payments or purchases of goods.
It does not capture most of the information that farmers need to improve their production.
Q8: How would you advise someone who cannot write to keep records?
A8: They should try and get a relative or friend to help them write the farm records.

 What are costs?
 What are benefits?
 What is meant by â€˜net incomeâ€™?
 How do you carry out a benefitâ€“cost analysis?
Prepare templates which will be used to capture costs and benefits in the dayâ€™s lesson, using the
examples in the Content section below. Print as many copies as the number of participants.

			
1. Have a volunteer participant briefly recap the content of the previous session.
2. Open the dayâ€™s session by displaying the flipchart with the title of the session.
3. Present the questions on the flipchart one at a time and have participants respond. Write down
the responses. Encourage participants to provide examples where appropriate. Where
necessary, supplement the discussion.
4. Divide participants into groups of 5â€“10 people and have each group write down costs and
revenues for a theoretical banana farm on 1 acre (~ 0.40 ha) of land, using the templates
provided. Encourage participants to try and include all the different activities that are
undertaken during banana production as well as all the resources needed. Costs (estimated)
should be attached to all the listed activities/resources and total costs worked out. Revenue
should be based on estimated outputs and current market prices. Note that the actual figures
are not so important at this stage â€“ it is the process that the participants are learning.
5. Give the groups 45 minutes to perform the task before recalling them. A spokesperson for each
group should present the groupâ€™s work to the participants. Encourage the other participants to
ask questions. The facilitator should try to ask probing questions during the presentations that
should help the participants understand the concepts of benefitâ€“cost analysis. Questions could
include:
 How did you decide on the price for the outputs?
 Did you include the cost of transport of the equipment from the point of sale to your farm?

92

 How did you budget for family labour?
 What prompted your choice of type of planting materials?
 Did you consider that some cultivars produce better bunches than others?
6. After all groups have presented their work, lead the entire group in producing a comprehensive
benefitâ€“cost analysis for producing banana on 1 acre of land in their area.
7. Wrap up the training session as follows:
 Briefly recap the dayâ€™s session
 As homework, ask each participant to do a personal benefitâ€“cost analysis for their banana
farm. Where farmers are already growing bananas, they can draw up costs and benefits for
improving their current farms. Remind participants to bring their benefitâ€“cost analysis for
review in the next meeting.
 Communicate the topic of the next session (Savings), and the date, time and venue for the
session.

Costs
A business has many different costs, from paying for raw materials to paying the rent or the utility
bills. By careful classification of these costs a business can analyse its performance and make better
decisions. Business costs can be classified as:
 Variable costs: costs that change depending on the amount of output. These may include raw
materials, wages, fuel for machines, etc.
 Fixed costs: costs that remain the same no matter the level of production of the business. For
example, rent for land, or interest charges for a loan.
How to calculate the cost of production
Cost of production is the sum of the costs of the resources or inputs that went into producing a given
product.
Cost of production = total fixed costs (TFC) + total variable costs (TVC)

Benefitâ€“cost analysis
Benefitâ€“cost analysis is a process where costs and benefits are compared to determine whether a
business is profitable and therefore financially viable.
A benefitâ€“cost ratio is calculated by dividing total revenue by total costs. It is used to judge the
efficiency of the farm business. It indicates the relationship between farm expenses and returns. The
farm is said to be efficient when it yields a greater output per unit of input used, i.e. when the ratio
is > 1. A ratio > 2 is preferred in order to take into account unforeseen events associated with
agricultural production and which are not known when one computes a benefitâ€“cost ratio of a farm
business, such as inflation, natural risks (bad weather), biological risks (pests and diseases) or other
risks.

Q1: Do all farmers have to incur all the costs indicated in the benefitâ€“cost analysis?
A1: No. Different farmers incur different costs when producing banana. For example, some farmers
without pests in their fields will not incur costs of buying pesticides.
Q2: If a farmer has a small benefitâ€“cost ratio, would you recommend giving up on banana
production?
A2: A benefitâ€“cost ratio > 1 indicates that the farmer is making a profit from his farm, and a benefitâ€“
cost ratio < 1 indicates a loss. However, there may be reasons to explain the small ratio, which
means that a farmer should not immediately give up. For example, many farmers register a benefitâ€“
cost ratio < 1 in the first season and this then changes in following seasons, because the first season
requires the most investment.
Q3: If I use household labour on my banana farm, how do I record it as a cost of production?
A3: You should cost family labour as equivalent to hired labour, because if family labour is not being
used on the farm it could be used for other productive ventures.

What are savings?
Saving means withholding something valuable for future use. This can be in the form of cash or
material goods whose value appreciates over time. It entails discipline and sacrifice, as one
postpones consumption from now to a future date. It leads to capital accumulation over time, which
can be invested in profitable enterprises.
Why do people save?
People save for a variety of reasons, which include:
 To be prepared for future emergencies or risks, such as natural disasters, sickness or accidents
 To smooth out variations in income and consumption, i.e. saving during surplus periods for use
during difficult periods (â€˜saving for a rainy dayâ€™)
 To meet future obligations such as school fees, marriages, purchases of land and funerals
 To invest in profitable business opportunities such as buying a cow, opening a retail business or
trading agricultural produce
 In groups, the principle purpose for saving is to build up a group fund from which to lend to
individual members and to fund group economic activities or enterprises.
What are the various ways of savings?
People save in various ways, as individuals or in groups. The most common ways of saving are:
 Saving in kind, which is the most common way of saving among the poor. It entails investing in
items or goods whose value appreciates with time. This could be produce (grain), poultry, small
ruminants (goats or sheep) or cattle. This form of saving is most suited to local communities
where banking institutions are non-existent.
 Saving cash is usually the most preferred way of saving, because cash is portable, storable, not
very visible and can be exchanged for almost anything. It can be used to meet immediate needs
such as food, clothing, fees and medical expenses. Cash is best saved in the bank.
 Purchase of high value items, such as jewellery, is another way of saving. While this type of saving
may be portable, it is often difficult to convert it into cash.
 Saving can also be trade-based, that is, providing either labour or part of the harvest at a time of
abundance (e.g. soon after harvest) and claiming it back during a period of scarcity.
 Individuals may lend cash to others, which is payable after a specified period usually with
interest.
 Individuals may invest in small-scale businesses, which generate returns.
What are group savings?
A group of people with a common goal may pool some of their financial resources into group
savings. They save regularly in small amounts agreed on by the whole group, and the money can
then be loaned out to members or used to finance joint economic activities. As the funds
accumulate, safekeeping facilities are needed, and the group may decide to open an account in a
nearby bank. Group savings requires mutual trust among members. It also requires a high level of
integrity among members, especially from the leadership. Proper records and accounts need to be

101

maintained and regular reporting on the progress of individual memberâ€™s saving needs to be made.
Group record books should also be available for audits and scrutiny by members.
What are the advantages of saving in groups?
 Group savers may accumulate larger amounts of money than they would if saving as an
individual, as they will be motivated to save regularly.
 Group savers are eligible for loans from the group funds.
 Group savings can be used as insurance for individual members, who can borrow in emergencies.
 Saving as a group gives members access to safe-keeping facilities such as cash boxes and safes,
which may not be otherwise available in rural communities.
 Individuals are protected from demands from immediate family and relatives, who might want to
share their savings, as what is saved in the group is deemed as belonging to the group.
How to save as a group
1. Make savings and credit one of the key group objectives.
2. Decide how often the group will meet for purposes of saving. This could be weekly, bi-monthly or
monthly. The more frequently the members save, the faster the group fund will grow.
3. Decide the minimum that each member will contribute at each meeting. It is better to start with
a small amount that all members can afford and increase when membersâ€™ incomes improve.
4. Agree on a set of rules and regulations to govern saving and lending to members in order to
ensure discipline and trust. These rules must be strictly enforced.
5. Elect a working committee to oversee saving and lending activities. The elected leaders should be
honest and trustworthy.
6. Procure safe-keeping facilities such as cash boxes or safes, and/or open an account in the bank.
7. Decide on how long members need to save before lending can start. The earlier members can
access loan funds the more they are likely to continue saving.
8. Agree on loan terms, especially interest to be charged, loan period, grace period and any charges
for late payment or default.

&				
Q1: Is it possible for non-members to join the groupâ€™s saving and credit scheme?
A1: No. For someone to join the savings and credit scheme of the group, they should have been a
fully paid-up member of the group for at least 6 months.
Q2: Can one borrow more money from the group fund than their savings?
A2: Yes, one can borrow money beyond their savings. The amount borrowed will depend on factors
such as the statement from the loan guarantor, the purpose of the loan and the report about the
borrower by the loans committee. The next session will address this question in more detail.
Q3: Can one deposit more than the minimum amount?
A3: Yes, a group member can deposit more than the minimum amount.

What is a loan?
A loan or credit is money borrowed by an individual from relatives, friends, groups, moneylenders,
micro-finance institutions (MFIs) or banks in order to meet either social or economic obligations. A
loan is usually paid back over a specified period with or without interest. Loans look attractive
because they do not entail sacrifice and discipline, however loans can prove a burden especially
where collateral is required, loan terms are unfavourable, and when one fails to repay in time.
What are the sources of loans?
 Banks and financial institutions
 Societies and associations
 Friends, relatives and family members
 Suppliers of goods
 Customers
 Government loans
 Farmer groups with savings and credit initiatives

&				
Q1: Can one take out a second loan before completing payment for the preceding loan?
A1: For someone to be eligible for a loan, he or she should not have an outstanding loan.
Q2: If two or more group members decide to form a business partnership, can they be granted a
loan not as individuals but as a partnership?
A2: Yes, this should be possible especially when both members meet all the criteria for accessing the
group loans.
Q3: After completion of a loan repayment, how soon should a member be eligible for another loan?
A3: After completion of the loan repayment, a member should be immediately eligible for another
loan if he or she meets the requirement for borrowing.

be a member of the group is considered enough security.
9. Guarantor: Every loan applicant must provide one guarantor. The proposed guarantor must be a
member the group and an active participant in the groupâ€™s saving programme. The guarantor
must be of good character, must not be a defaulting borrower nor a guarantor to a loan in
default, and not a guarantor to another loan. The guarantor must be someone who can bring
pressure to bear on the borrower to repay the loan and in case of failure, the guarantor must
stand to lose his/her savings and pay for the outstanding loan and interest thereon.
10.Loan repayment schedule: A loan repayment schedule shall be prepared in duplicate and the
borrower shall be given a copy for information and record.
11.Loan processing cycle: Within 7 days of applying, applicants shall be informed about the status


Markets
A market is a platform that brings together buyers and sellers to exchange goods and services.
Marketing consists of all activities involved in moving a product from the point of production to the
point of consumption. In other words, marketing involves all those activities linking producers and
consumers. Successful marketing ensures that products are available:
 In the right place
 In the form wanted
 In the quantities and quality required
 At the time needed
 At the right price.

113

Markets can be classified by:
 Commodities, e.g. banana market, orange market
 Time, e.g. Sunday market, evening or morning market
 Location, e.g. Owino market, Kabalagala market.
What is demand?
Demand can be defined as the amount of a particular product or service which buyers are willing
and able to buy. Demand is not static but constantly changing. Some of the factors affecting demand
are:
 Prices. If prices rise, demand usually falls; if prices fall, demand usually increases.
 Income. When consumersâ€™ income increases, so does their purchasing power and their demand
for various products; when incomes are low, the opposite happens.
 Quality. Buyers are sensitive to the quality of agricultural products. Improvements in quality can
lead to an increase in demand, whereas a decline in quality can have the opposite effect.
What is supply?
Supply can be defined as the amount of a product which producers and market intermediaries are
able to provide. Some of the factors influencing the supply of agricultural products are:
 Climate. Favourable weather conditions will mean a good harvest and increased supply, while
drought or floods will have the opposite effect.
 Pests and diseases can have a similar, negative impact on production and supply.
 Production costs. An increase in the production cost of a certain commodity may lead farmers to
shift to other commodities with better returns. A decline in production costs might have the
opposite effect.
 Prices. If possible, farmers will increase supply when prices rise, and reduce it when prices fall. In
the case of storable crops, such as grains, farmers may be able to respond rapidly to price
increases by releasing stocks.
 Transport infrastructure. An improvement in transport infrastructure can allow farmers to reach
urban markets more easily and increase supply.
What influences the price of a product?
Prices are largely determined by supply and demand. Prices can fluctuate significantly, even during a
single day. If large quantities of a certain product, such as banana, suddenly arrive on the market, for
example during the harvesting period, prices will fall. When there is a shortage of supplies in the
market, for example because of a failed crop, prices will rise. During festive periods like Christmas,
demand for banana expands, leading to an increase in the price. Knowing what is happening with
demand and supply is essential to understand not only short-term and seasonal price variations but
also longer term price trends. Knowledge of supply and demand may even enable farmers to
anticipate future price changes.

114

&				
Q1: How can a farmer tell when the prices of banana are going to increase?
A1: Prices for banana increase for various reasons. During festive seasons, the prices go up because
the demand is high. During drought periods or disease outbreaks, when production is reduced,
prices go up. In general, prices go up when production goes down, or when demand is high.
Q2: There is usually high banana production in November (because of the favourable weather), and
yet the prices are also high around this time â€“ why is this?
A2: The high demand is because of the festive events at this time of year, which increases the prices
even though supply is good.
Q3: At certain times of year we have a lot of banana in our villages, but we canâ€™t sell them outside
the villages because the roads are too bad during the rains. What can we do about this?
A3: You should approach the local leaders to ask the district heads to work on the road so that
buyers can reach you.

What is collective marketing?
Collective marketing is when smallholder farmers join together to bulk their produce for marketing
purposes.
Advantages of collective marketing
 Economies of scale. If farmers combine their produce, they can get better prices from traders
who want to buy larger quantities.
 Cost sharing. Farmers can share costs of, for example, transport to take their produce to more
distant markets, where they may get a better price.
 Reduced transaction costs. If farmers can reach distant markets, the number of middlemen will
be reduced, and this will reduce transaction costs. This will mean better profits for farmers as
well as cheaper prices for consumers.
 Improved quality. Working together, farmers can sort and grade their produce, and sell the
higher quality produce to certain traders who will pay more for it. Also, farmers can work
together to improve the overall quality of their produce, for example through group training in
crop management or pest and disease management.
 Incentive to increase production. As farmers are better able to market their produce, and get
better prices, there will be an incentive for them to increase production to raise their profits.
 Improving access to credit. Farmers are more likely to be given a loan by a bank if they are
working in a group. The group provides collateral for the loan. The group itself can also provide
loans to members if it sets up a savings and credit initiative.
 Communal equipment and services. It is much cheaper and easier for government and
development agencies to organize training and agricultural extension services for groups of
farmers rather than for individual farmers. If all farmers find it difficult to attend training sessions,
individuals from the group can pass on advice and training to their fellow group members. Farm
inputs can also be purchased collectively. It is usually much cheaper to buy tools, seeds and farm
chemicals in bulk.
Challenges of collective marketing
 Regulating the supply of bananas. Collective marketing organizations usually allow members to
contribute as many bananas as they have available. This may cause a problem if the market
becomes saturated, and not all the bananas can be sold.
 Ensuring quality. Some members may contribute bananas of a lower quality than is acceptable,
which can cause tensions in the group.
 Free-riding on othersâ€™ investments. Benefits from investments, such as price information from a
market information system or increased marketing opportunities for the entire group, can
sometimes be taken advantage of by those who did not invest. This can discourage investment.
 Liability. Some buyers might shy away from buying from collective marketing groups because it
could prove to be more difficult to hold a group responsible in case of a breach of the marketing
contract.
 Collective marketing requires accessible collecting centres near the road and these may not be
available or may be expensive.

Q1: If we market as a group, who pays the taxes?
A1: Everyone in the group takes a share of all the costs incurred during the marketing, and this
includes the taxes.
Q2: What if my bananas are ready ahead of the agreed marketing day?
A2: The group should allow you to sell individually if this happens. You should also inform the
groupâ€™s marketing committee.
Q3: Can someone from outside the group join us to sell their bananas?
A3: This will depend on what the group has agreed and written down in its constitution. It may be
useful to be able to invite others to market with you, at times when high volumes are needed.
Q4: Can our group focus on other initiatives alongside banana production and marketing?
A4: This depends on the groupâ€™s desires and objectives. If the group sees other, potentially
profitable opportunities, they might decide to try them. For example, a banana farmersâ€™ group could
sell other crops alongside bananas, and could decide to initiate a credit and savings initiative.
Q5: Sometimes buyers want to buy bananas on credit rather than pay cash. How can we get them to
pay cash?
A5: When you are negotiating marketing agreements with potential buyers, ensure that the terms of
payment are clear, i.e. whether the group can accept credit sales or can only accept cash sales. If you
make an agreement with the buyer to pay cash upon taking the bananas and he or she fails to
comply, then you have a choice to either continue with the marketing agreement or find another
buyer who can pay cash.
Q6: How should we collect the bananas together, since our farms are not in the same place?
A6: The group should decide on a convenient central place which all group members and the buyer
can reach, and meet there on the agreed day to collect and market the bananas.

Market information
Market information is facts and figures that will help farmers, consumers and others involved in the
marketing process to make better decisions and minimize their risks. Market information may
include the price of inputs, the current selling price of produce, potential buyers of the produce,
quantities of produce required by different buyers, etc.
How does market information help farmers?
 Increases farmersâ€™ bargaining power
 Enables farmers to access more markets
 Improves farmersâ€™ decision making in terms of:
â€“ What to produce
â€“ How much to produce
â€“ Price to charge
â€“ How to promote the product
â€“ When and where to sell the product.
Sources of market information for farmers

Traders/buyers

Tips for trainers
Extension workers sometimes try to â€˜pushâ€™ farmers into accepting recommendations. However,
when decisions about what to grow or how to sell are imposed this rarely leads to success. Farmers
do not feel that the decisions are theirs, they are not committed to them and they feel a lower sense
of responsibility. If things do go wrong it is easy for farmers to blame the person who persuaded
them to do the â€˜wrongâ€™ thing.
Helping farmers to make their own decisions is a more difficult and slower process but, in the long
run, it will be more successful than trying to tell farmers what to do. When groups of farmers take
on ownership of their plans they are more enthusiastic, show more determination to overcome
problems and take greater pride if their plan proves successful. They are much more able to
overcome problems in the future and to actively seek solutions for themselves.
To make decisions, farmers must be well informed. They need to know what choices they have. They
will have to discuss what they can do to improve their marketing and agree on what to do and on
who is responsible for the individual tasks. The role of the facilitator is to guide this process by
presenting the results, and letting the farmers take the lead in deciding how they will engage in the
market given the facts presented to them.
It is possible that after conducting this session, farmers decide to opt out of collective marketing.

Contact potential buyers, brief them on the possibility of entering a marketing arrangement with the
farmersâ€™ group, and invite them to the session at the agreed date and time. If they agree to attend,
discuss with them the information they will need to share with the group. Aim for between two and
four potential buyers.
Remind the potential buyers who agreed to attend the session at least 3 days before the meeting,
and reconfirm with them the time and the venue 1 day before the meeting.
Write down on the flipchart the key issues that will be discussed between the farmer group and the
potential buyer during the meeting. These include:
 The banana grading procedure preferred by the buyer
 How often the buyer prefers the group to supply the produce
 The price offered by the buyer for the various grades of banana
 The preferred delivery/collection system, i.e. collection centres or collect from individual farms
 Payment terms, i.e. cash sales, payment by cheque or credit sales.

What is a marketing trial?
A marketing trial allows farmers to try out collective marketing before fully committing to a contract-
based arrangement. The trial allows the group to assess whether they can successfully market
collectively, and to iron out any problems ahead of signing a contract.

Procedure for conducting a marketing trial
1. Farmers volunteer one or two bunches of bananas to be used in the marketing trial. Draw up a
marketing inventory so the group knows who contributed the bananas, and the quantity and
grade.

124

2. The group agrees a price range for each grade of bananas. The group also agrees on the banana
collection centres, depending on which farmers are contributing bananas.
3. Contact the buyer who was selected during the previous session with information about the
quantities of banana, the grades and the collection centre. Invite him or her to come and
purchase the bananas at the agreed time and date.
4. The farmers deliver the agreed quantity and grade of bananas to the collection centre, where the
buyer collects and pays for the bananas. The facilitator should be present when the transaction is
taking effect.
5. The group meets to discuss the success of the marketing trial, and any problems that were
encountered, and discusses ways to improve the arrangements.
