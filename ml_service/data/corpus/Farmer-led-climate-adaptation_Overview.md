Project overview
The Eastern Africa Farmers Federation (EAFF) in collaboration with Accelerating Impacts of
CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA), is implementing a project to showcase best
practice examples of farmer-led adaptation in managing the negative impacts of
climate change on agriculture.
Beginning in April 2024, the EAFF and AICCRA will work towards developing a
compendium of farmer-led best practice case studies that demonstrate innovative
local activities and methods to enhance agricultural adaptation and ultimately promote
resilience across the continent.
These cases will be selected from a variety of geographical regions across Africa
and will vary in their scale, focus and level of ambition. The selection of these innovations
will be done so in collaboration with local partners, including regional farmer
organisations, local communities, NGOs and other appropriate partners.
Farmer-led climate adaptation

What is locally led adaptation?
Locally led adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector refers to
strategies and actions that are designed and implemented at the local
level by farmers and their communities to reduce the risks posed by
climate change and build resilience to its impacts. Among other impacts,
these initiatives can reduce climate-induced drought, unpredictable weather
patterns, reduced soil productivity and reduce the incidence of crop and
livestock diseases.
Please note that the level of analysis for these case studies is local. For
example, the studies will document the activities planning and performed by
individual farmers, farmer households, a single or group of agri-businesses
or a farming community. While farmer-led adaptation is often done in
collaboration with other stakeholders in the local environment, including
community organisations, local governments, civil society organisations,
researchers and other stakeholders, the main project activities must be
driven and led by farmers.
Once the case studies have been jointly identified, EAFF and AICCRA will collaborate
directly with the grassroots level innovators to document their specific activities
and best practices in each unique locality. The project implementers will capture the
details of each innovation and describe how it responds to the changing climate. They
will also describe the lived reality of each context and the key challenges and enabling
factors for the project’s successes and difficulties. In addition, EAFF and AICCRA will
document valuable insights and “key takeaways” and provide recommendations on
their suitability and potential application in other areas, with the hope to replicate and
scale best practices in different regional areas across the continent.
The final output of this project is a publicly accessible compendium of case studies that
will be distributed widely to farmer bodies, policymakers, financers, and community
actors to generate interest and knowledge in these innovative practices; to
share lessons; and to potentially attract partnerships and financial support
for their scaling. In addition, the EAFF and AICCRA will organise workshops and
events to engage further with the project innovators and case studies.

Key aspects of the farmer
led adaptation interventions
•	Participation and ownership:
Farmers are actively involved in
identifying their vulnerabilities
to climate change, determining
appropriate local adaptation
measures, and implementing these
actions. This ensures that the
adaptation strategies are tailored
specifically to farmer needs and
their local context, increasing their
effectiveness and sustainability.
•	Local knowledge and practices:
Locally led adaptation draws on
traditional knowledge and practices
that have been developed and
refined over generations, which are
often highly effective in addressing
local climate challenges. The
approach often involves using the
knowledge that farmers have of their
local environment, in combination
with traditional practices and new
technologies and information, to
adapt farming practices to better
protect their livestock, crops and
livelihoods from climate change.
•	Building resilience: Farmer led
adaptation focuses on enhancing
the resilience of their communities
and ecosystems to climate impacts.
This can include measures that are
beneficial over the long term, such
as improving water management,
diversifying livelihoods, and
enhancing natural resources
management.
•	Empowerment and equity:
Farmer led adaptation aims
to empower people in their
local communities, particularly
marginalised groups such as women,
young people and indigenous
peoples. These activities can help
community members participate in
decision-making processes, build
capacity related to climate relevant
technologies or access resources
to adapt to climate change, which
can help to reduce inequities in
vulnerability and enhance the overall
effectiveness of adaptation efforts.
•	Integration with development
goals: Locally led adaptation
projects contribute to sustainable
development goals and enhance
overall community well-being and
resilience.
TO NOMINATE AN APPROPRIATE INNOVATION IN
YOUR COUNTRY OR REGION, PLEASE CONSIDER THE
FOLLOWING CRITERIA:

Practical examples of farmer led adaptation
•	Crop diversification: Farmers plant a particular variety of crops with different
maturation times and different tolerance to weather extremes and drought. This
can help improve the survival rate of crops in adverse conditions and can spread
the risk in uncertain conditions.
•	Crop breeding: Farmers select and breed seed varieties that are better adapted
to changing climatic conditions. In addition, farmers save and exchange seeds of
traditional varieties that contribute to the conservation of crop genetic diversity.
•	Integrated water management: Farmers build small-scale water harvesting
structures like ponds or tanks that can help conserve water during rainy seasons
in anticipation of drier spells. In addition, farmers employ practices like drip pool
irrigation to improve water use efficiency.
Overall, farmer led adaptation recognises the importance of using their local
knowledge, agency, and context-specific approaches in addressing the
challenges posed by climate change, and these innovations emphasise the
importance of building resilience at the local level.
While farmer led adaptation interventions vary tremendously across
countries and regions, there are some common actions that can be considered
as farmer led adaptation.
Nominated innovations will be reviewed by an expert committee against
the criteria described above. Those that are selected will be documented and
included in a compendium of case studies that will be made publicly available.

•	Agroforestry: Farmers introduce
trees and shrubs into agricultural
landscapes to provide shade, improve
soil fertility, and offer additional
incomes sources through the sale of
timber, fruits and nuts. In addition,
farmers can promote tree regulation,
tree stewardship and cultivation to
ensure greater tree cover through the
cultivation of tree seedlings.
•	Soil conservation: Farmers
implement context-specific practices
like contour ploughing, mulching,
terracing and intercropping that can
reduce soil erosion and improve soil
health.
•	Traditional knowledge
integration: Farmers combine
traditional and modern farming
practices that are effective in dealing
with local climate variability. These
include growing a variety of crops
together, seed saving, terracing, the
use of traditional calendars rituals
and community-based management
systems that incorporate knowledge
about seasonal weather patterns
and agricultural practices. In
addition, farmers use traditional
water management techniques in
combination with modern ones, such
as furrow irrigation, bunyip irrigation
and traditional sprinkler systems.
•	Livestock management: Farmers
alter their animal husbandry
practices, such as adjusting grazing
patterns or providing additional
shading, to help livestock cope better
with extreme weather conditions.
•	Adjustments to herd composition:
Farmers keeping livestock alter the
composition of their herds to adapt
to changing agroecological conditions
(e.g., switching away from cattle to
camels)
•	Agroecological practices: Farmers
employ farming methods that
mimic natural ecosystems, minimise
chemicals and promote efficient
water management. These practices
focus on working with nature and
seek to promote biodiversity, soil
health and ecosystem resilience.
These practices include crop
diversification, agroforestry,
conservation tillage, crop rotation and
integrated pest management, among
others.
•	Early warning systems: Farmers
establish early warning systems
for weather events that can help
them prepare and mitigate potential
losses. These include using weather
forecasts, crop advisories, soil
moisture monitoring, pest and
disease monitoring, and market
monitoring. These early warning
systems are often implemented
through a combination of traditional
knowledge, local expertise, and
modern technologies such as mobile
phones, radio, and internet-based
platforms.
•	Ecosystem conservation and
restoration: Through planting trees
and other vegetation types, farmers
chose to enrich their land through
regenerative and agroecological
methods and shoring up nature-
based infrastructure.

In addition to agricultural practices,
farmer-led adaptation can also include
•	Leadership in mobilising local resources for positive change, such as the
introduction of saving schemes to support climate-resilient practices.
•	Forging of partnerships with a variety of actors to remunerate community members
for their efforts and leverage supplemental resources to scale action on community
resilience priorities. This includes partnering with research for development
organisations for information and data that can inform their decisions on relevant
climate smart agricultural practices.
•	Farmer efforts to mobilise the community and to influence policy and regulatory
change for climate smart agriculture.
•	Farmer initiatives that promote capacity building and knowledge sharing, such as
multistakeholder dialogue platforms.
•	Farmer initiatives that seek to integrate the root causes of climate vulnerability
into their actions, such as gender-based, economic, and political inequalities, are also
important as they encourage vulnerable and marginalized individuals to meaningfully
participate in and lead adaptation decisions.
