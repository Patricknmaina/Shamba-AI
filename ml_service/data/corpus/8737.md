Definition of Terms
Adaptation means adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected
climatic stimuli or their effects which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.
Adaptive capacity refers to the ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms
to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to
consequences (IPCC, 2014, Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) Glossary).
The carbon market is a market that is created from the trading of units of GHG emissions.
A carbon credit or offset is a financial unit of measurement that represents the removal of one
tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent from the atmosphere. Carbon credits are generated by
projects that deliver measurable reductions in GHG emissions.
Climate change means a change in the climate system which is caused by significant changes
in the concentration of greenhouse gases as a consequence of human activities and which is in
addition to natural climate change that has been observed during a considerable period.
Global warming refers to the gradual increase, observed or projected, in global surface
temperature, as one of the consequences of climate change.
The main greenhouse gases that are measured in a GHG inventory are: carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
Mitigation means human interventions that seek to prevent or slow down the increase of
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by limiting current or future emissions and
enhancing potential sinks for greenhouse gases.
MtCO2eq or MtCO2e is an abbreviation for million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, or
the amount of GHG emissions expressed as an equivalent amount or concentration of carbon
dioxide.
REDD+ is the acronym for reducing emissions form deforestation and forest degradation and
the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon
stocks in developing countries. It is a mitigation mechanism that creates a financial value for
the carbon stored in forests by avoiding deforestation and increasing the carbon stock in
existing forests.
Resilience refers to the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with
a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain
their essential function, identity and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for
adaptation, learning and transformation (IPCC, 2014, AR5 Glossary).
Vulnerability refers to the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected.
Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or
susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt. (IPCC, 2014, AR5 Glossary).

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

Executive Summary
Climate change has increased the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events in
Kenya causing loss of lives, diminished livelihoods, reduced crop and livestock production,
and damaged infrastructure, among other adverse impacts. An example is the torrential rains
and severe flooding from March to May 2018 that devastated communities that were already
struggling to recover from a prolonged drought. Climate change is likely to negatively impact
Kenya’s future development and achievement of the goals of Kenya Vision 2030 – the long-
term development blueprint – and the Government’s Big Four agenda for 2018-2022 that
focuses on ensuring food and nutrition security, affordable and decent housing, increased
manufacturing and affordable healthcare.
Kenya takes climate change seriously, as demonstrated by the enactment of the Climate
Change Act (Number 11 of 2016). This Act requires the Government to develop five-year
National Climate Change Action Plans (NCCAP) to guide the mainstreaming of adaptation and
mitigation actions into sector functions of the National and County Governments.
NCCAP 2018-2022 aims to further Kenya’s development goals by providing
mechanisms and measures to achieve low carbon climate resilient development
in a manner that prioritises adaptation.  This plan builds on the first Action Plan (2013-2017)
and provides a framework for Kenya to deliver on its Nationally Determined Contribution
(NDC) under the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC). NCCAP 2018-2022 guides the climate actions of the National and County
Governments, the private sector, civil society and other actors as Kenya transitions to a low
carbon climate resilient development pathway. The NCCAP consists of this Volume I, the
Volume II: Adaptation Technical Analysis Report, and Volume III: Mitigation Technical
Analysis Report.

Kenya’s Changing Climate
Kenya is an equatorial county in East Africa with a complex and variable climate ranging from
warm and humid in the coastal regions to arid and very arid in the interior. The central and
western highlands, bisected by the Rift Valley, have a temperate climate with medium to high
rainfall and are the productive zones with high to medium agricultural potential (about 18%
of Kenya’s land area). Low and unevenly distributed rainfall over much of the country means
about 82% of Kenya receives less than 700 mm of rain per year. Twenty-three of Kenya’s 47
Counties are considered as arid or semi-arid lands (ASALs). Kenya is frequently affected by
weather-related disasters, particularly droughts, which have a profound impact on Kenya’s
economy and people’s well-being.
Kenya’s climate is already changing. Surface temperatures across Africa have increased by 0.5-
2°C over the past 100 years, and from 1950 onward climate change has changed the magnitude
and frequency of extreme weather events. The frequency of cold days, cold nights and frost has
decreased; while the frequency of hot days, hot nights and heat waves has increased.
Temperature increase has been observed across all seasons, but particularly from March to
May.
Rainfall patterns have also changed. The long rainy season has become shorter and drier, and
the short rainy season has become longer and wetter, while overall annual rainfall remains
low. The long rains have been declining continuously in recent decades, and droughts have
become longer and more intense and tend to continue across rainy seasons. The frequency of

rainfall events causing floods has increased in East Africa from an average of less than three
events per year in the 1980s to over seven events per year in the 1990s and 10 events per year
from 2000 to 2006, with a particular increase in floods. Droughts and heavy rainfall have
become more frequent in the last 30 years.
The current trend of rising annual temperatures is expected to continue in Kenya in all
seasons. The precipitation projections are more uncertain and suggest that by the end of the
21st century East Africa will have a wetter climate with more intense wet seasons and less
severe droughts. The proportion of rainfall that occurs in heavy events is expected to increase.

Climate Change Impacts in Kenya
Heat, drought and floods are impacting Kenyans, and human health is increasingly at risk.
Kenya’s economy is very dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water,
energy, tourism, wildlife, and health. The increasing intensity and magnitude of weather-
related disasters in Kenya aggravates conflicts, mostly over natural resources, and contributes
to security threats.
The economic cost of floods and droughts is estimated to create a long-term fiscal liability
equivalent to 2%-2.8% of GDP each year. Specifically, the estimated costs of floods are about
5.5% of GDP every seven years, while droughts account for 8% of GDP every five years.
Floods have led to the greatest loss of human lives in Kenya. The floods in early 2018 claimed
over 183 lives, displaced more than 225,000 people including over 145,000 children, and
closed over 700 schools. The economic impacts of floods are severe; in 2018, rain and flooding
wiped out resources worth billions of shillings. Roads and infrastructure were destroyed,
seasonal crops across an estimated 8,500 hectares of land were destroyed and over 20,000
livestock drowned.
Droughts are typically large-scale disasters in Kenya destroying livelihoods, triggering local
conflicts over scarce resources, and eroding the ability of communities to cope. The 2014-18
drought was declared a national emergency in February 2017 and at that point in time affected
23 ASAL Counties. At least 3.4 million Kenyans were severely food insecure and an estimated
500,000 people did not have access to water.
Sea level rise is impacting coastal towns and communities. Coastal flooding from sea-level
rise is projected to affect up to 86,000 people a year and lead to coastal erosion and wetland
loss at an annual cost of about KES 6 billion by 2030. The National Museums of Kenya is
constructing a KES 500 million sea wall to protect Fort Jesus in Mombasa from erosion
contributed to by rising sea levels and storm surges.
Rising sea temperatures off the coast of Kenya have triggered mass coral bleaching and
mortality on coral reef systems over the past two decades. This impacts the abundance and
composition of fish species and negatively impacts coastal fisheries.
The glaciers of Mount Kenya are declining and are expected to disappear in the next 30
years, largely because of climate change. Mount Kenya is one of the country’s water towers
and a source of numerous rivers and streams.

Kenya’s Contribution to Climate Change
Kenya has little historical or current responsibility for global climate change; the country’s
GHG emissions represent less than 1% of total global emissions. Adaptation is the priority for

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

Kenya, but climate action also needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are projected to
increase because of population and economic growth. Actions in the six mitigation sectors set
out in the UNFCCC – agriculture, energy, forestry, industry, transport, and waste – are
expected to lead to lower emissions than in the projected baseline and help to meet Kenya’s
mitigation NDC to abate GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 relative to the business as usual
scenario. The forestry sector has large potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Kenya
because forests act as “sinks” through carbon sequestration.

Legal and Policy Framework
Climate change is a global problem that demands a global solution, and Kenya is an active
player in international efforts. The international response to climate change is founded upon
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris
Agreement under the UNFCCC aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate
change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2°C above pre-industrial
levels. Kenya’s NDC sets out the country’s actions to contribute to achieving the global goal
set out in the Paris Agreement, and includes mitigation and adaptation contributions. The
Paris Agreement entered into force for Kenya on 27th January 2017, and as set out in Article
2(6) of the Constitution of Kenya (2010), the Paris Agreement now forms part of the law of
Kenya.
At the domestic level, a robust regulatory framework comprising laws, policies, plans and
institutions is being progressively established at the National and County levels to address
climate change. The foundation of the institutional and legal framework for climate change
action is the Constitution of Kenya (2010). Article 10 sets out national values and principles
of governance, such as sustainable development, devolution of government, and public
participation, that are mandatory when making or implementing any law or public policy
decisions, including climate change. Article 42 provides for the right to a clean and healthy
environment for every Kenyan, which includes the right to have the environment protected
for the benefit of present and future generations.
The Climate Change Act, 2016 is the main legislation guiding Kenya’s climate change
response through mainstreaming climate change into sector functions, and it is the legal
foundation of the NCCAP. In addition, Kenya has developed the National Climate Change
Response Strategy (2010), first NCCAP (2013-2017), National Adaptation Plan (NAP 2015-
2030), Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Strategy (2017-2026), Climate Risk Management
Framework (2017), National Climate Change Policy (2018) and National Climate Finance
Policy (2018), among other sector plans and policies that address aspects of climate change.
At the County level, Garissa, Makueni and Wajir Counties have enacted climate change fund
regulations that allocate a portion of their development budgets to County-level funds that
support local adaptation and mitigation actions.

Priority Climate Change Actions
NCCAP 2018-2022 takes cognisance of the impacts of climate change on Kenya’s socio-
economic sectors. It identifies strategic areas where climate action is linked to the Big Four
agenda, recognising that climate change is likely to limit the achievement of these pillars. For
example, food security is threatened through climate change-driven declines in agricultural
productivity, health is impacted by an increase in vector-borne diseases, including malaria and

cholera; housing and manufacturing are impacted by damage to infrastructure (including
homes, business, schools and hospitals) caused by flooding and storm events.

Adaptation actions are prioritised in NCCAP 2018-2022 because of the devastating impacts of
droughts and floods, and the negative effects of climate change on vulnerable groups in society
including women, older members of society, persons with disabilities, children, youth, and
members of minority or marginalised communities. These actions are undertaken, where
possible, in a way to limit greenhouse gas emissions to ensure that the country achieves its
mitigation NDC. The climate change actions will be mainstreamed in the Third Medium Term
Plan and in Country Integrated Development Plans, ensuring that strategic climate change
actions are taken up across the country and in all sectors.

Delivering the NCCAP
The Climate Change Act, 2016 sets out institutional structures and responsibilities that guide
the oversight and management of NCCAP 2018-2022. The National Climate Change Council,
chaired by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Kenya and co-chaired by the Deputy
President, is responsible for overall coordination of climate change affairs, including guiding
the implementation of NCCAP 2018-2022.
The Cabinet Secretary responsible for climate change affairs submits the action plan to the
Council for approval, and reports to the Council and Parliament on the status of the
implementation of this NCCAP. The Climate Change Directorate, established in the ministry
responsible for climate change affairs, coordinates the implementation of NCCAP 2018-2022,
including related monitoring and reporting.
State departments and national public entities are required to establish climate change units
to integrate NCCAP 2018-2022 into strategies and implementation plans, and to report to the
Council on an annual basis on performance and implementation.
County Governments are responsible for integrating and mainstreaming climate change
actions into their 2018-2022 County Integrated Development Plans, designating a County
Executive Committee member to coordinate climate change affairs, and reporting annually to
the County Assemblies on the implementation of climate change. County governments are
expected to establish climate change units that will oversee the implementation of climate
actions.

Chapter 1: Introduction and Situational Analysis

1.1
Introduction
Climate change has increased the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events in
Kenya that have led to loss of lives, diminished livelihoods, reduced crop and livestock
production, and damaged infrastructure, among other adverse impacts. An example is the
torrential rains and severe flooding from March to May 2018 that devastated communities
that were already struggling to recover from a prolonged drought. Climate change is likely to
negatively impact Kenya’s future development and achievement of the goals of Kenya Vision
2030 – the long-term development blueprint – and the Government’s Big Four agenda for
2018-2022 which focuses on ensuring food and nutrition security, affordable and decent
housing, increased manufacturing and affordable healthcare.
Kenya takes climate change seriously, as demonstrated by the enactment of the Climate
Change Act (Number 11 of 2016). This is the first climate change-dedicated legislation in
Africa, and provides a regulatory framework for an enhanced response to climate change. It
provides mechanisms and measures to transition to a low carbon climate resilient
development (see Box 1). This pathway emphasises sustainable development and prioritises
adaptation, recognising the importance of increasing the climate resilience of vulnerable
groups including women, youth, people with disabilities, and marginalised and minority
communities.

Box 1: Kenya’s low carbon climate resilient development pathway
A low carbon climate resilient development pathway for Kenya emphasises:
▪
Sustainable Development – Achieving sustainable development is at the forefront of all climate
actions; climate change and development are intricately linked.
▪
Adaptation – Reducing vulnerability to avoid or cushion the impacts of climate change, and to enable
people to respond to climate risks by moving toward a climate resilient society.
▪
Mitigation – Taking actions, where possible, to encourage greenhouse gas emissions that are lower
than business-as-usual practice; and to reduce the human causes of emissions by moving toward a
resource efficient economy that is as low carbon as possible. Mitigation or low carbon actions should
only be considered as priority climate change actions if they also have climate resilience or significant
sustainable development benefits.
Source: Kenya’s National Climate Change Action Plan, 2013-2017, page 25.

Section 13 of the Climate Change Act, 2016 provides for the development of National Climate
Change Action Plans (NCCAP) to prescribe measures and mechanisms to mainstream
adaptation and mitigation actions into sector functions of National and County Governments.
The Act requires that the Cabinet Secretary responsible for climate change affairs review and
update the NCCAP in every five-year period.
NCCAP 2018-2022 is Kenya’s second action plan on climate change. This plan builds on the
first Action Plan (2013-2017) where considerable progress was made, including establishing
climate change funds in five Counties, expanding geothermal power, establishing the National

Climate Change Resource Centre, and improving the legal and policy framework (see Section
1.4 for more details). NCCAP 2018-2022 is a framework for Kenya to deliver on its Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Climate change is a shared responsibility between the National Government and the County
Governments. The National Government led and guided the process to develop NCCAP 2018-
2022 working with County Governments. The implementation of the plan is coordinated by
the two levels of government in line with the Constitution of Kenya (2010). NCCAP 2018-2022
coincides with the second generation of County Governments, who are responsible for several
devolved functions where action will contribute to the achievement of this climate change
action plan and the Big Four agenda.
NCCAP 2018-2022 guides the climate actions of the National Government, the County
Governments, the private sector, civil society and other actors as Kenya transitions to a low
carbon climate resilient development pathway.

1.2
Goal of NCCAP 2018-2022
Kenya’s National Climate Change Action Plan is a five-year plan that helps Kenya adapt to
climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. NCCAP 2018-2022 aims to further
Kenya’s development goals by providing mechanisms and measures to achieve
low carbon climate resilient development in a manner that prioritises adaptation.
This climate change Action Plan helps further Kenya’s development aspirations and seeks to:
▪ Align climate change actions with the Government’s development agenda, including
the Big Four.
▪ Encourage participation of the private sector, civil society, and vulnerable groups
within society, including women, older members of society, persons with disabilities,
children, youth, and members of minority or marginalised communities.
▪ Provide the framework to deliver Kenya’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
for the five-year period 2018-2022.
▪ Provide a framework for mainstreaming climate change into sector functions at the
national and county level.
In order to achieve climate change action that simultaneously advances economic and
sustainable development objectives, the NCCAP is guided by the following principles:
▪ Responsiveness – responds to actual adaptation and mitigation needs in Kenya by
taking measures to reduce the adverse effects of climate change and prevent or
minimise the causes of climate change.
▪ Equity and social inclusion – addresses the needs of vulnerable groups within society,
including women, older members of society, persons with disabilities, children,
youth, and members of minority or marginalised communities through an inclusive
approach to climate change action.
▪ Consultation and cooperation – implements actions through consultation and
cooperation between the National Government and County Governments, as well as
consultation and cooperation with civil society and the private sector.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

▪ Fairness – ensures that climate actions do not create competitive disadvantage for
the Kenyan private sector relative to its trading partners.
The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF) led the development of NCCAP 2018-2022
through the NCCAP Task Force that was gazetted by the Cabinet Secretary. The Task Force
was comprised of experts from National and County Governments, civil society and the private
sector; and supported by the Adaptation and Mitigation Thematic Working Groups that
developed the Adaptation Technical Analysis Report (ATAR): Volume II and Mitigation
Technical Analysis Report (MTAR): Volume III that are part of NCCAP 2018-2022. The
Climate Change Directorate (CCD) situated in MEF led the technical analysis and held
extensive consultations to ensure that NCCAP 2018-2022 reflects the inputs and priorities of
a range of stakeholders (see Box 2).

Box 2:  Development of the NCCAP 2018-2022 – Stakeholder consultations
The climate change actions in this NCCAP were identified through extensive consultations with over 1,000
stakeholders from:
▪ Departmental Committee on Environment and Natural Resources – National Assembly
▪ Senate Standing Committee on Land, Environment and Natural Resources
▪ National Government sector ministries and state departments
▪ County Governments and Council of Governors
▪ Civil society
▪ Youth
▪ Women
▪ Vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities, pastoralists, fisher communities and forest
resource users
▪ Private sector
▪ Development partners

1.3
Situational Analysis
Kenya is a commercial, transportation and communications hub for eastern Africa. An
estimated 50 million Kenyans (about 52% women and 48% men) live in a country  that has
experienced moderate economic growth over the past five years and seen improved indicators
of human development in such areas as education and declining birth rates.1 In 2016 Kenya
was the ninth-largest economy in Africa and a lower middle-income country with a gross
national income (GNI) per capita of US$1,380.2 About 45% of the population lives below the
poverty line; with poverty being slightly higher in female-headed households.3 Fifty-four
percent of rural and 63% of urban women and girls are estimated to live below the poverty
line, making them more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.4
Kenya is an equatorial country in East Africa with a complex and variable climate ranging from
warm and humid in the coastal regions to arid and very arid in the interior. The central and
western highlands, bisected by the Rift Valley, have a temperate climate with medium to high
rainfall and are the productive zones with high to medium agricultural potential (about 18%
of Kenya’s land area). Low and unevenly distributed rainfall over much of the country means

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

10

about 82% of Kenya receives less than 700 mm of rain per year (see Figure 1). Twenty-three
of Kenya’s 47 Counties are considered as arid or semi-arid lands (ASALs). The arid Counties
are predominantly pastoral; and the semi-arid Counties are mainly agro-pastoral with
integrated crop/livestock production systems.5

Figure 1: The distribution of annual rainfall in Kenya

Kenya is frequently affected by weather-related disasters, particularly droughts, which have a
profound impact on Kenya’s economy and people’s well-being. Floods are seasonal and more
localised, mostly affecting areas around the Lake Victoria Basin and Tana River drainage
basin, and coastal settlements. Flooding can occur across the country in years of above-normal
rainfall and heavy rainfall storms, such as 2018 that saw some of the highest level of rainfall
totals in the long rain season (March-April-May) recorded since 1950.6

1.3.1 Kenya’s Changing Climate
Kenya’s climate is already changing. The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presents strong evidence that surface temperatures across
Africa have increased by 0.5-2°C over the past 100 years, and from 1950 onward climate
change has changed the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events.7 The frequency

of cold days, cold nights and frost has decreased; while the frequency of hot days, hot nights
and heat waves has increased. Temperature increase has been observed across all seasons (see
Figure 2), but particularly from March to May. Variation between locations has occurred, with
a lower rate of warming along the coast.8 Surface temperature trends of Nairobi and its
environs show warming of more than 2.5°C in the past 50 years.9

RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. PRISE Research Brief.

Rainfall patterns have also changed. The long rainy season has become shorter and drier, and
the short rainy season has become longer and wetter, while overall annual rainfall remains
low. The long rains have been declining continuously in recent decades, and droughts have
become longer and more intense and tend to continue across rainy seasons. The frequency of
rainfall events causing floods has increased in East Africa from an average of less than three
events per year in the 1980s to over seven events per year in the 1990s and 10 events per year
from 2000 to 2006, with a particular increase in floods.10 Droughts and heavy rainfall have
become more frequent in eastern Africa in the last 30-60 years.11
The current trend of rising annual temperatures is expected to continue in Kenya in all
seasons. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report noted that during this century, temperatures in
the African continent are likely to rise more quickly than other land areas, particularly in more
arid regions. Climate modelling for the East Africa region using a high-emissions scenario
suggests that mean annual temperatures will increase by 0.9°C by 2035, 2.2°C by 2065 and
4.0°C by 2100.12

The IPCC reports that precipitation projections are more uncertain than temperature
projections, and suggest that by the end of the 21st century East Africa will have a wetter
climate with more intense wet seasons and less severe droughts. The proportion of rainfall
that occurs in heavy events is expected to increase. Regional climate model studies suggest
drying over most parts of Kenya in August and September by the end of the 21st century.13

1.3.2 Climate Change Impacts in Kenya
Climate change is causing an increase in average global temperatures an rising sea levels,
causing significant environmental and economic disruption. Heat, drought and floods are
impacting Kenyans, and human health is increasingly at risk. Kenya’s economy is very
dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, energy, tourism, wildlife,
and health, which increases vulnerability (see Table 1 for other sources of vulnerability). The
increasing intensity and magnitude of weather-related disasters in Kenya aggravates conflicts,
mostly over natural resources, and contributes to security threats.
Historically, extreme climatic events have caused significant loss of life and adversely affected
the national economy. In the 1997-2016 period, the country experienced an average of 57.95
deaths per year and GDP losses of 0.362% per year due to extreme weather events.14

water resources
• Insecure land tenure and land fragmentation
• Population growth and migration to urban areas
• Heavy disease burden and limited access to quality
health care, particularly in rural and remote areas

Social Impacts
Floods have led to the greatest loss of human lives in Kenya. The floods in early 2018
claimed over 183 lives, displaced more than 225,000 people including over 145,000 children,
and closed over 700 schools.15 The floods led to cholera outbreaks in at least five Counties, and
people experienced an upsurge of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue
fever.16 Between 1990 and 2015, a total of 43 flood disasters were recorded in Kenya, which is
equivalent to an average of 1.65 flood disasters per year. On average, each flood disaster
affected 68,000 people.17
An estimated 267,000 Kenyans will be at risk of coastal flooding by 2030 because of sea
level rise; an increase of 30 centimetres is capable of submerging Mombasa and 17% of coastal
areas.18 The coast area has the largest seaport in East Africa and supports tourism and fishing
industries.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

Droughts in Kenya affect about 4.8 million people on average.19 Droughts have destroyed
livelihoods, triggered local conflicts over scarce resources and eroded the ability of
communities to cope. The 2014-18 drought was declared a national emergency in
February 2017 and at that point in time affected 23 of 47 Counties in the ASALs. At least 3.4
million Kenyans were severely food insecure and an estimated 500,000 people did not have
access to water.20 An estimated 482,882 children mainly from 23 ASAL Counties required
treatment for acute malnutrition, and school attendance figures dropped in Counties impacted
by drought.21 Drought can cause changes in the migratory patterns of animals and increase
conflicts between people and large mammals such as elephants.
From a geographical perspective, Kenya’s ASALs are particularly vulnerable to the impacts
of climate change. The highest incidence of poverty is found in these areas and women and
men experience greater competition over resources, rising populations and in-migration from
the densely-populated highlands, and lower access to infrastructure such as potable water,
electricity and telecommunication facilities.22 The ASAL economy is highly dependent on
climate sensitive activities, supporting more than 70% of the national livestock population and
90% of the wildlife that is the mainstay of the tourism sector.23
Cross-border and cross-county conflict can be exacerbated by climate change. As
temperatures rise and rainfall patterns change, some areas become less conducive for
livestock, particularly cattle, leading to a reduction in herd numbers. Those counties with
favourable conditions, such as Laikipia, could enter into resource use conflicts as pastoralists
from other counties move their animals to water and better pasture conditions.24 Cross border
conflicts could increase with other countries, such as Ethiopia and Tanzania, as pastoralists
compete for food, water and grazing lands.
There is evidence of migration linked to climate change in Kenya, mainly because
vulnerable groups are reliant on resource-based livelihoods. Reduced agricultural productivity
is a main force behind rural-urban migration and settling in risk-prone areas and informal
settlements. Resource scarcity, which often intermingles with historical land conflicts, can
lead to displacement. Floods, droughts, and landslides also contribute to movement of
people.25
Vulnerable groups include remote and pastoralist communities, hunters and gatherers,
and fisher communities that are affected by climate change because of environmental
degradation and growing competition for land and water.26 Persons with disabilities, children
and the elderly are vulnerable because of potential impacts on health and their more limited
mobility. Many artisanal fisher communities suffer from severe poverty and are impacted by
more severe storms and heavy rainfall causing rough seas, especially in the May-June-July
period when they are unable to fish or risk their lives attempting to earn income. Concern has
also been expressed regarding the vulnerability of the poor who live in urban slums.
Women are vulnerable to climate change. Their role as primary caregivers and providers of
food and fuel makes them more vulnerable when flooding and drought occur. Drought
compromises hygiene for girls and women as the little water available is used for drinking and
cooking, and has a negative effect on women’s time management in the household. When
nearby wells and waters sources run dry, women have to travel long distances to search for
water. Longer dry seasons mean that women work harder to feed and care for their families.
In both urban and rural areas, women have multiple demands in the home, workplace and
community that leave less time for political involvement and active participation in decision-
making processes. Women in traditional communities may be subject to cultural beliefs that

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

14

deny equal opportunities and rights. Women are more likely to experience poverty, less likely
to own land and have less socioeconomic power than men. This makes it difficult to recover
from climate disasters that affect infrastructure, jobs and housing.

Environmental Impacts
Droughts are typically large-scale disasters in Kenya. The International Disaster Database
reported that a total of ten droughts occurred in Kenya between 1990 and 2015, or one every
2.5 years. An assessment of the 2017 long rain season in ASAL Counties conducted by the
Kenya Food Security Steering Group found that spatial and temporal distribution of rain was
poor across the country. The rains began late across most of the country, resulting in a
shortened rainy season, and most areas received 50-90% of normal rainfall.27
Rising sea temperatures in the Western Indian Ocean influence the coastal conditions
associated with Kenya. The IPCC reports that sea temperatures have increased by 0.60°C over
1950-2009, triggering mass coral bleaching and mortality on coral reef systems over the past
two decades. This is likely to change the abundance and composition of fish species, with a
negative impact on coastal fisheries.28
Rising sea levels are a concern for Kenya’s coastline consisting of mangroves, coral reefs,
sea grass and rocky, sandy and muddy shores. The IPCC reports that over the period 1901-
2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 metres, a result of thermal expansion of the ocean
due to warming plus the addition of water from the loss of mass by melting glaciers and ice
sheets. The annual rise over the past 20 years has been 3.2 millimetres per year, roughly twice
the average speed of the earlier 80 years. Globally, sea levels are projected to rise from 26 to
82 cm by the 2080s.29 The rate of sea level rise along Africa’s Indian Ocean coast is projected
to be greater than the global average. This will lead to greater levels of and more frequent
coastal flooding, changing patterns of shoreline erosion, increased salinity of coastal aquifers,
and modification of coastal ecosystems such as beaches, coral reefs and mangroves.30
Ocean acidification refers to a reduction in the pH of the ocean over an extended period of
time caused mainly by the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The IPCC reports
that the ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide, causing
seawater to become more acidic.31 Ocean acidification is expected to impact many ocean
species, leading to declines with negative impacts on fisher communities that rely on these
species for food and livelihoods. Marine species that are dependent on calcium carbonate to
build their shells and skeletons, such as corals, are highly vulnerable. Little is actually known
about ocean acidification in the Western Indian Ocean because long-term observations and
relevant experiments have not been carried out.32 Research is underway to determine the
economic and social impacts of ocean acidification on coastal communities and fisheries in
Kenya.33
The glaciers of Mount Kenya are declining and are expected to disappear in the next 30
years, largely because of climate change. The Lewis Glacier shrunk by 23% in the six years
from 2004 to 2010, and the Gregory Glacier disappeared. 34 The ice volume of Lewis Glacier
decreased from about 7.7 km3 in 1978 to about 0.3 km3 in 2004 with an average thickness loss
of almost one metre of ice per year.35 The glaciers are melting because of a lack of precipitation
(diminished snowfall on the mountain peaks) to sustain the glaciers. Mount Kenya is one of
the country’s water towers and the source of numerous rivers and streams.

Desertification in the ASALs can be attributed to climate change impacts, in addition to
human activities. It is intensifying and spreading, reducing the productivity of the land and
negatively affecting communities.36 Climate change is also a major factor contributing to land
degradation, which encompasses changes in the chemical, physical and biological properties
of the soil. However, human activities pose the greatest threat through unsustainable land
management practices such as destruction of natural vegetation, over-cultivation, over grazing
and deforestation.37 Restoration of degraded land aims to achieve land degradation neutrality
that maintains or enhances the land resource base – or the stocks of natural capital associated
with the land resources and the ecosystem services that flow from them. Restoration of
degraded land has important climate benefits, including the sequestration of carbon dioxide
and improved climate resilience by recovering lost ecosystems. Kenya launched an ambitious
land restoration programme in 2016 that targets restoration of 5.1 million hectares of
degraded and deforested landscapes by 2030.38
Climate change is contributing to a loss of Kenya’s biodiversity. The Inter-Governmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services reported that climate change
is likely to result in significant losses of many African plant species, some animal species, and
a decline in the productivity of fisheries in inland waters of Africa during the 21st century.39
Dozens of animals died in 2017 as a result of lack of water and pasture in national parks and
reserves, a direct impact of the ongoing drought. Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) reported that
in some years, more animals die from drought than poaching in Kenya.40 Climate change has
the potential to alter migratory routes and timings of species that use seasonal wetlands (such
as migratory birds) and track seasonal changes in vegetation (such as herbivores). Climate
change significantly affects marine ecosystems and will lead to large-scale shifts in the
patterns of marine productivity, biodiversity, community composition and ecosystem
structure.41
Deforestation and forest degradation in Kenya is largely a result of human activities,
although climate change is likely to affect the growth, composition and regeneration capacity
of forests resulting in reduced biodiversity and capacity to deliver important forest goods and
services. Rising temperatures and long periods of drought will lead to more frequent and
intense forest fires, rising temperatures will extend the ecosystem range of pests and
pathogens with consequences on tree growth, survival, yield and quality of wood and non-
wood products, and rising sea levels could submerge mangrove forests in low-lying coastal
areas.42 Kenya lost about 12,000 ha of forest annually from 1990 to 2005 through
deforestation, and the 12% forest cover at Independence in 1963 had been reduced to about
6.9% in 2017 due to population pressure for settlements, infrastructure, demand for wood
products and conversion to agriculture.43 Deforestation is a major cause of climate change
because clearing forests releases huge amounts of greenhouse gases.
Other climate-related hazards in Kenya include landslides and forest fires. Landslides are
largely associated with heavy rainfall in regions with steep slopes, such as Murang’a County,
the western Counties, and the north Rift Valley.44

Economic Impacts
The economic cost of floods and droughts is estimated to create a long-term fiscal liability
equivalent to 2%-2.8% of GDP each year.45 Specifically, the estimated costs of floods are about
5.5% of GDP every seven years, while droughts account for 8% of GDP every five years.46

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

The economic impacts of floods are severe; in 2018, rain and flooding wiped out resources
worth billions of shillings. Roads and infrastructure were destroyed, seasonal crops across an
estimated 8,500 ha of land were destroyed and over 20,000 livestock drowned. The
Government allocated over KES  75 billion to combat floods and fix roads destroyed by the
rains.47 The El Niño induced floods in 1997/1998 caused losses and damages of between
US$ 800 million and US$ 1.2 billion.48
Droughts have had the greatest economic impact – on average, a 0.6 percentage point decline
in GDP growth is observed in Kenya in years of poor rains (see Figure 3).49 The agriculture
sector grew by 1.6% in 2017, compared to 4.7% in 2016, because drought suppressed
production of crops and adversely affected livestock production.50 The drought depressed
generation of hydroelectricity leading to an increase in generation of electricity from thermal
sources that are more costly and produce greenhouse gas emissions. From 2007 to 2017, losses
in livestock populations due to drought-related causes amounted to nearly US$ 1.08 billion.51
The 2008-2011 drought was estimated to have cost the Kenyan economy KES 968.6 billion:
KES 64.4 billion for the destruction of physical assets and KES 904.1 billion for losses in the
flows of the economy. Along with other internal and external shocks, the severe droughts
between 2008 and 2011 contributed to the reduction in Kenya's GDP growth rate from an
average of 6.5% in 2006/2007 to an average of 3.8% between 2008 and 2012.52

The impacts of drought are felt at the household level and are particularly devastating for
pastoralists in the ASALs where livestock production – and specifically, semi-nomadic
pastoralism –  is the key income source.  The share of livestock income in total household
economic income ranges from 25% to 80% in Mandera, Marsabit, Turkana, and Wajir (with
the share larger for poorer families). Drought can weigh heavily on pastoralists because
animals often perish; over 70% of livestock mortality in the ASALs is caused by drought. As a
result, droughts cause significant disruptions in income streams and loss of assets. Kenya risks
losing about 1.7 million cattle, or 52% of the total cattle population in ASALs in the next ten
years because of drought and the effects of climate change. Livestock farmers risk losing
between KES 34 to KES 68 billion in the ten-year period, with the largest impacts in Garissa,
Wajir, Tana River, and Turkana.53

Sea level rise is impacting coastal towns and communities. The National Museums of Kenya is
constructing a KES 500 million sea wall to protect Fort Jesus in Mombasa from erosion caused
by rising sea levels and storm surges.54 Coastal flooding from sea-level rise is projected to affect
10,000–86,000 people a year as well as lead to coastal erosion and wetland loss at an annual
cost of US$ 7–58 million by 2030, rising to US$ 31–313 million by 2050.55
The expected impacts of climate change by sector are elaborated in the ATAR and summarised
in Table 2.

1.3.3 Kenya’s Contribution to Climate Change
The amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) that humans release has increased every year since
the Industrial Revolution and is now at record levels. As carbon dioxide and other GHGs build
up in the atmosphere, they trap heat causing climate change. Kenya has little historical or
current responsibility for global climate change; the country’s GHG emissions represent less
than 1% of total global emissions. While adaptation is the priority for Kenya, action is needed
to reduce GHG emissions that are projected to increase due to population and economic
growth (see Figure 4). Kenya’s mitigation actions help to keep GHG emissions lower than the
projected trajectory and deliver co-benefits including sustainable development, green growth
and resource efficiency. The low-carbon actions also contribute to achieving the Government’s
Big Four agenda.

Actions in the six mitigation sectors set out in the UNFCCC – agriculture, energy, forestry,
industry, transport, and waste – lead to lower emissions than in the projected baseline and
help to meet Kenya’s mitigation NDC. The forestry sector has large potential to reduce GHG
emissions in Kenya because forests act as “sinks” through carbon sequestration (see the green
wedge in Figure 5).

Summary of Implementation of NCCAP (2013-2017)
The Government of Kenya made substantial progress in implementing its first NCCAP (2013-
2017), helping the country deliver on domestic goals and international obligations under the
UNFCCC. The first NCCAP identified 38 priority actions, which included nine mitigation
actions and 29 enabling actions in the areas of climate finance, knowledge management,
legislation and policy, and performance measurement. Nineteen actions were in progress as
of May 2017, and many are carried over to this second NCCAP (2018-2022). Six actions did
not progress, with five of these under the National Performance and Benefit Measurement
subcomponent.56

1.4.1 Progress on Adaptation

Priority adaptation actions were summarised in NCCAP 2013-2017
and further elaborated in the National Adaptation Plan (NAP 2015-
2030). Over the five-year period from 2013-2017 the Government of
Kenya and its partners took action to reduce vulnerability and build
adaptive capacity, with an emphasis on disaster risk reduction,
humanitarian action, preparedness and response actions, and other
priorities identified in the NAP.57 Adaptation actions have not yet
been reviewed in detail given that only two years have passed since
the approval of the plan.
At the national level, many actions were undertaken through the National Drought
Management Authority (NDMA), including Ending Drought Emergencies, the establishment
of the National Drought Emergency Fund, and initiatives in the ASALs to help the most
vulnerable in times of drought. The coping strategies of the poorest people in Turkana, Wajir,
Mandera, Marsabit and other ASAL Counties were improved through the provision of support
during droughts.
Adaptation actions supported by Development Partners focused on adaptation within the
agricultural sector, including irrigation projects, enhancing the climate resilience of
pastoralists, and sustainable land management. Considerable progress was made in
improving access to climate information, providing loans for smallholder farmers to invest in
resources to increase climate resilience, and establishing insurance schemes for smallholder
farmers.
Initiatives also improved climate risk management and natural resource-related knowledge in
the ASALs, and built the capacity of government to enable adaptation. Kenya also made
considerable progress on increasing availability of freshwater sources and improving the
resilience of water towers.
Action at the community level was supported through the Integrated Programme to Build
Resilience to Climate Change and Adaptive Capacity of Vulnerable Communities in Kenya that
was supported by the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund and implemented by the National
Environment Management Authority (NEMA) in its role as National Implementing Entity
(NIE) to the Adaptation Fund. The initiative focused on food security, water management,
coastal ecosystem management and environmental management.
Many County Governments integrated climate change in their 2013 County Integrated
Development Plans (CIDPs), acknowledging that climate change poses threats to sustainable

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

21

development.58 Garissa, Makueni and Wajir County Governments passed regulations to
establish county climate change funds (see Box 3). Climate change fund legislation was
developed in Isiolo and Kitui and was awaiting approval of County assemblies as of June 2018.
Other County Governments, such as Kisumu, established institutional structures to
mainstream climate change in plans and programmes.

Box 3: County Climate Change Funds
Five County Governments – Garissa, Isiolo, Kitui, Makueni and Wajir – have established County Climate
Change Funds (CCCFs) that identify, prioritise and finance investments to reduce climate risk and achieve
adaptation priorities. Community-level planning committees identify adaptation needs, guided by
transparent decision-making criteria. CCCF investments to build climate resilience have largely focused on
livestock, water, natural resource governance and climate information services.
The CCCFs work through the government’s established planning and budgeting systems; and will be linked
with the Climate Change Fund established under the Climate Change Act (2016). The County funds are
structured to blend resources from international climate finance, development partners, the private sector,
National Government and County budgets.
Climate change fund legislation was enacted in Makueni, Wajir and Garissa Counties in 2015, 2016 and 2018
respectively. Makueni’s regulations mandate that the County Government set aside 1% of its annual
development budget for climate change; and the legislation in Wajir and Garissa  requires an annual allocation
of 2%. This amounts to approximately KES 85 million in the 2017/18 fiscal year for Wajir and KES 75 million in
Makueni.

The private sector was an active partner in adaptation, providing technologies, insurance
products and climate information services, many of which are facilitated by smart phone
applications. Various companies have worked to build the climate resilience of farmers in their
supply chains.

1.4.2 Progress on Mitigation
NCCAP 2013-2017 identified six priority action areas for emission reductions and identified
quick-win actions required to begin the process of meeting the long-term goals. These short-term
actions included the development of funding proposals and improving the measurement of GHG
emissions and sinks. A key quick-win achievement was the approval of a grant of Euro 20 million
from the International Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) Facility for Nairobi’s
Bus Rapid Transit system that will be implemented under the second NCCAP 2018-2022.
While reducing GHG emissions is critical, Kenya prioritised mitigation actions that have
adaptation and sustainable development benefits. An example is the forestry sector, where
actions to sequester carbon such as reforestation bring development benefits including
protection of watersheds and improved livelihoods. MEF and Kenya Forestry Service (KFS)
worked with County Governments and private land holders to plant trees and develop
Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation,
sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing
countries (REDD+) actions.
Electricity generation from geothermal energy reduced GHG emissions and lessened the
vulnerability of the sector to climate change. Total installed geothermal capacity at the end of

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

22

2016 was about 630 MW, an increase of about 380 MW from the reported 250 MW of
geothermal power generation in June 2013.59 In 2016/2017, installed capacity was 2,333 MW,
with geothermal accounting for 44% of the electricity  generation mix, hydro 33%, thermal 21%
and imports 2%.60 Renewable energy capacity was increased under the first action plan through
geothermal projects in Olkaria, wind projects in Turkana and Ngong Hills, and several
decentralized energy projects, such as mini-grids and solar photovoltaic systems for off-grid
public schools.
The private sector was a critical partner, with companies generating electricity using renewable
energy (such as solar, biogas and bagasse), manufacturing solar panels and establishing pay-as-
you-go solar lighting systems for households. The Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM)
worked with the Ministry of Energy to support energy audits and efficiency improvements to
reduce GHG emissions, and the cement sector introduced energy efficiency and process
improvements. Efforts to reduce energy demand at the household level included improved
cookstoves, biogas and solar lighting.
Action to reduce emissions in the transport sector included the completion of the Mombasa-
Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) that encouraged a shift of freight from road to rail. The
requirement for all containers for Nairobi and beyond to use the inland container depot at
Embakasi is expected to move 40% of container freight from trucks to the SGR.
Kenya was an active player in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and registered 16
CDM projects and 16 Programmes of Activities in such sectors as reforestation, energy
efficiency, geothermal, wind and hydro. Kenya was active in the voluntary carbon market
hosting the Kasigau Wildlife Corridor REDD project, the first activity to issue voluntary
forestry carbon credits, and the Kenya Agriculture Carbon project, the first project in Africa to
issue carbon credits for sequestering carbon in soil.

1.4.3 Progress on Enabling Actions
NCCAP 2018-2022 builds on the foundation established through enabling actions
implemented under the first action plan (summarised in Box 4). A key accomplishment was
the enactment of the Climate Change Act, 2016, which provides the regulatory framework for
an enhanced response to climate change and provides for mainstreaming approaches for a low
carbon climate resilient pathway. The National Climate Change Policy (2018) was approved
by Parliament, the Climate Change Directorate was put in place, and the National Climate
Change Resource Centre established.

1.4.3 Lessons Learned
Lessons learned while implementing the NCCAP 2013-2017 guided the development of
NCCAP 2018-2022.61 These lessons included:
▪
Focus on adaptation and mitigation actions. The enabling actions underpin and
support the achievement of adaptation and mitigation goals. Ensure that priority
actions are identified for agriculture, clean energy, biodiversity conservation and use,
and disaster risk reduction.
▪
Ensure that the NCCAP addresses the issues of vulnerable groups, including
women, older members of society, persons with disabilities, children, youth, and
members of minority and marginalised communities.
▪
The robust legal framework established through the Climate Change Act,
2016 encourages mainstreaming, which is essential for effective implementation
of NCCAP 2018-2022. Kenya’s Third Medium Term Plan (MTP III) includes climate
change as a crosscutting issue, and climate change is mainstreamed in the relevant
sectors.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

24

▪
Effective coordination of climate change action is an important element of
success. The Climate Change Act, 2016 defines a coordination role that is overseen by
the National Climate Change Council and delivered by the CCD.
▪
Ensure the process to develop the NCCAP includes adequate consultation.
Climate change is a cross-cutting issue with impacts across sectors. Consultations
enable views and perspectives to be expressed by individuals and representatives of
communities, Counties, business associations, civil society and vulnerable members of
society.
▪
Engagement of County Governments is critical to ensure ownership and buy-in.
Many of the actions will be delivered at the County level and the inputs of the Counties
have informed the development of NCCAP 2018-2022.
▪
Reporting on climate actions needs to account for devolution and the role of State
Departments and Counties, as set out in the Climate Change Act.
▪
An appropriate Measurement, Reporting and Verification Plus (MRV+)
system that includes adaptation and mitigation can be introduced in a
phased approach over 2018-2022. The NCCAP 2018-2022 actions should lead to
adaptation or mitigation benefits that can be measured, with baseline information and
SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and within a specific time frame)
indicators. National level indicators can be identified to provide a snapshot of progress
on climate change (such as number of people receiving drought relief payments,
percentage of renewable energy in the electricity mix). Enhanced data collection and
management can improve reporting on climate results.

Chapter 2:  Enabling Legal and Policy Framework

2.1
The Global Context
Climate change is a global problem which demands a global solution, and Kenya is an active
player in international efforts. The international response to climate change is founded upon
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that
entered into force in 1994. Kenya signed the UNFCCC on 12th June 1992 and ratified the
Convention on 30th August 1994. Kenya is a key player in the global climate change
governance system and participates in the meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to
the UNFCCC, articulating the national interest and the country’s position during
international negotiations.
The objective of the UNFCCC is set out in Article 2, which states:
The ultimate objective of this Convention is to stabilize greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the climate systems. Such a level should be
achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally
to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to
enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.62
The Kyoto Protocol, a greenhouse gas emissions reduction treaty linked to the UNFCCC,
was adopted by the COP in 1997 and entered into force in 2005. The Kyoto Protocol is an
international agreement that commits developed countries and countries in transition to
market economics to reduce their overall GHG emissions. The Kyoto Protocol created the
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under which developing country projects that
reduced emissions and contributed to sustainable development earned credits that could be
sold to countries or companies with a commitment to reduce emissions. More that 1.5 billion
tonnes of carbon dioxide were avoided through the CDM, and US$ 9.5-13.5 billion in direct
benefits went to host counties from the sale of credits as of 2012.63 The first commitment
period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. Parties to the Kyoto Protocol adopted an
amendment in 2012, which has yet to enter into force. Kenya ratified the Kyoto Protocol on
25th February 2005.
The Paris Agreement entered into force internationally on 4th November 2016, thirty days
after 5th October 2016, the date on which the threshold for entry into force was achieved. As of
May 2018, 178 Parties had ratified the Convention, surpassing the threshold for entry of at
least 55 Parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55% of the total
global GHG emissions.
The Paris Agreement was ratified by Kenya on 26th December 2016 under section 9(1) of the
Treaty Making and Ratification Act, and entered into force for Kenya on 27th January 2017.
Kenya’s NDC sets out the country’s actions to contribute to achieving the global goal set out in
the Paris Agreement (see Box 5). As set out in Article 2(6), and read with Article 94(5) of the
Constitution of Kenya (2010), the Paris Agreement now forms part of the law of Kenya.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

Box 5: Kenya’s Nationally Determined Contribution
▪
Adaptation contribution - ensure enhanced resilience to climate change towards the attainment of
Vision 2030 by mainstreaming climate change into the Medium Term Plans (MTPs) and
implementing adaptation actions.
▪
Mitigation contribution - seek to abate GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 relative to the business as
usual scenario of 143 MtCO2eq.
Achievement of the NDC is subject to international support in the form of finance, investment,
technology development and transfer, and capacity development.

The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change
by keeping global temperature rise this century to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
Additionally, the Agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the
impacts of climate change. To reach these ambitious goals, appropriate financial flows, a new
technology framework, and an enhanced capacity building framework will be put in place to
support developing countries.
The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is an operating entity of the Financial Mechanism of the
UNFCCC that serves the Paris Agreement and supports projects, programmes and other
activities in developing countries. The Fund aims for a 50:50 balance between mitigation and
adaptation investments, and engages directly with the private sector through its Private Sector
Facility. As of May 2018, 43 governments had made pledges to the GCF totalling US$ 10.3
billion.64 The Global Environment Facility manages contributions from donors through
trust funds to help developing countries meet the objectives of international environment
conventions, including the UNFCCC. The trust funds include the Adaptation Fund, Special
Climate Change Fund, and Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT).
Kenya is signatory to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (1992)
(CBD) and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (1994)
(UNCCD). Kenya became Party to the CBD on 24th October 1994 and ratified the UNCCD on
25th June 1997. These two conventions plus the UNFCCC are known as the Rio Conventions
and are intrinsically linked because they address interdependent issues such as sustainable
land management and land degradation neutrality.
Kenya is a signatory to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer, a global agreement with universal ratification to protect the stratospheric ozone layer
by phasing out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. The Protocol
was agreed on 16th September 1987 and entered into force on 1st January 1989. Kenya ratified
the Montreal Protocol on 9th November 1988. Kenya’s ratification of the Kigali
Amendment to phase down the production and usage of hydrofluorocarbons was in
progress in June 2018. At the end of 2014 over 98% of controlled ozone-depleting substances
had been eliminated. A very significant co-benefit is emission reductions of 135,000

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is an international
environment treaty that was signed in 2001 and entered into force in May 2004. The
Convention aims to eliminate or restrict the production and use of persistent organic
pollutants. Kenya ratified the Stockholm Convention on 24th September 2004. Climate change

has potential impacts on the releases, transport, distribution, and toxicity of persistent organic
pollutants, which could lead to higher health risks for human populations and the
environment.
The Minamata Convention on Mercury aims to protect human health and the
environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury
compounds. The Convention was adopted and opened for signature in October 2013; 94
countries had ratified the agreement by June 2018. Kenya was in the process of preparing its
instrument of ratification in June 2018. Both the UNFCCC and Minamata Convention place a
significant onus on emissions from coal combustion and promote efficient use of coal.
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10th December 1982
(UNCLOS) aims to establish a comprehensive set of rules governing the oceans. Kenya ratified
UNCLOS on 2nd March 1989. The interface between climate change and this international law
include changes to the existing boundaries of maritime zones because of sea level rise, and
requirements to regulate emissions from aircraft and marine vessels. There is discussion
around the dispute settlement mechanism established in UNCLOS eventually attracting
claims relating to climate change.66
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly Resolutions A37-19
(2010) and A38-18 (2013) set global aspirational goals to ensure carbon neutral growth from
2020 and a 2% annual increase in fuel efficiency up to 2050. In 2015, Kenya set a target to
achieve an annual average fuel efficiency improvement of 2% equivalent to 2.86 MtCO2e until
2030 and an aspirational fuel efficiency improvement rate of 2% per annum from 2031 to
2050. Kenya ratified the Convention on International Civil Aviation on 1st May 1964.
Kenya has been a member of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) since 1973.
The IMO adopted an initial strategy in 2018 to reduce total annual GHG emissions from ships
by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008. The Protocol to the International Convention for
the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1997, known as MARPOL Annex VI, regulates air
emissions from ships. Compliance with these IMO regulations has mitigated GHG emissions
from international shipping. Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology hosts
the regional Maritime Technology Cooperation Centre for the Africa region that aims to help
mitigate the harmful effects of climate change. The Kenya Ports Authority has initiated a Green
Port Strategy.
The Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-lived Climate Pollutants,
founded in February 2012, is a voluntary partnership of 60 governments, intergovernmental
organisations, businesses, scientific institutions, and civil society organizations committed to
improving air quality and protecting the climate through actions to reduce short-lived climate
pollutants. These pollutants include emissions of black carbon (soot), methane, tropospheric
ozone and some hydrofluorocarbons. Kenya became a partner of the coalition in 2012.
The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is a voluntary
agreement that recognises that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk, but that
responsibility should be shared with other stakeholders including local governments, the
private sector and other stakeholders. It aims for the following outcome: “The substantial
reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic,
physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and
countries.”67 Kenya adopted the Sendai Framework in 2015.

Kenya is committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that was adopted
by world leaders, including the President of the Republic of Kenya, in September 2015 at the
United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Summit. On 1st January 2016, the 17
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) officially came into force (see Box 6).

Box 6:  Sustainable Development Goals

While the SDGs are not legally binding, governments are expected to take ownership and
establish national frameworks for the achievements of the goals. The 2030 Agenda includes
dedicated goals for climate change (SDG 13) and protecting, restoring and promoting
sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15); and also mainstreams consideration of
climate change impacts and climate actions across all the SDGs. The 2030 Agenda introduces
the overriding objective of “leaving no one behind” that has strong implications for the

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

29

definition and selection of climate actions. This objective prioritises the poorest and most
marginalised people so that they progress at a higher rate than those better off. To ensure that
no one will be left behind, world leaders committed to end extreme poverty and curb
inequalities by 2030, and underscored that no goal of the 2030 Agenda will be met until it is
met for everyone.68

2.2
The Regional Legal and Policy Framework
At the regional level, the African Union’s Agenda 2063 commits to climate change action
that prioritises adaptation and calls on member countries to implement the Programme on
Climate Action in Africa, including a climate resilient agricultural development programme.
Agenda 2063 commits to building climate resilient economies and communities, and notes
that participation in global efforts for climate change mitigation will support and broaden the
policy space for sustainable development.
The East African Community (EAC) Secretariat developed a Climate Change Policy and
Strategy (2010) to guide partner states and other stakeholders on the preparation and
implementation of collective measures to address climate change in the region. The Policy
prescribes statements and actions to guide adaptation and mitigation to reduce the
vulnerability of the region, enhance adaptive capacity, and build socioeconomic resilience of
vulnerable populations and ecosystems. The EAC is developing a climate change bill and forest
policy and strategy; and exploring the establishment of an alliance on carbon markets and
climate finance.
The Lake Victoria Basin Commission developed a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy
and Action Plan (2018-2023) that presents a roadmap for addressing and adapting to climate
change impacts.
The African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100) aims to bring 100
million hectares of land in Africa into restoration by 2030. The commitments announced
under AFR100 also support the Bonn Challenge adopted in 2011, whose overall objective is to
restore 150 million hectares by 2020; the New York Declaration on Forests that stretches the
goal to 350 million hectares by 2030; and the African Resilient Landscapes Initiative to
promote integrated landscape management to promote adaptation to and mitigation of
climate change. In 2016, Kenya committed to restore 5.1 million hectares of land.

2.3
The National Legal and Policy Framework
A robust framework of policies, plans and institutions is being progressively established at the
National and County levels to address climate change. The foundation of the institutional and
legal framework for climate change action is the Constitution of Kenya (2010). Article 10
sets out national values and principles of governance, such as sustainable development,
devolution of government, and public participation, that are mandatory when making or
implementing any law or public policy decisions, including climate change. Article 42 provides
for the right to a clean and healthy environment for every Kenyan, which includes the right to
have the environment protected for the benefit of present and future generations through
legislative and other measures.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

30

The Constitution of Kenya (2010) created the devolved system of government comprised of
the National Government and 47 County Governments. The concept of devolution goes
beyond mere decentralisation of government services, providing a form of self-governance at
the local level and a process of equitable sharing of resources. The County Governments have
a key delivery role in implementing the Climate Change Act, 2016, having jurisdiction, as set
out in the Fourth Schedule (Part 2) of the Constitution, over sectors relevant for climate
change such as agriculture, soil and water conservation, forestry, water and sanitation, and
health. Article 203(2) of the Constitution requires that County governments be allocated a
minimum of 15% of national revenue received annually, but the allocation often surpasses the
minimum thus giving County governments considerable scope to influence climate change
investments.
The Constitution of Kenya advances gender equality, stating in Chapter 4, the Bill of Rights
that “women have the right to equal opportunities in political, economic and cultural spheres,”
and in order to achieve that equality, requires that government to put in place and implement
affirmative actions that deliver equity for women. This commitment to gender equality and
implementation of gender equity is taken up in section 7(6) of the Climate Change Act, 2016
that requires the President to ensure compliance with the two thirds gender principle when
appointing members to the National Climate Change Council. Further, section 8(2)(c) of the
Climate Change Act, 2016 obligates the Cabinet Secretary responsible for climate change
affairs to formulate and implement a national gender and intergenerational responsive public
education and awareness strategy.
The Climate Change Act, 2016 is the key legislation guiding Kenya’s climate change
response, setting the legal basis for mainstreaming climate change considerations and actions
into sector functions, and providing the legal foundation of the NCCAP. This NCCAP 2018-
2022 responds to provisions in the Climate Change Act, 2016 that require the updating of the
NCCAP every five years (see Box 7).

Box 7: The Climate Change Act (No. 11 of 2016)
The Climate Change Act (2016) is national legislation that provides for
an enhanced response to climate change, and provides mechanisms
and measures to achieve low carbon climate resilient development.
The Government of Kenya, led by the Ministry of Environment and
Forestry, worked with stakeholders from civil society, the private
sector, and national and county governments to develop this climate
change legislation. The Act adopts a mainstreaming approach that
includes integration of climate change considerations into all sectors
and in County Integrated Development Plans. The Act establishes the
National Climate Change Council, chaired by His Excellency the
President. The Council is responsible for overall coordination and
advisory functions. The Act also establishes the Climate Change Fund –
a financing mechanism for priority climate change actions and
interventions.

The main policies, plans and frameworks that influence and guide climate change actions in
Kenya are briefly described in Table 3, and elaborated in Chapter 2 of the Adaptation Technical
Analysis Report (ATAR): NCCAP 2018-2022 Volume II

Action Plan (2013-2017)
Kenya’s National Climate Change Action Plan, 2013-2017 was a five-year plan
that aimed to further Kenya’s development goals in a low carbon climate
resilient manner. The plan set out adaptation, mitigation and enabling
actions.
National Adaptation Plan
(2015-2030)
Kenya’s National Adaptation Plan 2015-2030 was submitted to the UNFCCC
in 2017. The NAP provides a climate hazard and vulnerability assessment and
sets out priority adaptation actions in the 21 planning sectors in MTP II.
Kenya’s Nationally
Determined Contribution
(NDC) (2016)
Kenya’s NDC under the Paris Agreement of the UNFCCC includes mitigation
and adaptation contributions. In regard to adaptation, “Kenya will ensure
enhanced resilience to climate change towards the attainment of Vision 2030
by mainstreaming climate change into the Medium Term Plans (MTPs) and
implementing adaptation actions.” The mitigation contribution “seeks to
abate its GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 relative to the BAU scenario of 143
MtCO2eq.” Achievement of the NDC is subject to international support in the
form of finance, investment, technology development and transfer and
capacity development.
Climate Change Act (No.
11 of 2016)
The Climate Change Act (No. 11 of 2016) is the first comprehensive legal
framework for climate change governance for Kenya. The objective of the Act
is to “Enhance climate change resilience and low carbon development for
sustainable development of Kenya.” The Act establishes the National Climate
Change Council (Section 5), Climate Change Directorate (Section 9), and
Climate Change Fund (Section 25).
Kenya Climate Smart
Agriculture Strategy
(2017-2026)
The objectives of the Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Strategy (KCSAS) are
to adapt to climate change and build resilience of agricultural systems while
minimising greenhouse gas emissions. The actions will lead to enhanced food
and nutritional security and improved livelihoods.
Climate Risk Management
Framework (2017)

The Climate Risk Management Framework for Kenya integrates disaster risk
reduction, climate change adaptation, and sustainable development so that
they are pursued as mutually supportive rather than stand-alone goals. It

promotes  an integrated climate risk management approach as a central part
of policy and planning at National and County levels.
National Climate Change
Framework Policy (2018)
The National Climate Change Framework Policy aims to ensure the
integration of climate change considerations into planning, budgeting,
implementation and decision-making at the National and County levels and
across all sectors.
National Climate Finance
Policy (2018)
The National Climate Finance Policy promotes the establishment of legal,
institutional and reporting frameworks to access and manage climate
finance. The goal of the policy is to further Kenya’s national development
goals through enhanced mobilisation of climate finance that contributes to
low carbon climate resilient development goals.
Big Four Agenda (2018-
2022)
The Government of Kenya Big 4 Agenda establishes priorities areas for 2018
to 2022 of ensuring food security, affordable housing, increased
manufacturing and affordable healthcare. Sector plans and budgets are to be
aligned to the Big Four priorities.

At the national level, several ministries and departments have established climate change
units and climate change-related plans and policies to guide and mainstream climate actions
in their sector, listed in Table 4.

Chapter 3:  Priority Climate Change Actions for 2018-2022

3.1
Identification of Priority Climate Change Actions
National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP 2018-2022) takes cognisance of the impacts of
climate change on Kenya’s socio-economic sectors. It identifies strategic areas where climate
action over the next five years is linked to the Big Four agenda (see Box 8), recognising that
climate change is likely to limit the achievement of these pillars. Food security is threatened
through climate change-driven declines in agricultural productivity. The destruction of tens of
thousands of hectares of crops and loss of livestock in the floods of March-May 2018 are recent
examples of the impacts on farmers and pastoralists. Other negative climate impacts include
an increase in vector-borne diseases, including malaria and cholera; damage to infrastructure,
including homes, schools and hospitals; and high prices for electricity due to a reliance on
thermal generators when dam levels are too low to sustain hydropower production.
Adaptation actions are prioritised in NCCAP 2018-2022 because of the devastating impacts of
droughts and floods, and the negative effects of climate change on vulnerable groups,
including women, older members of society, persons with disabilities, children, youth, and
members of minority and marginalised communities. These actions will be undertaken, where
possible, in a way to limit GHG emissions to ensure that the country achieves its NDC under
the Paris Agreement to reduce GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 relative to the business-as-
usual scenario of 143 MtCO2e.

Box 8: The Big Four
Food and Nutrition Security - Never again should we allow the vagaries of weather to hold us hostage. Over
the next five years we shall invest heavily in securing our water towers and river ecosystems to harvest and
sustainability exploit the potential of water resources. We shall provide, together with other actors, key
enablers within the farming process that will address distribution, wastage, storage and value-addition of
agricultural commodities.

Affordable Housing - Over the next five years, we will create 500,000 new homes owners through the
facilitation of affordable housing, and a home ownership programme that will ensure every working family
can afford a decent home by injecting low-cost capital into the housing sector. Reforms will be undertaken
to lower the cost of construction and improve accessibility of affordable mortgages.

Enhancing Manufacturing - Over the next five years, we will grow the manufacturing sector and raise its
share of the nation’s cake from 9% to 15% by reducing power tariffs charged to manufacturers by 50%
between the hours of 10:00 pm and 6am. This is in line with our 24-hour economy policy.

Universal Health Coverage - Over the next five years, we will target 100% Universal Healthcare Coverage
for all households by ensuring that 13 million Kenyans and their dependents are beneficiaries of the
National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) scheme. This will be achieved through a complete reconfiguration
of the NHIF and reform of the laws governing private insurance companies.

The Official Website of the President sets out the Big 4 Action Plan. See: http://www.president.go.ke

The priority climate change actions in this Action Plan contribute to achieving sustainable
development benefits (see Box 9). These actions will benefit vulnerable groups through direct

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

36

and indirect benefits, such as increased agricultural productivity and improved water
accessibility. NCCAP 2018-2022 actions provide benefits for women through access to clean
cooking, and forest restoration and agroforestry actions that provide energy and water
sources.

Box 9: Climate change-SDG impact assessment
MEF examined the impacts of climate change mitigation and adaptation actions on the SDGs and Big Four
Agenda to foster alignment and synergies. Particular attention was given to the way climate actions address
the overriding objective of the 2030 Agenda to “leave no one behind.” This objective involved prioritising
the poorest and most vulnerable in the pursuit of sustainable development to end extreme poverty and
curb inequalities by 2030. The analysis systematically assessed the impact of all climate actions on SDG 1 on
poverty eradication, SDG 5 on gender equality, and SDG 10 on reducing inequalities.
The analysis indicated that the implementation of NCCAP 2018-2022 can provide an significant contribution
to the attainment of the Big Four, including the achievement of food and nutrition security for all Kenyans.
Climate actions are essential for reducing the vulnerability of the manufacturing, housing, health, and
agriculture sectors. NCCAP 2018-2022 generates opportunities to boost the productivity of the agriculture
and manufacturing sectors and supports improved health outcomes.
The MEF assessment found that adaptation and mitigation actions in NCCAP 2018-2022 directly address or
provide likely benefits for all the SDGs. The greatest potential benefits are related to:
▪
Sustainable agriculture and food security (SDG 2 and Big Four Food Security)
▪
Sustainable and renewable energy (SDG 7 and Big Four Manufacturing)
▪
Ecosystem restoration and preservation (SDG 15 and Big Four Food Security)
▪
Water availability (SDG 6 and Big Four Food Security)
▪
Sustainable growth and industry (SDG 8 and Big Four Manufacturing)
▪
Sustainable transport (SDG 9 and Big Four Manufacturing)
▪
Sustainable waste management (SDG 11 and Big Four Health)
▪
Human health (SDG 3and Big Four Health)
Low-carbon energy sources; ecosystem-based solutions such as climate smart agriculture, rangeland
restoration and agroforestry; and the development of sustainable public transport systems have sizeable
win-win benefits for boosting employment and manufacturing capacity, protecting the environment, and
narrowing inequalities.
Government of Kenya (2018). Report on the Impact Assessment of the Second National Climate Change
Action Plan on the Big Four Agenda of the Government of Kenya and the National Implementation of the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nairobi: MEF.

The priority climate change actions in this Action Plan reflect input received from National
and County Governments; vulnerable groups including women, youth, persons with
disabilities, and members of marginalised and minority communities; private sector; civil
society; and sector experts. These climate change actions are mainstreamed in the Third
Medium Term Plan in all sectors and in Country Integrated Development Plans to ensure that
strategic climate change actions are taken up across the country and in all relevant sectors.

3.2
Priority Climate Change Actions
NCCAP 2018-2022 outlines the programmes and strategies for adaptation and mitigation for
1st July 2018 to 30th June 2023. It is a comprehensive plan that:

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

37

▪
Enables all sectors to take action to achieve climate change adaptation and mitigation
objectives;
▪
Supports achievement of the Big Four agenda and sustainable development goals;
▪
Enhances the adaptive capacity and resilience of communities, with an emphasis on
vulnerable groups within society;
▪
Undertakes actions, where possible, in a way that limits GHG emissions to ensure
that the country achieves its mitigation NDC under the Paris Agreement; and
▪
Enables actions to be undertaken in an integrated manner that address several
priorities. For example, actions to plant trees also contribute to disaster risk
management, water and food security objectives.
The priority climate change actions are summarised in Table 6 and described in this chapter.
Further details on the priority actions and all other climate change actions identified by
stakeholders are included in the Adaptation Technical Analysis Report (MTAR): NVCCAP
Volume II and the Mitigation Technical Analysis Report (MTAR): NCCAP Volume III.

For each priority action, information is included on the problem being addressed, the action
needed to address the problem, expected results, national-level indicators, alignment with the
Big Four Agenda, alignment with SDGs, and relevant institutions to deliver the actions.
NCCAP 2018-2022 recognises that certain enabling activities cut across the strategic
priorities, such as improving the legal and policy framework, building capacity and enhancing
knowledge management, promoting technology and innovation, increasing access to climate
finance, and measuring and reporting on climate actions. These enabling actions are described
in Chapter 4.

Climate Change Priority 1: Disaster (Drought and Flood) Risk Management
Climate-related disasters, such as drought and floods, could prevent the achievement of the
Big Four agenda.

Impacts of climate disasters on Kenyan society and economy
The impacts of climate-related disasters are felt at the household level through food insecurity,
damage to property, and increased prices of food and fuel; and at the national level, where
scarce government resources are re-allocated to address the impacts of floods and drought at
the expense of social programmes such as health and education. Climatic shocks have
significant impacts on national GDP.
Prolonged and chronic droughts in Kenya are increasing due to poor or failed rains caused by
climate change. Drought conditions in late 2017 and early 2018 left 3.4 million people severely
food insecure and an estimated 500,000 people without access to water.69 The cyclical nature
of drought disasters and incomplete recovery from the climate-related impacts of drought
means that some households have become increasingly vulnerable, losing their ability to
spring back.70
Prolonged droughts lead to crop failure, shrinking of productive crop areas, and loss of
livestock leading to reduced food security and increased malnutrition with impacts
particularly for pregnant women, lactating mothers, children and the elderly. Droughts
increase water scarcity with negative impacts for communities, especially for women and girls
who have to travel long distances for water and have less water for hygiene. Droughts mean
that women work harder to feed and care for their families, and women take up roles that used
to be the preserve of men, who often migrate to take up paid work in urban areas.
Droughts have negative impacts on pastoralists in the ASALs, including livestock deaths due
to lack of forage and water, and increases in insecurity and conflicts within Kenya and across
national borders. Many pastoralists keep large livestock herds for cultural reasons, but also to
cushion against the adversities of drought,71 that can have negative impacts on rangeland
management. A significant number of people from marginalised and minority groups in the
ASALs rely on emergency assistance in times of drought.
Droughts negatively impact businesses through reduced water for manufacturing processes,
increased costs of inputs in the agro-processing sector, and increased prices for electricity as
hydropower declines and is replaced by diesel generators.
Floods have more immediate, and often large-scale impacts, such as the flooding in early 2018
that claimed over 183 lives and displaced more than 225,000 people,72 and the Solai dam
disaster in May 2018 that claimed 47 victims, over half of them women and children. Persons
with disabilities and the elderly are particularly at risk during floods and disasters because
they may be left behind or abandoned during evacuation. Eleven flood-prone areas have been
identified in Kenya (see Figure 6).

A proactive approach to tackle climate-related disasters
The priority climate actions promote a proactive, rather than reactive, approach to climate-
related disasters. The actions work to ensure that disasters are curtailed, do not result in
emergencies, and build the capacity of people to cope with the impacts of climate change. The
actions include flood and drought early warning systems including at the community level,
improved social protection programmes for chronically food insecure populations,
implementation of flood management plans (that include water storage, drainage networks,
reforestation and rehabilitation of riparian areas, construction of dams, and land use
restrictions73), County Climate Change Funds for locally-identified priority adaptation actions,
and community-level capacity building to raise awareness and educate on disaster
management and flood hazards. In particular, women, as central players in disaster response,
are provided with resources and support to carry out these roles effectively.
Some of the climate actions will be implemented under the National Disaster Risk
Management Policy, approved by Cabinet in 2018, and the National Drought Emergency Fund
(NDEF). This Fund was established in 2018 with an annual allocation of KES 2 billion from

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

40

the Exchequer to support action against climate-induced risks, including drought risk
management, resilience and preparedness measures, response interventions, and recovery
interventions that include protecting the most vulnerable populations.74 The Contingencies
Fund, established in the Constitution (2010), addresses urgent and unforeseen needs, and can
be used to provide disaster relief. Other programmes that deliver climate actions include the
National Drought Management Authority, Ending Drought Emergencies, National Safety Net
Programme, and County Climate Change Funds.
The climate change actions to proactively manage climate-related disasters result in:
▪
Adaptation – increased number of households benefiting from social protection
systems and County Climate Change Funds, with an emphasis on reaching the poor
and marginalised and minority groups; improved ability to cope with droughts and
floods through early warning systems, water harvesting and storage; and
implementation of integrated flood management plans.
▪
Big Four – progress toward the achievement of all four pillars by ensuring that
climate-related disasters do not divert resources.
▪
Sustainable Development –  reduced exposure and vulnerability of the country, and
especially of the poor and vulnerable groups, to climate disasters and shocks.

Strategic Objective 1:  Reduce risks to communities and infrastructure resulting from climate-
related disasters such as droughts and floods.
Issue/problem:  Floods and drought have national economic consequences and extensive socio-economic
effects at the household and community levels, especially for vulnerable groups, such as women, older
members of society, persons with disabilities, children, youth, and members of marginalised and minority
communities. Current responses are reactive rather than proactive, and impeded by inadequate early
warning systems, lack of disaster management coordination, and limited support to build disaster
preparedness.

Climate Change Priority 2: Food and Nutrition Security
Climate change has the potential to prevent the achievement of the Big Four goal on food and
nutrition security.

Increased food insecurity due to climate change
Climate shocks significantly impact the annual growth rate of the agriculture sector (see Figure
8); and this growth (or decline) has a large impact on the national economy. The agriculture
sector is highly susceptible to the vagaries of weather, including temperature increase,
precipitation changes, and extreme events.

Figure 7: Historical timeline of major agricultural production shocks in Kenya, 1980-2012

Source: World Bank, 2016.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

43

Climate change is expected to negatively impact crop yields in Kenya, with up to 45% yield
reductions expected for maize, rice, and soybean crops by 2100; and up to 40% yield losses for
tea and coffee because of the reduction of suitable areas for cultivation caused by temperature
increase. Livestock numbers are expected to decline as water resources become increasingly
scarce.
Dry weather conditions in 2017 led to a decline in the production of most agricultural
commodities, with real gross value added in the agriculture sector growing at a decelerated
rate of 1.6% from KES 879.6 billion in 2016 to KES 893.3 billion in 2017.75 The impacts of the
2017 drought included:
▪
Maize production declined by 6.3% in 2017 from 2016.
▪
Tea production decreased by 7% in 2017 from 2016, despite increases in the area
under production.76
▪
The number of cattle slaughtered rose by 5.3% from 2016 to 2017, which was
attributed to the drought as farmers and pastoralists slaughtered animals to cushion
their losses.77
▪
The quantity of fish from fish farming decreased from 15.0 thousand metric tonnes in
2016 to 12.4 thousand metric tonnes in 2017 because farmers did not re-stock fish
ponds due to high prices of inputs and the drying up of ponds due to drought.78
▪
The overall Import Dependency Ration of the Food Balance Sheet increased from
29.4% in 2016 to 42.7% in 2017 because of increased imports of vegetable products
caused by food deficits that resulted from drought.79
At the household level, drought caused high food prices; in 2017 the prices of maize, sugar,
rice, and milk hit record highs.80 The price of one kilogram of sugar increased from an average
of KES 118 in 2016 to KES 138 in 2017.81 These high prices particularly impacted the rural
areas of Kenya where households spent more than 60% of their income on food in 2017,
compared to 49% in core-urban areas.82
Pastoralists are impacted because extreme weather events lead to reduced pasture and forage
availability, degradation of the environment, and an increase in poverty. Strong winds and
dust storms erode top soil, making grass and rangeland regeneration difficult even when it
rains. Recurring droughts have forced an estimated 30% of livestock owners out of pastoralism
in the past 20 years.83
Fisher communities report that increasing temperatures impact fish breeding and fish
distribution. In the coastal areas, fish are moving from in-shore to deeper waters and artisanal
fisher communities lack the technologies to safely fish in deeper waters. Climate change is also
causing storms and rougher seas, preventing fisher communities from earning a living and
obtaining fish for sustenance in the months of May, June and July.84

Win-win solutions for climate, agriculture and food security
Most climate actions to increase food security take place in the agriculture sector, which
includes crops, livestock and fisheries. Agriculture is a priority of the people of Kenya because
of the sector’s importance to food security, rural livelihoods, and poverty alleviation. The
agriculture sector contributed 31.5% of GDP in 2017,85 provided about 75% of total
employment in Kenya and supported over 80% of the rural population.86

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

44

NCCAP 2018-2022 provides a range of actions to transform the agricultural sector. Increasing
production in a changing climate is necessary to achieve the Big Four food and nutrition
security goal over the next five years by enhancing large-scale production, driving smallholder
productivity, and reducing the cost of food. Thus, adaptation actions are the priority and food
security takes precedence over mitigation of GHG emissions. Many of the actions in the sector,
however, also reduce GHG emissions – such as agroforestry, sustainable land management,
and efficiency in livestock management. Reducing GHG emissions where possible is important
because agricultural emissions accounted for approximately 40% of total national emissions
in 2015.87
The main action will be the implementation of the Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) Strategy,
2017-2026 that aims to enhance the adaptive capacity and resilience of farmers, pastoralists
and fisher communities; and minimise GHG emissions from agricultural production systems.
Actions with measurable goals over the next five years are included in the table below, with
other actions set out in Volumes II and III of the NCCAP, the ATAR and MTAR.
To ensure success, these climate actions include focused interventions to address gender
because women account for 75% of the labour in the agriculture sector.88 Many impoverished
women are farmers who suffer the impacts of climate change more than men because of lack
of input to decision-making, insecure land tenure and limited access to land, and limited
access to livestock and technology. Farmer field schools are a participatory and effective way
to transfer knowledge to, and learn from, women farmers. Gender-aware agricultural
extension services are essential to ensure that women receive, use, and benefit from vital
information such as Climate Information Services. These services are also important for
pastoralists, and the information needs to be available in local languages and on the radio to
reach those who are illiterate and do not understand the languages used by most television
stations.
Some climate actions to increase food and nutrition security will be supported through on-
going programmes, including the Kenya CSA Strategy Implementation Framework and
Strategy, CSA Project, National Agricultural Rural Inclusive Growth Project, Kenya Cereal
Enhancement Programme – Climate Resilient Agricultural Livelihoods, insurance pilot
programmes, and partnerships with the World Agroforestry Centre and International
Livestock Research Institute.
The climate change actions to improve food and nutrition security result in:
▪
Adaptation – maintained or increased production and enhanced resilience of the
agricultural sector through livelihood and crop diversification, increased water
harvesting and storage, increased irrigation, sustainable land management,
reductions in post-harvest losses, and uptake of insurance.
▪
Mitigation – GHG emissions of 2.61 MtCO2e by 2022 through agroforestry, minimum
tillage systems, manure management, and efficiency in livestock management.
▪
Big Four – progress toward the achievement of food and nutrition security.
▪
Sustainable Development –  improved agricultural, livestock and fish productivity;
increased food and water security; improved incomes and livelihoods of pastoralists
and small-holder farmers; improved health with more healthy food available; and
better management of ecosystems and their biodiversity.

Strategic Objective 2: Increase food and nutrition security by enhancing productivity and
resilience of the agricultural sector in as low carbon manner as possible
Issue/Problem: Climate change is negatively impacting agricultural productivity and resilience of value
chain actors, including households. An increase in the severity and frequency of climate change-related
disasters such as droughts and floods poses threats to food security and negatively impacts small-scale
and large-scale farmers, pastoralists and fisher communities.

Climate Change Priority 3: Water and the Blue Economy
NCCAP 2018-2022 addresses one of Kenya’s largest challenges, water scarcity. The decline in
access to quality water is exacerbated by climate change (such as drought and reduction of
glaciers) and has the potential to undermine achievement of the Big Four agenda. Water is
linked to the Blue Economy, which refers to the “sustainable use and economic development
of both aquatic and marine spaces, including oceans, coasts, lakes, rivers and underground
water.”89

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

47

Increased water scarcity: a vital challenge for Kenya
Kenya is a water scarce country with per capita water availability of 647 cubic metres (m3),
which is well below the global benchmark of 1000 m3 per capita, indicating chronic water
scarcity. Water coverage in the country currently stands at 55%, meaning that approximately
45% of Kenyans lack access to clean and safe drinking water. Kenya’s per capita surface water
storage is estimated to be 103.1 m3; with only 3.1 m³ available for domestic, livestock,
industrial, and irrigation use with the balance being for hydroelectric power generation.90 The
water situation in Kenya is made worse by climate change and compounded by deforestation,
low storage capacity, a growing demand for water, and sharing of over half the rivers, lakes
and aquifers with neighbouring countries. The rivers are drying up, lake levels are receding,
dams and water pans are silting, and water quality is deteriorating.
Erratic rains due to climate change have affected water supply with impacts on food
production. In early 2018, many urban areas faced acute water shortages following a
prolonged dry spell, and many rivers dried up impacting rural and urban areas. Rural women
are particularly affected because of impacts on their households and small-scale
agribusinesses, and the need to walk longer distances to obtain water. Women and girls are
primary collectors of water for domestic use and can be exposed to potential conflict at times
of water scarcities.
Climate change also impacts the Blue Economy. Extreme weather events negatively impact
maritime and shipping activities, and sea level rise and storm surges flood coastal settlements
and damage coastal infrastructure, such as ports. In the longer term, ocean acidification could
have negative impacts on fisher communities through declines of fish populations and their
movement to deeper waters because of warming ocean waters. The economic cost of climate
change impacts on fisheries and aquaculture is estimated to be 3% of GDP per annum by 2030
and possibly 5% by 2050.91 Maritime transport is a contributor to climate change, accounting
for approximately 2.7% of annual global CO2 emissions in 2014, and potentially rising to 10%
of total global GHG emissions by 2050 if other sectors make significant reductions.92

A comprehensive plan for ensuring access to quality water for all
NCCAP 2018-2022 aims to increase annual per capita water availability from 647 m3 to 1000
m3. To achieve this target, the plan proposes concrete actions to enhance resilience of the water
sector by ensuring adequate access to and efficient use of water for agriculture, manufacturing,
domestic, wildlife and other uses. The climate change actions involve women who help to
reduce water wastage at the household level and to some extent also support water agencies
in reducing wastage. The actions also promote the Blue Economy by encouraging low-carbon
actions in the maritime sector, ensuring coastal infrastructure that can withstand expected sea
level rise and storm surges, and assisting coastal fisher communities to cope in a changing
climate.
Many of the actions will be implemented under existing initiatives such as African Initiative
for Combatting Desertification; Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Project; and
Water Sector Trust Fund.
The climate actions are expected to result in:
▪
Adaptation – increased water availability through water harvest and storage,
improved water efficiency, and improved water availability.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

48

▪
Big Four – progress toward the achievement of food and nutrition security.
▪
Sustainable Development –  reduction in water scarcity through improved water
harvesting and greater water use efficiency; improved human health and well-being;
protection of coastal and marine ecosystems.

Strategic Objective 3:  Enhance resilience of the blue economy and water sector by ensuring
adequate access to and efficient use of water for agriculture, manufacturing, domestic, wildlife,
and other uses.
Issue/problem:  Access to and quality of water is expected to decline because of climate change (such as
drought and reduction of glaciers). Coastal areas are impacted by sea level rise, storm surges, increasing
ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification.

Climate Change Priority 4: Forests, Wildlife and Tourism
Sustainable and productive management of land and land resources are enshrined in Chapter
5 of the Constitution of Kenya, which among other things, stipulates that the state will work
to achieve and maintain a tree cover of at least 10% of total land area.93 NCCAP 2018-2022
will contribute to restore, preserve, and sustainability manage forest and other ecosystems
that play an essential role in Kenya’s economy.

Highly valuable but fragile ecosystems
Kenya is composed of seven different agro-ecological zones (see Figure 8) consisting of 82%
arid and semi-arid land (ASAL) and 18% humid to semi-humid land.94 Several ecosystems
providing various services exist across Kenya.

Kenya’s forest area covered 7.4% of land area in 201895, comprised of natural forests,
plantation forests, open woodlands, and a small amount of mangrove forests on the coast.
Grasslands are common in the ASAL area, with scattered natural forests that are small in
area.96 Kenya’s forestry sector is central to its economy and its future. Forests are important
national assets in terms of economic, environmental, social, and cultural values. The forest
sector is estimated to contribute about KES 7 billion to the economy annually and employs
over 50,000 people directly and another 300,000 indirectly. Five forests in the main water
towers regulate 75% of the country’s renewable water supplies, and more than 80% of the
energy generated in Kenya comes from wood.97 Forests offer water catchments, biodiversity
and conservation functions, and are home to and provide a variety of goods that support the
subsistence livelihoods of many communities, including forest resource users.98
Deforestation and forest degradation is a significant problem in Kenya that releases large
amounts of greenhouse gases, driven mainly by clearance for agriculture that is linked to rural
poverty and rapid population growth, unsustainable utilisation of forest products (including
timber harvesting, charcoal production, and grazing in forests), and past governance and
institutional failures in the forest sector.99 The negative impacts that result from deforestation
(such as soil erosion and increased flooding) are exacerbated by climate change.
Climate change is likely to affect the growth and development of tree species, resulting in
reduced biodiversity and capacity to deliver important forest goods and services. Climate
change also impacts biodiversity and wildlife, with subsequent impacts on tourism. In regard
to wildlife, climate change is expected to shift species distribution, reduce population size, and
lead to extinction of some species.

Multiple benefits of sustainable management of forests
Actions to increase forest cover and prevent deforestation and forest degradation have
important benefits for improving the livelihoods of a majority of Kenyans while enhancing the
climate resilience of the country.
Forests provide ecosystem services that contribute to reducing the vulnerability of people and
wildlife. Mangroves protect coastal areas against storms and waves, which are projected to
become even more intense with climate change and climate-induced sea-level rise. Forest
products provide safety nets to local communities when climate variability causes crop
failures. Women and forest resource users play a key role in managing forests and are crucial
to integrating forest conservation activities in livelihood activities.
Forests also provide hydrological ecosystem services such as regulation of storm waters. Upper
watersheds can increase infiltration of rainwater, reduce surface run-off, and control soil loss,
thus decreasing the destructive impacts of floodwaters. By storing run-off, forests also act as
natural water recharge areas by replenishing stream-flows. Any actions to combat
deforestation and speed up restoration of degraded lands will contribute to economic growth,
poverty reduction, and greater food security as well as help communities adapt to climate
change.
Forests also provide significant carbon benefits by mitigating the harmful effects of GHG
emissions by acting as “sinks” through carbon sequestration. The forestry sector is the second
largest contributor to Kenya’s GHG emissions after agriculture, accounting for 32% of
emissions in 2015, largely due to deforestation.100 The sector offers the greatest potential of all
mitigation sectors to reduce emissions (illustrated in the green wedge in Figure 6 in Section
1.3.3). The calculation of the technical mitigation potential was based on the assumption that

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

52

Kenya’s forest cover increases from 6% in 2013 to 10% by 2030, which would involve
establishment and protection of forests on additional 2.4 million hectares of forest land.101 The
calculation therefore assumes that by 2030, Kenya’s forests will cover 6.6 million ha against
the current estimate of 4.2 million ha.
While reducing GHG emissions is critical, mitigation actions that have adaptation and
sustainable development benefits are prioritised in NCCAP 2018-2022. Work is needed to
measure the results and benefits of action in the forestry and land-use sector, requiring linking
SLEEK with the Measurement, Reporting and Verification Plus (MRV+) system (see Enabling
action M3 in Section 4). Actions in other sectors also contribute to an increase in forest cover
and sustainable ecosystem management, including sustainable charcoal production (climate
change priority 6) and the promotion of clean cooking (climate change priority 7).
The climate change actions in the forests, wildlife and tourism sector result in:
▪
Adaptation – sustainability managed forests, increased forest cover, improved
management of rangelands and grasslands, reduced coastal erosion (mangroves), and
maintenance of ecosystems for wildlife and linking of protected areas.
▪
Mitigation – GHG emission reductions of 10.4 MtCO2e by 2023, through forest
restoration, afforestation and reforestation, and reducing deforestation.
▪
Big Four – progress toward the achievement of food and nutrition security.
▪
Sustainable Development –  restored and protected forests and rangelands, and their
ecosystems and biodiversity; increased forest cover; improved food and water
security; improved livelihoods of forest resource users; healthy wildlife populations
and viable tourism operations; poverty and inequality reduction; and opportunities
for timber industries and housing construction.

Strategic Objective 4:  Increase forest/tree cover to 10% of total land area; rehabilitate
degraded lands, including rangelands; increase resilience of wildlife.
Issue/Problem: Unplanned development (such as agricultural expansion, settlement, and
infrastructure development) and reliance on biomass for cooking leads to deforestation and
forest degradation, with negative impacts on wildlife and increased GHG emissions.

Climate Change Priority 5: Health, Sanitation and Human Settlements
Sustainable human settlements and sanitation services are essential for human health, a Big
Four pillar. NCCAP 2018-2022 proposes an integrated approach to climate actions that
address sustainable human settlements and health and sanitation services.

Climate-related threats to human health
The risk of malaria and other vector-borne diseases is projected to increase due to changing
climate conditions (see Figure 9). Approximately 13 to 20 million Kenyans are at risk of
malaria, with the percentage at risk potentially increasing as climate change facilitates the
movement of malaria transmission up the highlands. Rising temperatures will likely lead to
greater incidence of malaria at higher altitudes of the Kenyan highlands, and the number of
Kenyans at risk could increase to 89% by 2050. In areas where malaria already occurs,
transmission intensity is expected to increase along with the length of the transmission season.
Communities living at altitudes above 1,100 meters are more vulnerable to malaria epidemics
due to lack of immunity, lack of preparedness, climate variability, and other factors. Pregnant
women and children under five are the most vulnerable groups affected by malaria.102

Figure 9: Population at risk of malaria in Kenya (in millions)

Climate change increases risks for human health by impacting human settlements. The cities
of Nairobi, Kisumu, and Mombasa concentrate populations, economic activities and built
environments, thus increasing the risk of flooding, heat waves, and other climate and other
weather hazards. The most affected populations are the urban poor who tend to live along
river banks, on hillsides and slopes prone to landslides, near polluted grounds, in unstable
structures vulnerable to collapse in heavy rains, and along waterfronts in coastal areas. This is
especially true in informal settlements and other low-income areas, where high population
density and lack of infrastructure aggravates these problems. Coastal areas are vulnerable with
communities prone to flooding from sea level rise and storm surges. Improving the resilience
of the built environment in human settlements is needed including flood control, green
building technologies, and waste management.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

56

Building the climate resilience of waste disposal systems and facilities is of great importance.
The volume of solid waste generated across Kenyan urban centres increased from 4,950
tonnes per day in 2011 to 5,990 tonnes per day in 2014; a rate faster than the country’s
urbanisation rate.103 Improperly managed solid waste can accumulate in areas otherwise
intended for water runoff and flood control, and such conditions make cities and towns
vulnerable to floods and contaminated water from moderate rainfall, let alone intense and
heavy rain expected with climate change. Solid waste dumping sites are open in Kenya and
often exposed to run-off during heavy rains, leading to contamination of water resources and
negative health impacts. The need for adequate waste treatment is accentuated by growing
industrialisation of the economy and inappropriately disposed of solid waste and wastewater
that pollutes air, water, and soil, causing significant health and environmental problems.
The Government of Kenya’s main guiding approach to waste management is the “zero waste
principle” as set out in the National Solid Waste Management Strategy. Recycling,
composting, waste minimisation, and industrial symbiosis are important elements of the
strategy that aims to protect human health and the environment.
The waste sector contributes to climate change, accounting for about 3% of total national GHG
emissions in 2015. 104 This is a very small contribution in comparison to other sectors such as
agriculture, forestry, and energy.
Studies into the effects of climate change on health in Kenya reported increases in acute
respiratory infections for ASAL areas, emergence and re-emergence of Rift Valley fever and
leishmaniasis, and malnutrition. More severe and frequent flooding displaces communities
and increases the risks of water-borne diseases, such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid that
already affect large numbers of Kenyans.105 Higher temperatures are projected to increase
heat-related deaths in the elderly.106  Short-lived climate pollutants, including black carbon
(soot) and methane, are released through inefficient use and burning of biomass and fossil
fuels. Household air pollution is a big health challenge, leading to about 21,560 deaths
annually in Kenya. Women and children are particularly impacted. Exposure to household air
pollution almost doubles the risk for childhood pneumonia, and women exposed to high levels
of indoor smoke are more than two times as likely to suffer from chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease than women who use cleaner fuels and technologies.107
The climate actions in the result in:
▪
Adaptation – reduced incidence of malaria, climate-proofed landfill sites, and flood
control in urban settlements.
▪
Mitigation – GHG emission reductions of 0.72 MtCO2e by 2022 through mitigation
actions to reduce and recycle solid waste, green buildings, and exploring options for
methane capture and power generation.
▪
Big Four – improved health services and affordable housing.
▪
Sustainable Development –  improved human health, reduced burden of disease for
households, and greater individual productivity; improved engagement of women as
community health workers; improved and sustainable waste management; more
sustainable human settlements; reduced health impacts from inappropriate waste
disposal and biomass cookstoves; and improved surveillance and monitoring of
climate change-related diseases, including monitoring of deaths resulting from
indoor air pollution.

Strategic Objective 5:  Mainstream climate change adaptation into the health sector; and
increase the resilience of human settlements, including improved solid waste management in
urban areas
Issue/problem:  Kenya’s improvements in malarial control, water-borne diseases, respiratory diseases,
infant mortality and malnutrition are vulnerable to set backs from climate change. Inappropriate waste
management can have negative health impacts and contribute to GHG emissions.

Climate Change Priority 6: Manufacturing
Climate change could prevent the Big Four goal of increasing manufacturing to 15% of GDP
by 2022. NCCAP 2018-2022 supports the manufacturing sector by reducing the impacts of
climate change on its activities, and creating new economic and market opportunities.

Climate change impact on manufacturing
Manufacturing is capital intensive, with many long-life fixed assets, long supply chains, and
significant water requirements, which are negatively impacted by floods, droughts, and
extreme weather events. Climate change will increase resource scarcity (such as water and raw
materials) that are inputs to the manufacturing process. Reduced crop production will have
impacts on the agro-manufacturing sector. An example is the 2017 drought that affected tea
production and resulted in diminished turnover in processed tea.
While being impacted by climate change, manufacturing produces GHG emissions with the
sector emitting about 7% of Kenya’s total emissions in 2015.108

Win-win solutions for climate-resilience, low-carbon impact, greater productivity and
competitiveness
Climate actions to promote a green manufacturing sector focus on resource efficiency and
sustainable production and managing waste as a resource to create new product lines from
waste recovery and re-use.  Moving toward green manufacturing will require innovation and
promoting the micro, small and medium enterprises started by youth entrepreneurs, including
in the areas of urban and rooftop agriculture, and sustainable briquettes for cooking.109

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

59

The climate actions focus on improving energy and resource efficiency, including energy
efficiency in the industrial sector and reducing emissions from industrial processes. A priority
is charcoal production that uses very inefficient technologies. Actions to improve efficiencies
of charcoal kilns and to formalise the sector help to reduce deforestation and forest
degradation and are closely linked to Climate Change Priority 4 – Forestry, wildlife and
tourism.  Actions to formalise the charcoal sector can draw on the innovation of youth and
create roles for women in the value chain process.
The actions delivered under the Green Economy Strategy and Implementation Plan (GESIP)
are critical to achieving green manufacturing and are complementary to the manufacturing
actions in this NCCAP (2018-2022).110 Some of the actions will be implemented under existing
programmes, such as the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) Centre for Energy
Efficiency and Conservation; and will complement programmes such as the Kenya National
Cleaner Production Centre’s SWITCH Africa Green-Industrial Symbiosis Project, and the
Green Growth and Employment Programme.
These climate actions result in:
▪
Adaptation – improved water use efficiency and industrial symbiosis.
▪
Mitigation – GHG emission reductions of 0.45 MtCO2e by 2022 through sustainable
charcoal production, industrial energy efficiency, and industrial symbiosis.
▪
Big Four – progress toward the achievement of the goals of the manufacturing pillar.
▪
Sustainable Development – promotion of sustainable production and green
industries; renewable energy; greater energy and water efficiency; improved
manufacturing productivity; reduced deforestation and forest degradation;
development of green industries and jobs; promotion of innovation for youth and
women.

Climate Change Priority 7: Energy and Transport
Clean, sustainable and affordable energy and transportation systems are essential for Kenya’s
sustainable development and are infrastructure enablers for the Big Four agenda.

Major impact of climate change on the energy and transport sectors
Climate change, including temperature increase, sea level rise, and a greater number and
severity of extreme weather events – such as heavy rains resulting in floods – damages energy
and transport infrastructure. These climatic changes increase the risk of delays, disruptions,
damage, and failure across land-based, air, and marine transportation systems. The impact of
drought on hydro-generated electricity is well understood in Kenya. Low water levels in the
country’s hydroelectric dams because of the drought in early 2017 led to the increased use of
diesel-powered generators and an increase in the price of electricity.111 The floods in early 2018
caused extensive damage to the road network.
Climate change impacts have consequences for the design, construction, location, and
operations of energy and transport infrastructure. Climate-proofing, or proactive adaptation,
can be cost-effective for energy and transport infrastructure with a long lifespan (most
transportation and energy infrastructure is expected to last for 50 years or longer). Climate-
proofing is a key recommendation of Kenya’s NAP as a means of addressing infrastructure-
related climate change impacts, and is necessary to maximise potential development benefits.
Climate proofing of infrastructure requires factoring in an additional cost associated with the
burden of climate change in the design, implementation, and maintenance of infrastructure.
Reducing GHG emissions in these sectors is required to achieve Kenya’s mitigation NDC.
Kenya’s energy sector contribution to GHG emissions is expected to increase sharply from
2015 to 2030. The energy sector (excluding transport and industry) accounted for 7.1% of total
emissions in 2015 and is projected to rise to 29.7% of total emissions in 2030. The transport
sector is a significant source of GHG emissions, directly accounting for about 13% of Kenya’s
total GHG emissions in 2015. Transport emissions are increasing at a faster rate than other
sectors and are projected to rise to 17% of total national emissions in 2030.112

Strong opportunities for transforming the energy and transport sectors
The implementation of NCCAP 2018-2022 can drive major transformations in the energy and
transport systems of Kenya, which will support the achievement of the Big Four Agenda and
provide strong benefits for poverty reduction and sustainable development.
The draft 2015 Energy and Petroleum Policy indicates that rapid growth in Kenya’s economy
over the past decade is partly attributed to increased investment in the energy sector,
particularly in the electricity sub-sector. In 2016/2017, installed electricity generation capacity
was 2,333 MW, with geothermal accounting for 44% of the generation mix, hydro 33%,
thermal 21% and imports 2%.113 An estimated 6.7 million households comprised the off-grid
and decentralized electricity market in 2013.114 Supply consisted of micro and pico systems,
mini-grids, and stand-alone systems – with solar, wind, and hydro being the main resources
in use.
Electricity generation based on renewable energy also has impacts for the transport sector,
particularly the electrification of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) that is expected to take
place by 2022.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

62

In regard to energy demand, the transition to clean cooking is a priority action that presents
an opportunity for technological leapfrogging with energy and GHG emissions savings, and
health and cost-saving benefits compared to the business-as-usual incremental
improvements. Clean cooking is an opportunity for investment in innovation and technology
development in the biomass energy sub-sector. A key action is to develop programmes that
encourage product availability and affordability through a robust pipeline of businesses to
manufacture products, sell products, and provide services at affordable prices.
The transition to clean cooking – through the uptake of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol
and other alternative fuels in urban areas, and improved biomass cookstoves in rural areas –
is about more than energy. It improves the health of women and children, and protects forests.
About 70% of Kenyans rely on biomass (fuel wood and charcoal) energy for cooking, which is
a main driver of deforestation and forest degradation.115 The use of biomass fuels for cooking
is a pressing health, social, and environmental problem. About 21,560 Kenyans die every year
from health conditions that can be traced back to indoor air pollution.116 Use of LPG to replace
charcoal can reduce 55 deaths per year per 25,000 households and save up to 30 trees per
household each year.117 Clean cooking can also save money at the household level. Charcoal
briquettes cost KES 3 to cook a meal of maize and beans for a family of five, compared to KES
26 for charcoal and KES 45 for kerosene.118
Women and children are disproportionally affected by this challenge, suffering from toxic
smoke, time poverty, and the consequences of deforestation. The use of clean cooking
technologies should be integrated into community development initiatives and activities
involving women.  They are the most affected and have the potential to drive the achievement
of the desired outcomes.
The climate actions result in:
▪
Adaptation – climate-proofed energy and transport infrastructure.
▪
Mitigation
- Electricity supply - GHG emission reductions of 9.2 MtCO2e by 2022 through
development of geothermal and other renewable energy for electricity supply,
energy efficiency, and use of clean coal technology.
- Energy demand - GHG emission reductions of an estimated 7.1 MtCO2e by 2022,
through uptake of alternative fuels and efficient cookstoves.
- Transport - GHG emission reductions of 1.82 MtCO2e by 2022 through
electrification of the SGR, extension of the SGR, construction of the Bus Rapid
Transit system in the Nairobi metropolitan area, low carbon technologies in the
aviation and maritime sectors, and pilot projects on electric vehicles.
▪
Big Four – progress toward the achievement of the Big Four pillars through the
provision of energy and transport services.
▪
Sustainable Development –  sustainable and renewable energy; new business
opportunities for clean energy and transport sectors; reduced deforestation, forest
degradation and stress on forests; protection of water catchment areas; and reduction
of deaths from indoor air pollution from 49% of the total annual deaths (21,560 in
2017) to 20%.

Actions with significant emissions reductions are included in the table below; the full list of
energy and transport actions are included in the MTAR.

Strategic Objective 7a:  Ensure an electricity supply mix based mainly on renewable energy that
is resilient to climate change and promotes energy efficiency; encourage the transition to clean
cooking that reduces the demand for biomass.
Issue/Problem: Renewable and affordable electricity supply with low GHG emissions needs to increase to
meet the demands of a growing population and industrialising nation. 70% of Kenyans depend on biomass
for primary energy most of which is non-renewable. This leads to indoor air pollution, deforestation, and
GHG emissions.

3.3
Climate Change Priority Actions in the Counties
The success implementation of the actions in the NCCAP will be based on efforts in the 47
Counties (see Figure 10). County Governments are the main implementing agents of many
climate actions set out in Section 3.2, and implement the actions in a locally-appropriate
manner that accounts for the unique needs of their populations. The County Governments
play a critical role in such areas as:
1. Disaster Risk Management – Response measures to address drought, floods, and
other climate-driven disasters.
2. Food and Nutrition Security – Agriculture, including crop and animal husbandry;
livestock sale yards; county abattoirs; plant and animal disease control; and fisheries.
3.  Water and the Blue Economy – Water management, and implementation of national
government policies on water conservation.
4. Forestry, Wildlife and Tourism – Implementation of the natural resource and
environmental conservation policies, and management of community and private
forests.
5. Health, Sanitation and Human Settlements – County health facilities and promotion
of primary health care; refuse removal, refuse dumps and solid waste disposal;
housing; and storm water management systems.
6. Manufacturing – Planning and development.
7. Energy and Transport – Electricity and gas reticulation, energy regulation, and
county transport.
The Climate Change Act, 2106 requires that County Governments mainstream climate change
actions and interventions in the CIDPs, taking into account National and County priorities. In
2013, all 47 CIDPs mentioned the impacts of climate change and many identified actions to
address these impacts. The main climate change impact was an increase in temperatures
resulting in prolonged dry spells and drought. Erratic rainfall, flooding, and unpredictable
weather patterns were also noted. The CIDPs noted that climate change negatively impacted
economic activities, leading to reduced food and livestock production, scarcity of potable
water, increased spread of diseases, and increased conflict (human/human and
human/wildlife).119
The impacts of and responses to climate change vary across the Counties as noted during
consultations with the six County Economic Blocs. The Counties in each of the Economic Blocs
consulted during the development of NCCAP 2018-2022 are listed below:
▪
Frontier Counties Development Council – Garissa, Isiolo, Mandera, Marsabit, Wajir
▪
Jumuiya Ya Kaunti Za Pwani – Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Mombasa, Taita Taveta, Tana

All six economic blocs identified two main climate change issues requiring action in the
NCCAP 2018-2022: droughts and floods. Other impacts of climate change identified by the
Counties are listed in Box 10 below.

Counties also identified issues that are not caused by the impacts of climate change but can be
addressed through mitigation actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include tree
planting and addressing deforestation and forest degradation to achieve 10% tree cover. A
coordinated approach to forest management includes priority actions identified by the
Counties: protecting forests, planting trees, addressing charcoal production and
unsustainable logging, and promoting clean cooking (including efficient jikos and biogas and
LPG alternatives). Counties also identified the need to promote renewable energy including
wind and solar.
Improved waste management systems were noted as a priority for many Counties. Climate
change actions to reduce emissions in the area of waste management included waste to energy,
capture of methane from landfill sites, and promotion of a circular approach to waste
management that promotes recycling. Adaptation actions related to waste management
include proper siting of landfill sites to account for expected climate change (such as rainfall
and flooding).
The actions identified by the Counties focus on the needs at the local level, reflecting the
realities and priorities of communities. Most of the actions have sustainable development
benefits that will improve the lives of vulnerable groups in society, including women, youth,
and marginalised and minority communities. The actions address the needs of pastoralists,
whose livelihoods are being severely impacted by climate change; smallholder farmers that
form the basis of the agricultural sector; and the fisher communities that are the backbone of
coastal communities.

Chapter 4:  Delivering the Action Plan

4.1
Enablers
A range of crosscutting enabling actions are required to implement the adaptation and
mitigation actions set out in the seven priority climate change areas described in Chapter 3.
These enabling actions equip government and stakeholders with the finance, knowledge, skills
and technologies needed to deliver and report on adaptation and mitigation actions.
The crosscutting enabling actions described in this section include:
▪
Enabling policy and regulatory framework;
▪
Capacity development and knowledge management;
▪
Technology and innovation;
▪
Climate finance and resource mobilisation; and
▪
Measuring climate results.
This section provides brief descriptions of the priority enabling actions to be completed from
1st July 2018 to 30th June 2023. The descriptions note if the actions are continued from NCCAP
2013-2017, identify the relevant institutions, and set out process indicators to measure
progress and achievements.

4.1.1 Enabling Policy and Regulatory Framework
The process of developing a comprehensive policy and regulatory framework for climate
change is well underway in Kenya, as demonstrated by the Climate Change Act, 2016, and
National Climate Change Policy, 2018. A key element of the Climate Change Act is the
requirement for various regulations to provide further interpretation of certain provisions,
and to support operationalisation of the administrative aspects of the Act such as reporting
requirements. At the County level, support is needed to develop appropriate legislation,
including climate fund regulations, that are informed by the local context, aligned to county
systems, and conform to national public finance policies and laws. This legal and policy
framework will guide development and utilisation of County Climate Change Funds and
enable climate finance to address County-specific local issues. The two enabling actions are
described below in Table 8.

4.1.2 Capacity Development and Knowledge Management
Knowledge management refers to the organisation and sharing of climate change knowledge.
Capacity development is defined by the UNFCCC as enhancing the capacity and ability of
countries to take effective climate change action.120 The priority capacity development actions
(see Table 9) emphasise establishing the engendered coordination structures for the CCD to
effectively implement the Climate Change Act, 2016 and National Climate Change Policy and
deliver on Kenya’s NDC. The actions will also build the capacity of climate change units in
state departments, and assist NEMA to incorporate climate change in environmental
assessments and develop its enforcement role.
Building the capacity of County Governments will be a priority. This action will include
building the capacity of County Executive Committee (CEC) members responsible for climate
change and officials assigned to the climate change units in County. This will include support
to report on climate change, to enhance the implementation of public finance management in
relation to climate finance, and to develop policies and frameworks linked to the Climate
Change Act, Climate Change Policy, and Climate Finance Policy.
The operation of the National Climate Change Resource Centre (NCCRC) is a priority action
to promote climate information and knowledge management. This Centre provides a one-stop
repository of climate change-related information and is equipped with an online climate
change portal. This centre, located in Nairobi at KMD headquarters, is a national facility
complete with a library, amphitheatre and training facilities; and is open for public use.
The integration of climate change in education curriculum, the development of a gender and
inter-generational awareness plan, and the development of a public awareness and
engagement strategy are priority actions required under the Climate Change Act, 2016.

4.1.3 Technology and Innovation
The technology and innovation actions are important enablers of success for the adaptation
and mitigation actions described in Chapter 3. An overall objective is to support the sectors to
promote appropriate technologies to deliver adaptation and mitigation actions, such as water
harvesting, climate information services, and clean cooking technologies. Technology
development and transfer is defined by the IPCC as a broad set of processes covering the flows
of know-how, experience, and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change
amongst stakeholders such as governments, private sector entities, financial institutions, civil
society, and academia.121
Technology and innovation enabling actions (see Table 10) include building the capacity of
KIRDI to deliver on its role as the National Designated Entity (NDE) for the Climate
Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) under the UNFCCC. Other research institutions will
be supported to promote climate innovation role, including the Kenya Agriculture and
Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI), and
Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI).
The enabling actions promote the role of the private sector in developing and disseminating
adaptation and mitigation technologies to deliver the priority climate actions. The
development and deployment of locally-relevant climate change technologies will be
supported through the provision of incubation and capacity building services and financing to
Kenyan entrepreneurs. The promotion of sustainable production and consumption will help
the private sector achieve resource efficiency and move toward industrial symbiosis. The
identification of appropriate and effective policy and fiscal tools will be another action.
Technology diffusion and uptake can be facilitated through policy and fiscal incentives, such
as the 100% duty remission for inputs and raw materials for assembly of clean energy cooking
stoves imported by local manufacturers introduced in the 2018/19 budget statement.122
Another priority is to assist KMD to improve provision of Climate Information Services (CIS),
which includes immediate and short-term weather forecasts and advisories. Climate
information is important for farmers to manage risk, for planning standards and regulations,
and for assessing climate change risks in environmental assessments. Climate information is
a critical element of early warning systems that help communities, especially vulnerable
groups, cope with extreme weather events like droughts and floods.

4.1.4 Climate Finance and Resource Mobilisation
The priority climate finance and resource mobilisation actions set out in Table 11 implement
the National Climate Finance Policy, 2018. The actions emphasise designing and launching
the Climate Change Fund, developing a climate finance and resource mobilisation strategy,
piloting the issuance of Green Bonds, improving access modalities and efficiency of climate
finance, and ensuring that climate finance is available for actions in key sectors, including the
Big Four.
The actions help the Government of Kenya effectively mobilise, manage, and track climate
finance actions. A priority is the operationalisation of the Climate Change Fund that will be
overseen by the National Climate Change Council and will allocate funding for priority
mitigation and adaptation actions. The action includes the establishment of the regulations,
and management and oversight functions. Work will also be undertaken to link the national
fund with County Climate Change Funds. In early 2018, such funds were established in
Garissa, Makueni and Wajir Counties, and were in the planning and design stages in many
other Counties.
Building the capacity of The National Treasury and Planning as the National Designated
Authority (NDA) to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a priority action. Capacity is needed to
track and report on sources, applications, and impacts of climate finance. Climate finance
includes all finance that targets low-carbon or climate-resilient development; and includes
domestic budget allocations, public grants and loans from bilateral and multilateral agencies,
and private sector investment. Important sources of international climate finance for Kenya
include the GCF and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which are the entities entrusted
with the operation of the Financial Mechanism of the UNFCCC. Other mechanisms under the
UNFCCC include the Special Climate Change Fund, Adaptation Fund, and REDD+
mechanism.
Tracking of and reporting on climate finance will include an alignment of climate finance
(tracked by National Treasury and Planning) and adaptation and mitigation results (tracked
by CCD). This will improve analysis, including identifying actions that provide value for
money, determining how much climate finance reaches those most in need (such as women,
youth and marginalised and minority communities), and the climate impact of that finance.
The National Treasury and Planning will develop a climate finance resource mobilisation
strategy that will be cascaded to the Counties, recognising that action will take place at the
County level, with climate finance reporting taking place at the national level.
The capacity of the private sector to access climate finance will be built, recognising the critical
role of private sector investment in implementing the priority climate actions in Chapter 3.
This includes developing bankable projects and accessing funding through Green Bonds. The
National Treasury and Planning will work with financial institutions to increase their
understanding of climate finance, develop a climate risk index, and develop climate-related
funding schemes in high-risk areas.
Kenya needs to be well positioned to act on emerging carbon market opportunities and to
benefit from results-based payment mechanisms. This action will support engaging in the
development of new market mechanisms under the UNFCCC, developing clarity on the
treatment of emission reductions in Kenya created through climate finance and investment,
improving Kenyan capacity to engage in carbon asset activities, strengthening the viability of
domestic carbon asset production, and increasing access to international carbon markets.

4.1.5 Transparency: Measurement, Reporting and Verification Plus (MRV+)
The Paris Agreement under the UNFCCC sets out an enhanced transparency framework for
action and support. Kenya will be expected to provide information on mitigation, adaptation and
support received, including:
▪
National GHG inventory to enable tracking of progress on implementing and achieving
the mitigation component of the NDC.
▪
Information related to climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation.
▪
Information on financial, technology development and transfer, and capacity building
needs and support received from developed countries.
Kenya’s transparency framework is based on the measurement, reporting and verification plus
(MRV+) system defined in NCCAP 2013-2017 as “an integrated framework for measuring,
monitoring, evaluating, verifying and reporting results of mitigation actions, adaptation
actions and the synergies between them.”123
The MRV+ system includes MRV of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases for
mitigation actions (see Table 12). Kenya reports to the UNFCCC through National
Communications and Biennial Update Reports, which include GHG inventories in the
agriculture; energy (including transport); land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF);
industrial processes; and waste sectors.
Adaptation actions are tracked through a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system.
Currently, there are no agreed adaptation indicators at the international level. Kenya made
progress under NCCAP 2013-2017 and the NAP to identify relevant and appropriate indicators
to track progress on adaptation and building resilience.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

81

The MRV+ system generates information for national and international reporting
requirements. Reporting to the National Climate Change Council needs to demonstrate that
climate change action and spending on climate change leads to real results. For mitigation this
means demonstrating that GHG emissions are lower than the projected baseline and Kenya is
delivering on its NDC. For adaptation this means demonstrating that people are better able to
cope with climate change. As an example, in the agriculture sector this means that production
is maintained or increased as the climate changes; for infrastructure this means that capital
investments are not damaged by extreme weather events (flooding, sea level rise and storm
surges) and maintain their value over time.
Kenya’s MRV+ system will be developed in a phased approach over 2018-2022. Initial action
will improve the measurement of adaptation outcomes including the identification of
indicators to measure climate-related impacts and the collection of baseline data. The
mitigation actions include the establishment of an appropriate process to collect, collate and
analyse GHG emissions; and improvements to and embedding of the SLEEK process. Actions
to 2020 will take place under established projects, including the US$ 2.2 million project to
help Kenya meet the transparency requirements of the Paris Agreement supported by the
Capacity Building for Transparency (CBIT) initiative of the GEF, and support for the third
GHG inventory from the UN Environment Programme and the Low Emission Climate
Resilient Development (LECRD) project managed by UNDP and funded by the United States
Agency for International Development.

Delivery and Coordination Mechanisms

4.2.1 Institutional Roles and Responsibilities
The Climate Change Act, 2016 sets out institutional structures and responsibilities that guide
the oversight and management of NCCAP 2018-2022. The responsibilities of the main
institutions engaged in the oversight, implementation, and monitoring of the NCCAP 2018-
2022 are described below and illustrated in Figure 11.

Figure 11:  Climate change institutional structures in the Climate Change Act

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

83

The National Climate Change Council, chaired by His Excellency the President of
the Republic of Kenya and co-chaired by the Deputy President, is responsible for
overall coordination and advisory functions, including guiding the implementation of NCCAP
2018-2022. The Council shall, among others, “ensure the mainstreaming of climate change
functions by the national and county governments”, and “approve and oversee the
implementation of the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP).” Members of the
Climate Change Council are set out in Section 7 of the Climate Change Act, 2016 and are listed
below:
▪
Cabinet Secretary responsible for environment and climate change affairs;
▪
Cabinet Secretary responsible for the National Treasury and Planning;
▪
Cabinet Secretary responsible for economic planning;
▪
Cabinet Secretary responsible for energy;
▪
Chairperson of the Council of Governors;
▪
Representative of the private sector;
▪
Representative of civil society;
▪
Representative of the marginalised community; and
▪
Representative of academia.
To ensure gender equity on the Council, groups recommending nominations for the
representatives for the private sector, civil society, marginalised communities and academia
are requested to take into account gender equity in context of the broader membership of the
Council.
The Cabinet Secretary responsible for climate change affairs is the Secretary to
the Council. The Cabinet Secretary formulates and periodically reviews climate change
policy, strategy, and the NCCAP, and submits to the Council for approval. The Cabinet
Secretary provides through the CCD technical assistance on climate change actions and
responses to County governments, based on mutual agreement and needs identified by County
governments. The Cabinet Secretary reports biennially to Parliament on the status of
implementation of international and national climate change obligations.
The Climate Change Directorate established in the ministry responsible climate
change affairs is responsible for coordination of the implementation of NCCAP 2018-2022,
including coordination of climate change actions and related measurement, monitoring, and
reporting. The CCD is the Secretariat for the Council and coordinates the technical
implementation of climate change functions. This includes providing analytical support and
technical assistance on climate change, and coordinating the implementation of and reporting
on the NCCAP 2018-2022. The responsibilities of the CCD are described in greater detail
below in Section 4.2.2.
In regard to implementation of climate change actions and implementation of \ NCCAP 2018-
2022, the Climate Change Act (No. 11 of 2016) sets out roles and responsibilities for
government entities:
▪
County Governments are responsible for integrating and mainstreaming climate
change into CIDPs, designating a County Executive Committee (CEC) member to
coordinate climate change affairs, and reporting on the implementation of climate

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

84

change on an annual basis. County governments are expected to establish Climate
Change Units, led by the CEC member responsible for climate change, that will
oversee the implementation of climate change actions stipulated in the 2018-2022
CIDPs [Section 19].
▪
State departments and national public entities are to establish Climate Change
Units responsible for integrating the NCCAP into strategies and implementation
plans; and report to the Council on an annual basis on performance and
implementation. All state departments and public entities will be required to report
on the priority actions in NCCAP 2018-2022, even if they did not implement climate
change actions [Section 15(5)].
▪
National Treasury and Planning is responsible to develop a strategy and make
regulations setting out procedures and powers to identify sources of climate finance
and to monitor use, and to work with the Cabinet Secretary responsible for climate
change affairs to develop incentives for the promotion of climate change initiatives
[Section 25(9) and Section 26]. The Climate Change Fund is vested in National
Treasury [Section 25(2)].
▪
The National Environment Management Authority is responsible, on behalf of
the Council, for monitoring and enforcing compliance of climate change
interventions [Section 17]; and for integrating climate risk and vulnerability
assessment into all forms of assessment [Section 20].
▪
The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development is to integrate climate
change into the national education curricula at all levels; and advise tertiary
institutions on the integration of climate change into their curricula [Section 21].
Mainstreaming and reinforcing climate change disaster risk reduction into strategies and
actions of public and private entities [Section 3 (2)(d)] will require participation of the
following government entities:
•
The National Drought Management Authority coordinates drought
management and disaster risk reduction actions in the 23 ASAL counties. NDMA
plays a critical role in mainstreaming and reinforcing climate change disaster risk
reduction into strategies and actions of public and private entities [Section 3 (2)(d)],
including reporting annually to the Council on the status and progress of climate
change actions in the ASAL Counties.
•
The National Disaster Operations Centre is the focal point for disaster
management and response in Kenya, including drought, floods and landslides. The
Centre plays a critical role in mainstreaming and reinforcing climate change disaster
risk reduction into strategies and actions of public and private entities [Section 3
(2)(d)].
•
The National Disaster Risk Management Authority proposed in the National
Disaster Risk Management Bill, 2018, is expected to lead the coordination of disaster
risk management activities.
Various stakeholders have roles in implementing the second NCCAP (2018-2022) and
addressing climate change, including:

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

85

▪
Public: The public play a role in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of
climate change interventions, with an emphasis on enhancing adaptive capacity and
improving ability to withstand climate shocks.
▪
Private sector: Action on climate change and implementation of the NCCAP and
Act can be supported by the private sector in two ways: 1) Adaptation – making sure
businesses can adjust as well as possible to any consequences of climate change by
managing risk and exploiting opportunities; and 2) Mitigation – reducing greenhouse
gas emissions from business operations to minimise the impacts of climate change in
the future. The Council may impose climate change obligations on private entities
(Section 16 of the Climate Change Act), likely to be reporting requirements that
would be introduced in a phased manner and developed in consultation with the
private sector.
▪
Public Benefit Organisations: This includes non-governmental organisations,
civil society organisations and faith-based organisations, amongst others. They have
been involved in climate change activities in Kenya, and the UNFCCC acknowledges
the role of civil society in Paragraph 1(i) Article 4 in the areas of education, training
and public awareness related to climate change. In Kenya, civil society is known to be
a powerful agent of change through public awareness creation, policy research and
analysis, and advocacy on key socio-economic issues including climate change.
▪ Vulnerable groups within society, including women, older members of society,
persons with disabilities, children, youth, and members of minority or marginalised
communities are engaged through an inclusive approach to climate change action.
Due to inequities and disparities, these groups face disproportionate climate impacts.
Climate change actions will be delivered in a way that accounts for the unique needs
of these groups.
-
Women: Gender equality is a critical component of NCCAP 2081-2022 and
women will be engaged through planning, implementation, and monitoring
of climate change interventions. Women will be involved in reviews of
implementation of actions, and the development and implementation of the
gender and intergenerational plan.
-
Youth: Engagement of youth, who comprise the majority of the population
in many Counties, will be encouraged through schools, post-secondary
institutions, and youth-focused organisations. Youth are agents of change
and have influence on the broader community through their parents,
relatives, and families. They will be engaged through climate change actions,
and the development and implementation of the gender and
intergenerational plan.
-
Pastoralists, hunter gatherers and fisher communities: These
groups are a critical constituency. Article 56 of the Constitution of Kenya,
read together with Article 260, recognises these groups as marginalised
communities for whom efforts must be put in place to ensure they
participate and are represented in governance and other spheres of life. The
livelihoods of these communities are at risk because of climate change, and
adaptation actions engage these communities in implementation and
monitoring.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

86

▪
Academia and research institutions: Researchers help to provide the evidence
and science for knowledge-based decision making by National and County
Governments, private sector, development partners and civil society. They conduct
research on different aspects of climate change, including improving the
understanding of climate change attribution in Kenya and developing appropriate
technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change.
▪
Media: The media provides vital information at times of emergency — from warning
of imminent floods to explaining how to deal with disease outbreaks. The media
helps to disseminate information about climate change. Accurate, timely, and
relevant information is a critical component of resilience and appropriate climate
change action.

4.2.2 Coordination of the NCCAP
Role of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry through the Climate Change
Directorate
The CCD is responsible for the overall coordination of the implementation of this NCCAP
2018-2022, including coordination and reporting on implementation of actions by partners.
Section 9(8) of the Climate Change Act (No. 11 of 2016), provides guidance on the role of the
CCD, described below:
▪
Provide analytical support on climate change – for the various ministries,
agencies, and County Governments.
▪
Provide technical assistance – based on needs identified by County
Governments.
▪
Establish and maintain a national registry – for both mitigation and
adaptation actions.
▪
Serve as the national knowledge and information management centre –
for collating, verify, refining, and disseminating knowledge and information on
climate change.
▪
Coordinate adherence to the country’s international obligations –
including reporting on NDCs; developing national communications, biennial update
reports and Kenya’s GHG inventory; and representing Kenya in international
negotiations.
▪
Coordinate implementation of the gender and intergenerational plan – at
the National and County Government levels.
▪
Coordinate actions related to climate finance.
Additionally, the CCD is to work in collaboration with other agencies at the National and
County Government levels to:
▪
Identify low carbon development strategies and coordinate related MRV;
▪
Develop strategies and coordinate actions for building resilience to climate
change and enhancing adaptive capacity; and
▪
Optimise Kenya’s opportunities to mobilise climate finance.

National Climate Change Action Plan: 2018-2022

87

The CCD is delivering on these roles, including the establishment of a pilot registry, launching
the National Climate Change Resource Centre, and providing analytical support; but much
work remains and will be supported by the enabling actions set out in Section 4.1.
The CCD will establish an inter-governmental platform to improve its climate change
coordination function. This engendered platform will include key players in the climate
change response, including sector ministries, County Governments, private sector, civil
society, academia, and representatives of vulnerable groups (which could include women,
youth, and minority and marginalised communities). The members of this platform will assist
the CCD to access required information, mainstream climate change in plans and policies,
guide the actions of the Climate Change Units in state departments and County Governments,
monitor progress on implementing the Climate Change Act, 2016, and report to the National
Climate Change Council This platform will play a role in the M&E of NCCAP 2018-2022,
described below in Section 4.2.3.
Three coordination committees – adaptation, mitigation and means of support – will report
to the inter-governmental platform for climate change coordination. These technical
committees will provide advisory support for effective coordination of the respective issues,
support monitoring of actions, advise on gaps in implementation of the NCCAP, identify
climate finance opportunities, and propose solutions to enhance the delivery of NCCAP 2018-
2022. The committees will submit regular progress reports to the inter-governmental platform
and the CCD.

Role of the County Governments
The County Governments will support the CCD in its coordination role by:
▪
Nominating a County Executive Committee (CEC) Member to be in charge of
coordinating implementation of climate change actions. The CoG will work closely
with the CCD to ensure that County Climate Change Units are established,
strengthened, and functional, leading to effective implementation of NCCAP 2018-
2022.
▪
Mainstreaming climate change actions in their respective CIDPs, and implementing
and reporting on these actions over the next five years.
▪
Generating best practices, including development of County legislation that supports
climate change action. These best practices, together with those documented by the
National government, will be shared in Kenya and through global platforms.
▪
Reporting annually, at the end of every financial year, to the County Assembly on
progress achieved on the implementation of climate change actions. A copy of the
report will be sent to the CCD, which is responsible for compiling reports and
submitting a summary report to the Cabinet Secretary and the National Climate
Change Council.

4.2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of the NCCAP
The CCD is responsible for M&E of NCCAP 2018-2022. The implementation of the NCCAP
will be reviewed every two years as required by Section 13(7) of the Climate Change Act, 2016.
The review will utilise reports from County Governments and state departments, as well as
inputs from relevant stakeholders. Important stakeholders in the review process include

88

private sector, academia, women, youth, and minority and marginalised groups including
pastoralists, hunter gatherers, and fisher communities.
M&E of NCCAP 208-2022 will focus on demonstrating that investment in adaptation and
mitigation actions leads to real climate results and development benefits that are linked to the
Big 4 agenda. The M&E system will track implementation and results of NCCAP 2018-2022,
and climate finance raised to deliver on the action plan. This will provide the evidence base
for planning and implementing future actions, seeking support, and domestic and
international reporting.
The M&E system to report on implementation of NCCAP 2018-2022 will be linked to the
MRV+ system and SDG reporting. The establishment of the M&E system will include the
development of reporting frameworks for County Government and state departments, and
processes to compile, analyse, and report on actions and results. The key to success is a
workable M&E structure that is appropriate for a devolved governance system and for the
available resources. The M&E system will:
▪
Ensure that all state departments report on their progress and achievement of
NCCAP actions.
▪
Ensure efficient reporting processes for the County Governments, and draw
on established reporting procedures where possible, such as the National Integrated
Monitoring and Evaluation system and County Integrated Evaluation System.
▪
Report on climate finance that supports the delivery of NCCAP 2018-2022.
▪
Identify a limited number of national indicators that have baseline data
and are tracked by The National Treasury and Planning to measure climate-related
impacts at the national level. This will help to align the tracking and measurement of
climate change co-benefits with the Government’s Big 4 agenda and SDGs.
▪
Use gender-aggregated data where possible and prioritise collection of this data
if it is not available.
▪
Track and measure GHG emissions on a sector basis at the national level.
Measuring GHG emissions on an action or County basis is costly and resource-
intensive, and unlikely to generate robust information that is aligned with the national
GHG inventory approach.

4.2.4 Financial Requirements
CCD will require approximately KES 350 million annually to carry out its duties and functions
to ensure effective coordination and delivery of NCCAP 2018-2022. This funding will enable
CCD officials to participate in international discussions and negotiations on climate change;
build capacity of National Government ministries and departments, County Governments,
and other stakeholders; develop regulations and guidelines; mobilise and track climate
finance to deliver NCCAP 2018-2022; and monitor and report on climate actions.
