3.1 Raising Seedlings
(GHCP&PHHT20: Q9)
•
Tomato can be established through nursery or directly seeded
•
Normally, it is raised in nursery before transplanting
•
The seed rate is about 40 – 75 g/acre
•
Seed trays can also be used to raise seedlings
Nursery Site Selection:
•
The nursery should be sited in a plot that has not been planted
with a member of Solanaceae family for the last 3 years
•
Choose the site with good drainage
Nursery Establishment:
•
Prepare a seedbed of 1 m width and of a convenient length
•
Make drills on the seedbed at a spacing of 10 – 20 cm apart
•
Thinly sow the seeds in the drills and cover lightly with soil
16

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
3.1 Raising Seedlings Cont’
Management of Nursery:
• Water the nursery regularly
• Harden the seedlings 1 – 2 weeks before transplanting by
reducing the frequency of watering and gradually exposing
the seedlings to direct sunlight
• Insects such as whiteflies can transmit viruses to young
tomato plants hence should be controlled using pesticides
e.g. Amitraz (Mitac 20EC®), Buprofezin (Applaud 40%SC®),
Azadirachtin (Nimbecidine®), Imidacloprid (Confidor 70
WG®)
• The insects can also be blocked from reaching the
seedlings by use of an insect proof net (agricultural type)

3.2 Transplanting
3.2.1 Appropriate Time
• Seedlings are transplanted 30 – 45 days after seed sowing
• It is recommended that transplanting should be done either
early in the morning or late in the evening
3.2.2 Recommended Spacing (GHCP&PHHT20: Q10)
• Spacing: range from 75 – 100 cm (between rows) by 40 –
60 cm (between seedlings) depending on the variety
• Plant Population per Acre: range from 6,666 to 13,333
• Appropriate spacing produces short, stocky plants with
good root system and reduces disease incidences
19

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
3.2 Transplanting Cont’
3.2.3 Fertilizer Application Rates (GHCP&PHHT20: Q11)
• Make holes and add 2 – 3 handfuls of manure per planting
hole (8 tons/acre)
• The type and quantity of fertilizers will depend on soil
analysis results.
[General recommendations]
• Apply 2 bottle tops (10 g) of Triple Super Phosphate (TSP)
per planting hole (80 kg/acre)
• Apply Muriate of Potash (MOP) to enhance availability of
potassium
20

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
3.3 Water Requirement
(GHCP&PHHT20: Q12)
•
Tomato is sensitive to water deficit:
– Immediately after transplanting
– During flowering and fruit
development
•
Plants should be provided with adequate
water
•
Tomato plants are sensitive to water
logging and flooded fields should be
drained within 1 – 3 days
Irrigation Methods:
•
Furrow and drip irrigation are the most
effective methods
•
Furrow irrigation minimizes spread of
fungal diseases, such as “Early Blight”
•
Drip irrigation on the other hand is
efficient on water utilization
•
Overhead irrigation encourages
spread of diseases such as “Early Blight”

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
3.4 Top-dressing
(GHCP&PHHT20: Q14)
•
Tomato crop should be fertilized with organic and inorganic
fertilizers to produce high yields
•
Top-dressing fertilizer such as CAN should be applied in 2
splits at 40 kg & 80 kg/acre at 4 and 8 weeks after
transplanting which is a general recommendation
•
Soil analysis results provides specific information for each
farm
•
Application method: circular band around the stem
•
Inadequate top-dressing can result in physiological
disorders such as:
– Hollow cavities and poor taste in fruits due to
potassium deficiency
– Blossom-end rot due to an imbalance between nitrogen,
calcium and soil moisture
22

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
•
Indeterminate varieties
need staking/training to
facilitate pruning,
harvesting and other
cultural practices
•
Determinate varieties don't
require staking but may be
staked in wet season to
prevent fruit contact with
the soil. On the other hand,
mulch may be used
instead of staking
•
Staking materials: wooden
stakes, bamboo or any
sturdy material
•
Strings, plastic strips or
other material can be used
to train the plant to the
stake

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
•
This practice is necessary for
the indeterminate varieties
•
It involves removal of side
shoots, extra flowers, fruits
and diseased leaves
•
Leads to early maturity of
fruits and encourages fruits to
increase in size and
uniformity
•
Sterilize pruning blades by use
of chlorine bleach and water at
a ratio of 1:1. Use of
unsterilized blades and
smoking can lead to spread of
diseases e.g. TMV, Bacterial
Wilt

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
3.5.3.A: African Bollworm
Identification:
•
Adult moth is dull yellow to brown
•
The female moth lays tiny round & brownish eggs near or on
flowers or small fruits
•
Larvae have alternating light and dark colored stripes on either
side of the body
•
The pupa is shiny brown
Damage:
•
Caterpillars feed on flowers and green fruits causing flower
abortion and sunken necrotic spots, respectively
•
Feeding holes made by the caterpillar serve as entry point for
bacteria and fungi which may lead to rotting of fruits
27

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
3.5.3.A: African Bollworm
Control:
•
Tilling & ploughing of old tomato field exposes pupa to
desiccation and natural enemies
•
Planting of trap crops (e.g. Cucumber, Maize and African
Marigold) which attract the pest before it attacks tomatoes (Need
to synchronize planting of both maize and tomatoes so that they
flower at same time)
•
Use of selective pesticides or microbial control agents like:
– Helicoverpa armigera SNPV virus (HelitecSC®)
– Indoxacarb (Avaunt 150EC®)
– Etofenprox 30%(TREBON 30 EC®)

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
3.10.3.B: Red Spider Mites
Identification:
•
Adult red spider mites are oval in shape and appear reddish
and have eight (8) legs
•
Eggs are very tiny, spherical and whitish; and are laid singly
on underside of leaves
•
Red spider mites spin silk threads/ web which protect/
anchor the pest and their eggs to the plant
Damage:
•
Leaves when infected show white to yellow speckling, later
turn pale or bronzed
•
High population causes serious drying and dropping of
leaves (defoliation) which leads to smaller and lighter fruits
30

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
3.10.3.B: Red Spider Mites
Control (Scouting & GAP):
•
Use of pesticides (miticides) such as:
– Spiromesifen (Oberon SC 240®)
– Hexythiazox (Arsur 100 EC®)
– Abamectin (Avirmec 1.8EC®, Almectin 1.8%EC®,
Agrimec 18EC®)
– Amitraz (Mitac 20EC®)
– Amblyseius californicus (Amblytech®-predatory mite)
•
Spider mites rapidly develop resistance to pesticides,
especially when they are used continuously for several
seasons
•
To avoid development of resistance, farmers need to:
– Use miticides with different chemical
composition/modes of action
– Avoid routine spraying
– Use the recommended dosage

It also burrows on stems causing breakages
•
A serious pest and can cause 100% loss if not controlled in time
43

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
3.10.3.F: Tuta absoluta
Control:
•
Early control is important before the pest pressure builds up
•
Carry out cultural practices like field hygiene, crop rotation
•
Carry out regular scouting/monitoring of pest population
•
Use of pheromone traps to attract male insects for both
monitoring/surveillance and pest control e.g. mating disruption, mass
trapping ‘lure & kill’ method, such as Tutrak, Tutalure (1m above the
ground, 4-6 traps/ acre)
•
Use of insecticides like
- Chlorantraniliprole  (Coragen®)
- Indoxacarb (Avaunt 150EC®, Merit 150SC®)
- Spirotetramat + Flubendiamide (Tihan OD®)
- Thiocyclam 50% w/w; Thiocyclam-hydrogenoxalate (Evisect S®)
- Imidacloprid (Grizly 175/30 SC®)
- Flubendiamide (Belt 480SC®)

3.10.4.d: Bacterial Wilt
General Descriptions:
•
This is a bacterial disease which is soil-borne
•
It is easily spread by run off  water and infected soil
Symptoms:
•
Rapid wilting and death of entire plant without yellowing or
spotting of leaves
•
When the stem of a wilted plant is cut across, the pith has a
darkened water – soaked appearance
•
When stem of wilted plant is squeezed, a greyish slimy ooze is
produced
•
To distinguish this wilt from others, when a thin slice is taken
from the brown stem tissue and placed inside a glass of water, a
milky ooze is produced from  the cut surface

3.10.4.e: Tomato Mosaic Virus
General Descriptions:
• This is a viral disease which is easily transmitted by
infected seed and plant debris in the soil
• Mechanically transmitted through transplanting seedlings
and pruning tools
Symptoms:
• Mottling of leaves with raised dark green areas
• The shape of young leaves is distorted
• Internal browning of fruits, especially when fruits are
affected at mature green stage
Control:
• Use certified disease- free seeds
• Remove crop debris and roots from the field
• Do not smoke or touch cigarettes as the virus is
transmitted  from tobacco leaves even if it is processed

3.10.4.f: Blossom-end Rot
3-26
General Descriptions:
•
This is a physiological condition
caused by calcium-nitrogen
imbalance in the soil, especially
when moisture level in the soil is low
Symptoms:
•
A rot at the blossom-end of the fruit
•
The surface becomes dark brown
and sunken
Control:
•
Maintain adequate soil moisture,
especially at fruit development
stages
•
Soil liming in calcium deficient soils,
reduce N and mulch the field
•
Top-dress with CN, Mavuno
Planting and ensure adequate soil
moisture
•
Spray the crop with calcium

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
3.10.4.g: Fusarium Wilt
General Descriptions:
•
The fungus is both seed- and soil-borne.
•
It causes most damage on light, sandy soils.
•
It is most active at temperatures between 25 and 32
oC.
•
The fungus can survive in the soil indefinitely even when no
tomatoes are grown.
•
It can also survive in fibrous roots of weeds (e.g. Amaranthus,
Digitaria and Malva species).
•
Acidic soils (pH 5.0 to 5.6) and excessive nitrogen fertilisation
promote disease development.
Symptoms:
•
The lower leaves of the plant usually turn yellow and die.
•
Leaflets on one side may be affected while those on the other
side are asymptomatic.
•
Diseased leaves readily break away from the stem. When
affected stems just above ground level and petioles are cut
diagonally, a reddish-brown discolouration of the water
conducting tissues will be observed.

3.10.4.g: Fusarium Wilt
Control:
•
Use resistant tomato varieties (e.g. "Fortune Maker", "Rio
Grande", "Tengeru 97", "Roma VFN“, Eden F1, Rambo F1, Anna
F1).
•
Use certified disease-free seeds.
•
Do not locate seedbeds on land where Fusarium wilt is known to
have occurred.
•
Where soil is acidic, raise the pH by applying lime or farmyard
manure.
•
Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilisation and control root-knot
nematodes.

4. Harvest
4.1 Harvesting Indices (GHCP&PHHT20: Q17)
•
Maturity period range between 3 – 4 months after transplanting
depending on:
– The variety
– Environmental conditions
•
Tomato can be harvested at different stages depending on the
market requirement and distance to the market
•
There are four (4) main harvesting stages:
– Mature-Green Stage: where the fruit is green but internal gel
is well developed
– Breaker/Turning Stage: up to 30% of fruit surface has definite
color break from green to yellow
– Pink/Light Red Stage: 30 – 90% fruit surface has pink/red
color
– Red/Ripe Stage: over 90% fruit surface has changed to red
color
62

MOALF/ SHEP PLUS
4. Harvest
•
Fruits should be harvested early in the morning when it is cool
since the fruit temperature is low
•
Harvested fruits should be kept in a cool, shaded and ventilated
area in order to minimize heat gain
•
When necessary, wipe fruits to remove dirt
•
The yields vary from 12,000 – 40,000kg per acre depending on
the variety and crop husbandry

5.2 Value Addition Techniques: Cleaning, Sorting, Grading, &
Processing (GHCP&PHHT20: Q19)
Sorting:
•
Sorting is done to remove damaged or diseased fruits.
Grading:
•
Tomatoes are graded depending on the uniformity of ripening and fruit
size
•
There are three (3) main tomato grades:
– Grade 1: big size fruits of uniform color and shape
– Grade 2: medium size fruits of uniform color and shape
– Grade 3: small size fruits with slight variation in color and shape
