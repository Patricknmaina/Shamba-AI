Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) considerations
The climate-smart agriculture (CSA) concept reflects an
ambition to further integrate agricultural development and
climate responsiveness. CSA aims to achieve food security
and broader development goals under a changing climate
and increasing food demand. CSA initiatives sustainably
increase productivity, enhance resilience, and minimise
greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Increased planning is
vital in order to address tradeoffs and synergies between
the three pillars: productivity, adaptation, and mitigation
[1]. By addressing challenges in environmental, social,
and economic dimensions across productive landscapes,
CSA practices and technologies coordinate the priorities
of multiple countries and stakeholders in order to achieve
more efficient, effective, and equitable food systems. For
the Tanzanian context, CSA is agriculture that sustainably
increases productivity and income, ability to adopt and build
community resilience to climate change and enhances food
and nutrition security while achieving mitigation co-benefit
in line with national economic development priorities. While
the concept is new and still evolving, many of the practices
and technologies that make up CSA already exist worldwide
and are currently used by farmers to cope with various
production risks [2]. Mainstreaming CSA requires a critical
mapping of successfully completed, on-going practices
and future institutional and financial enablers. This country
profile provides a snapshot of a developing baseline created
to initiate discussion at national and global levels about
entry points for investing in CSA at scale
•	 Tanzania’s agriculture sector is an important catalyst for
economic growth, poverty alleviation, and food security.
Nevertheless, the economic losses from climate change
impacts on agriculture are estimated at US$200 million
every year. The scaling up of climate-smart agriculture
(CSA) practices presents an opportunity to reduce such
losses, build resilience in the agriculture sector, improve
productivity and farmer incomes, and contribute to
climate change mitigation.
•	 Estimates
indicate
that
the
livestock
sub-sector
contributes the most to agricultural greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions. An increased focus on the development
and scale-out of livestock based CSA programmes are
required in order to support the country along a low
emissions development pathway.
•	 Viable CSA practices identified for the country include
improved fodder production, grazing management, water
harvesting, agroforestry, conservation agriculture, cover
cropping, integrated aquaculture, and integration of
biogas energy into farms.
•	 Scant evidence of the impacts of various CSA practices in
different agro-ecological zones and production systems
challenges their promotion and on-farm adoption.
Strengthening national and local knowledge, information,
and evidence on different CSA practices will be an
important step towards better targeting and prioritisation
of CSA investments and hence improved adoption.
•	 The government-led CSA Programme and the CSA
Guideline provide favourable mechanisms to promote
CSA as well as to direct public, private and international
funding towards CSA in the country.
•	 The
Tanzania
Climate-Smart
Agriculture
Alliance
(TCSAA) represents a promising opportunity for improved
coordination, dialogue, and information sharing on CSA
and there is need to ensure financial, administrative, and
technical support for the platform.
•	 Most of the CSA practices identified in the country are
site-specific and hence understanding of the different
socio-economic and environmental contexts across the
country is crucial when designing scale-out strategies.
•	 Public-private partnerships and the organisation of
farmers into cooperatives present good opportunities
to enhance smallholders’ access to credit for CSA
investments, particularly from micro-finance institutions.
•	 Wider adoption of CSA technologies and practices can
also be facilitated through strengthening of the extension
services on climate related matters, conducting of farmer
field trials for various CSA practices and enhancing
access to CSA related input and output markets.
•	 Capacity building on agricultural greenhouse gas
inventories and use of improved GHG modeling tools
could be an important step in helping the country to
better monitor, report and verify GHG emissions in the
agriculture sector.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Country Profile
People, agriculture and livelihoods in
Tanzania [3, 5, 6]
The agriculture sector contributed approximately 32%
to the country’s National Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
in 2015 [3], mostly through food crop production, which
accounted for approximately 65% of the agricultural GDP1
[4]. Agriculture accounts for a third of exports [5]. The sector
employs approximately 13 million people, the equivalent
of 59% of the economically active population [3]. Women
make up roughly half of the workforce and produce more
than 70% of the country’s food [4]. Approximately 7.2 million
youth make a living from agriculture. Fresh water and marine
fisheries also play important roles in Tanzania’s economy
and contribute to employment, food security, and incomes.
Low productivity has been linked to a combination of several
factors, including: over-reliance on rainfall, utilisation of
rudimentary and unsustainable production methods, poor
access to inputs, and low extension service capacity to deal
with climate change issues [2]. Closing the agricultural yield
gap would offer opportunities for agricultural sector growth
and livelihoods improvements throughout the county.
Tanzania’s population was estimated at 53 million people
in 2015, 68% of them residing in rural areas [3]. Despite
the country’s remarkable economic growth in recent

years, approximately 28% of the population lives below the
poverty line [7] and about half with less than US$ 1.90/day.
Unemployment rates amount to 86%. Tanzania has one
of the lowest Human Development Indices in the world,
currently at 0.521 [8]. Only 15% and 55% of the population
have access to electricity and potable water, respectively [3].
Own productive resources is skewed towards men; barely
20% of the women own agricultural land [3].
National context
Economic relevance of agriculture

Tanzania
Tanzania has a total land surface area of 885,800 square
kilometres [Km2] [9], of which 44 million hectares (ha),
(approximately 46%) has potential for crop production.
However, a large portion of this land is only marginally
suitable for agriculture, due to reduced soil infertility,
erosion, degradation and proneness to drought. As a
result, only approximately 32% of the land was cultivated
in 2014, a significant increase from 2011, when this area
was equivalent to about 23% of the arable land2[4]. The
high population growth rate (about 2.7%) has contributed
to significant land degradation and forest cover loss. The
country has a deforestation rate of about 372,000 hectares
per annum [10].

Roughly 9.1 million hectares (approximately 10.5% of total
land) are classified as rangeland [11, 12, 13]. Availability of
pastures and water for livestock largely depend on seasonal
rainfall thus making the livestock sub-sector vulnerable
to drought. In the semi-arid areas, where over 90% of the
traditional livestock are found, rainfall ranges between 400-
600mm per annum.
Fisheries represent the main livelihood source on the
country’s coastline (including Zanzibar and Pemba Islands),
which stretches along approximately 1,424 km of the Indian
Ocean.
The country is divided into 64 agro ecological zones (AEZs)
based on rainfall patterns, altitude, soil water holding
capacity, growing seasons and physiographic features [14]
(See Annex 1). Key farming systems include plantations
for tea, coffee and sisal and maize/legume systems in
Shinyanga, Rukwa, Morogoro, Arusha, Kigoma, Kagera
Iringa and Mbeya [15]. Agricultural production is dominated
by small-scale, subsistence farmers [3], with average farm
sizes ranging between 0.2 and 2 ha. Only 1.5% of the arable
land is under irrigation [16, 17]3. Agricultural input utilisation
is relatively low, compared to regional averages.
The main food crops cultivated in Tanzania are maize, rice,
cassava, banana, and potatoes, whereas major cash crops
include coffee, tea pyrethrum, tobacco, cashew, and sisal.
Maize is grown throughout the country, despite unsuitable
soils and climate in some areas.
The country has one of the largest livestock populations in
Eastern Africa, though contribution of the livestock sector
to agricultural  GDP is relatively low, estimated at 7.4%
in 2015 [13]. Indigenous breeds of cattle, sheep, goats,
poultry, and pigs are the most common livestock types
in Tanzania. Livestock production is mostly extensive,
practiced by pastoralists and agro-pastoralists on natural
pastures. Intensive and semi-intensive systems are common
for improved crossed or pure livestock breeds. Pastoralism
predominates in arid and semi-arid areas like Central
Dodoma, Singida, Shinyanga, Simiyu, the north-eastern
parts of the county such as Manyara, parts of Arusha and
Northern Iringa.
Based on economic contribution, productivity and nutrition
quality indicators, key production systems were selected for
further evaluation and inclusion in the country CSA. More
information on production system selection criteria is found
in Annex 2.

This figure on total arable land differs slightly from FAO estimates [5].

The five-year average (up to 2013) reported by FAO-Aquastat estimates an area under irrigation of approximately 2.3% [17].

Climate-Smart Agriculture Country Profile
Agriculture input use in Tanzania [3, 5, 17]
Production systems key for food security in Tanzania[5]
Tanzania ranks 94th out of 113 countries in the Global
Food Security Index [18], indicating overall slow progress
towards achieving food security targets [19, 20]. One-third
of the population is undernourished, while underweight and
wasting rates among children under the age of five remain
high [3].
Food insecurity is prevalent in low-income households
(particularly among people living below the poverty line),
where there is high reliance on agriculture for subsistence.
From a seasonal perspective, the people most exposed to
food shortages are the ones located in the north, east, and
northwest, where climate shocks (droughts) and changes
(reduced rainfall) are more severe [19]. High food prices,
pests and diseases that affect crop production, and low use
of farm inputs, are other factors affecting population´s food
security.
Previous research has revealed that, while the quantity of
food consumed by the population decreased (measured
through calorie intake in the households), the diversity
of the diets (referring to micronutrient intake) increased
[19]. Middle- and high-income groups of the population
are transitioning towards energy-dense diets, while people
belonging to the low-income group, particularly those
located in rural areas, remain highly food energy deficient.
However, updated information on the status of food security
and nutrition in Tanzania is scarce and existing reports rely
on data collected more than five years ago. This reiterates
the need for strengthening national information systems in
order to improve decision-making on targeted economic,
development, and agricultural investments.
Food security and nutrition

Tanzania
Accurate data on economy- and sector-wide greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions is relatively scarce for Tanzania.
Notwithstanding, data for 2012 indicates an average of
171.73 tons of CO2
equivalent (CO2 eq) [21] (including
emissions from Land Use Change and Forestry sector
[LUCF]) and per capita GHG emissions of approximately
2.7 tons of CO2 eq [10], depending on the source and
accounting methods. Agricultural emissions are mostly
related to methane (CH4) emanating from enteric
fermentation in livestock production.
Projections show a potential twofold increase in total
emissions by 2030 [22], under a scenario of continuous
population growth, increased deforestation, expansion
of agricultural land and farming activities, free-range
livestock keeping, continued use of biomass energy, and
the current industrial development pathway the country is
pursuing. As such, implementation of low-carbon options,
such as energy-efficient stoves for reduction of wood fuel
utilisation, manure management, and utilisation of biogas
could support existing efforts to diminish emissions levels
in the country. In addition, improved measurement of GHG
emissions in the agriculture sector, particularly focusing on
the emissions reduction potential of various CSA practices
and technologies, can incentivise the adoption and scale-
out of CSA practices and technologies that were originally
targeted for adaptation and productivity objectives.

In Tanzania, the agriculture sector receives less than 10% of the national budget, which is below the minimum allocation set in the 2014 Malabo Declaration of 2014 [9].
Challenges for the agricultural sector
The agricultural sector has experienced a stagnant growth
rate of 4.4% over the past years, compared to an expected
rate of 6% as outlined in the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture
Development Programme (CAADP) Framework [23]. This
has been associated with continued soil degradation due
to rapid population growth and poor implementation of
existing policies, inappropriate use of technologies (such
as increased use of fertilisers on mono-cropping systems),
soil erosion due to poor livestock rearing practices, and
continued use of traditional cropping methods (hand hoes),
among others. For livestock in particular, some of the main
challenges include inadequate zoning for grazing land, poor
infrastructure for livestock products marketing, as well as
high incidence of livestock diseases and pests [24].
A low extension to farmer ratio and limited technical capacity
of local governmental authorities to deliver agricultural
information (particularly CSA-related) has slowed down
the uptake of practices and technologies by small-scale
farmers. Agricultural practices and their potential to increase
productivity and climate resilience have been insufficiently
documented, hence CSA has hardly been on the agenda
of agricultural extensionists. Additionally, low budgetary
allocation to the agriculture sector4 has contributed to an
understaffing of extension services and a reduced capacity
to invest in climate adaptation and mitigation actions.
Poor road networks in the country hinder access to domestic
input and output markets. Despite the country’s membership
to the East African Community (EAC), the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and
the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
agricultural produce commercialisation on regional and
international high-value markets remains a challenge,
especially for horticulture and dairy farmers who lack the
incentives to adopt productivity-enhancing technologies.
High crop post-harvest losses, which amount to 20-40%
annually [25], and minimal value addition further hinder
access to markets. The majority of farmers sell raw, low
value produce to middle men who make most of the
profit. Limited farmer organisation and low business and
entrepreneurship skills, mean farmers lack collective buying
and bargaining power related to commercialisation and
credit access.
Dependence of agriculture on rainfall increases exposure to
climate risks, particularly to frequent droughts and periodic
flooding [26]. Drought is in fact the most problematic
climatic hazard in the country, especially in regions like
Dodoma, Singida, the northern parts of Iringa, north-eastern
parts of Tabora, eastern areas of Shinyanga, Simiyu, south-
eastern parts of Mara, parts of Manyara, north-western parts
of Arusha, and south-western parts of Kilimanjaro. In the
event of extreme drought, it is estimated that pastures and
water resources can only support 13% of all ruminants

Agriculture and climate change
The adverse effects of climate change in Tanzania have
already been documented in several government reports [4,
9, 12, 23, 26, 29]. The observed impacts include increased
rainfall variability, reduced water volumes in water bodies
such as rivers and lakes [29], increased pest and disease
incidence due to increased temperatures, salt water intrusion
(common in the coastal areas and Zanzibar), geographical
shifts of AEZs and ecosystems, and replacement of perennial
crops with annual crops owing to reduced crop cycles [26].
Small scale farmers are more likely to suffer the adverse
effects, given their reduced adaptive capacity [4].
Climate projections indicate an increase in temperatures by
1.4°C by the 2030s and 2.1°C by 2070. The West and North-
West will most likely experience faster warming (+1.9°C)
relative to the coastal regions (+1.7°C). While historical
rainfall trends have shown a decrease in precipitation [4]
and climate models for future rainfall regime changes are
rather uncertain, it is generally agreed that precipitation
levels will increase throughout the country, with uneven
regional distribution. The largest increases are most likely
to occur in the North-West (+7%), Centre and the North-
East. Nevertheless, rainfall variability is expected to increase
and reliability to reduce, as extreme events (droughts) are
expected to be more frequent and severe.
[13], leading to deterioration of livestock conditions and
increases in livestock mortality. Roughly 400,000 cattle died
during the 2009 drought [27].
Only 2.3% of a total of 15.8 million ha of land suitable for
irrigation is currently equipped for irrigation. Lack of finances
and technical know-how at the district level impair full
exploitation of irrigation opportunities [4]. Weather variability
and climate change have further diminished water volumes
in many water bodies including the Ruaha and Ruvuma
Rivers, which has challenged irrigation and contributed
to increased livestock migration. High production and
marketing risks linked with weather variability have also
discouraged private sector investment in agriculture.
In addition, a number of crop diseases have increased in
incidence, including coffee wilt, batobato (African Mosaic)
in cassava, banana xanthomonas, elihuka, cassava mosaic,
cassava root rot, and maize streak. Such pests and diseases
have particularly high occurrence near water bodies like
Lindi, Kigoma, Mara, Mtwara, and Mwanza [28].
Where subsidies were widely available for farmers, these
have many times contributed to increases in productivity
at the expense of natural resources availability and
quality. For instance, fertilisers contributed significantly to
environmental degradation, in the absence of preliminary
soil tests and capacity building of farmers and extension
workers to ensure appropriate fertiliser use.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Country Profile
The International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural
Commodities and Trade (IMPACT5) was used to analyse the
effects of climate change on agriculture in the country6.
This assessment focused on the three parameters, namely
net trade, crop area (or livestock numbers), and yields, for
scenarios with and without climate change (CC and NoCC).

Results on the impact of climate change on crop area
by 2050, show an increase in banana, cassava, sorghum
and rice cultivated area, with the increase being greater
by 2.3 percentage points (pp), 0.5pp, 1.7pp and 2.4pp
respectively by 2050 under the CC scenario. Maize area will
likely decrease under both scenarios, as also observed in
previous studies [4, 28, 33]. While most crops are likely to
experience an increase in yields over the 2020-2050 period,
the IMPACT model indicates that these will be affected by
climate change. Specifically, yield increases for banana,
beans, cassava, rice, sorghum, and sunflower are expected
to be lower by 3.1pp, 2.8pp, 0.4pp, 0.1pp, 2.9pp, and 5.5pp
respectively compared to a scenario without any further
changes in climate. Maize yields are projected to decrease
under both scenarios but will be 7.7pp less under CC.

The impact of climate change on livestock numbers and
productivity is not anticipated to be significant. Projections
for 2050 show an increase in chicken numbers and egg
production, with these  expected to be 0.2pp and 0.4pp
less respectively under CC than under the NoCC scenario.
Notwithstanding, the livestock sector will be adversely
affected by increases in rainfall which may result in increased
incidence of  livestock pests and diseases7. Droughts may
result in a decline in carrying capacity and a reduced

For this study, some key crops were assessed individually, while cassava and sunflower were assessed under the category of tubers and oil crops respectively due to
unavailability of data. An analysis for fish was not possible owing to the nature of the production system and also unavailability of information.

Diseases likely to increase in incidence include Trypanosomiasis, East Cost Fever (ECF) and Rift Valley Fever (RVF) [34].
Potential economic impacts of climate change
The impact of climate change on net trade in Tanzania (2020-2050) [35]
quantity and quality of forages. Forage scarcity has already
been witnessed in parts of Arusha, Dodoma, Kilimanjaro,
Shinyanga, Mara, Mwanza, Iringa, and Tabora [34].

Given that climate change will influence yields of various
production systems, agricultural trade will be affected by a
combination of supply and demand factors and commodity
prices on global and national markets. Lower import
dependency is expected for banana, cassava and maize by
0.3pp, 0.2pp, and 1.1pp respectively, while rice  imports will
likely be 0.3pp higher under the climate change scenario.
The results also suggest that Tanzania will be able to increase
sorghum exports under both CC and NoCC.
CSA technologies and practices present opportunities
for addressing climate change challenges, as well as for
economic growth and development of the agriculture
sector. For this profile, practices are considered CSA if
they enhance food security as well as contributing to at
least one of the other objectives of CSA (adaptation and/
or mitigation). Hundreds of technologies and approaches
around the world fall under the heading of CSA.
Support through government programmes, international
organisations and NGOs, as well as traditional knowledge
have enabled the implementation of various CSA practices
throughout the country. For crops production systems,
these practices include agroforestry, improved seed varieties
(drought resistant and early maturing), cover cropping,
CSA technologies and practices

Tanzania
Climate change impacts on yield, crop
area, and livestock numbers in Tanzania [35]
in-situ rainwater harvesting, composting, intercropping
(mostly with legumes), organic fertiliser, conservation
agriculture, crop diversification and irrigation [4, 11, 34,
36, 37] among others. For livestock-based production
systems, CSA practices include in-situ fodder conservation,
pasture management and water harvesting using small
dams and wells. Traditional chicken breeds are usually
kept for increasing household resilience, while integrated
aquaculture systems are regarded as an effective household
food security and alternative income source for many
farmers.
Many practices identified in this study, such as crop rotation,
use of manure, cover cropping, mulching, and intercropping
do not require high initial cost and present an opportunity
for widespread adoption. On the other hand, water
harvesting and minimum tillage are knowledge-intensive
and require high initial capital investment. CSA practices
and their expected benefits are also very site-specific;
therefore scale-out strategies require careful consideration
of socio-economic and environmental contexts. Moreover,
most of the CSA investments analysed did not specifically
target issues related to reduction in post-harvest losses,
indicating a need for further research and development of
value-chain approaches to CSA. Biogas production, though
not considered a CSA practice on its own, was identified as
having great potential in the country due to its ability to link
mitigation of methane emissions from livestock manure with
increases in agricultural productivity through application of
biogas slurry.
A key factor that has hindered the dissemination and
promotion of CSA practices is the shortage of quantitative,
empirical evidence of the CSA practices’ impacts on crop
yields, soil and water conservation, farm incomes, and GHG
mitigation for different production systems. Additionally,
many farmers lack adequate technical and financial capacity
to implement knowledge- and capital-intensive practices,
especially where initial costs for infrastructure construction
and equipment are needed. Scaling out results from farm-
field trials is oftentimes challenged by limited monitoring
support from extension workers. The time lag between initial
investments and benefits also constitutes a factor hindering
adoption of some practices.

The following graphics present a selection of CSA practices
with high climate-smartness scores according to expert
evaluations. The average climate-smartness score is
calculated based on the practice’s individual scores on eight
climate-smartness dimensions that relate to the CSA pillars:
yield (productivity); income, water, soil, risks (adaptation);
energy, carbon and nitrogen (mitigation).  A practice can
have a negative/positive/zero impact on a selected CSA
indicator, with 10 (+/-) indicating a 100% change (positive/
negative) and 0 indicating no change. Practices   in the
graphics have been selected for each production system
identified as being key for food security in the country. A
detailed explanation of the methodology can be found in
Annexes 3.

Tanzania
Case study: Linking agricultural mitigation, resilience and
productivity through biogas production
Mr. Aloyce Mhamilawa is a 32-year old farmer living in Itulike village (Njombe). Together with his family — a wife
and four children — he produces apples, avocado, peas and papaya seedlings at small scale, and pine and other
tree seedlings for commercial purposes. Under normal circumstances, they would produce about 50,000 tree
seedlings of different varieties every year, as well as some vegetables for family consumption. Like most low-income
farmers in Tanzania, more than a third of their household income is usually spent on wood fuel for cooking and
lighting purposes.  This example demonstrates the value in partnerships, various dissemination channels and local
participatory knowledge for scaling out and adopting CSA practices. In 2012, through the Sokoine University,
Aloyce’s family benefited from a biogas subsidy project which allowed the building of a biogas digester, with the
aim to completely replace wood fuel and paraffin and to provide sufficient liquid and composted slurry (over two
tons every month) for farming activities. Following the introduction of the digester, the family can now produce over
250,000 tree seedlings a year and earn six times more income, given the use of bio slurry in the nurseries. Moreover,
the family is now able to sell surplus vegetables on the market.
Bio-slurry
can
retain
moisture,
enabling
seedlings to grow fast and remain healthy, even
during harsh climate conditions. Composted
slurry is also be used as an effective fertiliser
for crop cultivation, while liquid slurry is applied
as a top dressing fertiliser and insect repellant,
significantly reducing demand for chemical
fertilisers. By using these techniques, Mr. Aloyce
has been able to reduce fertiliser consumption
from six bags to one bag per year, saving over
Tsh 300,000 seasonally. Additional household
savings of about Tsh 35,000 per month
have come from a reduction in firewood and
charcoal use, traditionally needed for daily farm
activities such as warming water for cows and
boiling of milk. Mr. Aloyce’s family also noticed
an improvement in the household environment,
mostly a reduction in charcoal powder, ash and
smoke owing to use of biogas energy as
opposed to wood.
This initiative is part of an emerging national effort to provide cheap, clean and sustainable energy to vulnerable
households in Tanzania, in a context where more than 94% of the country’s energy requirements is met by biomass
(primarily wood fuel), contributing to increasing deforestation and soil degradation rates, especially in rural areas,
where 80% of the energy is consumed. At the moment, 12,000 biogas digesters have been built with support from
the Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) and in collaboration with the Centre for Agriculture Mechanisation
and Rural Technology (CARMATEC). An additional 10,000 biodigesters are planned to be built by 2017, with finance
from the Norwegian Embassy in Dar es Salaam. Engaging private sector and conducting capacity building on design,
manufacture, use and repair of biogas digesters will be key components in the sustainability of the programme. This
is particularly pertinent given that the biogas programmes have been largely driven by support from national and
international development organisations.
Since the technology provides simultaneous benefits to multiple sectors (energy supply, agriculture, health,
sanitation, environment, and gender) and links with the country’s goals to reduce poverty and stimulate growth of
Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), biogas digesters are now the core of many integrated farming system
strategies. Biogas provides an excellent opportunity to link manure management and controlled grazing of livestock
with improved crop production and productivity, the livestock and crop production aspects being linked by the
integration of biogas digesters. The technology supports the reduction of methane emissions from manure left on
pastures, although no quantitative analysis of the exact emissions reductions has been conducted insofar.

Institutions for CSA in Tanzania
Institutions and policies for CSA
A number of institutions are involved in promoting CSA
in Tanzania. Most of their work is focused on improving
productivity and enhancing adaptation and resilience of
small-scale farmers, in a context where half of the population
still suffers from poverty and one-third is undernourished.
With the exception of the Institute for Environment, Climate
and Development Sustainability (IEDS), who allocates
approximately 35% of the budget to mitigation activities,
most actors view mitigation as a co-benefit of adaptation
interventions rather than a stand-alone objective of their
work. The following graphic highlights key institutions whose
mandated actions and investments promote — directly
or indirectly — one, two or all CSA pillars (productivity,
adaptation and mitigation).
At the national level, environmental planning and policy
formulation are under the mandate the Division of
Environment of the Vice President’s Office (VPO), as
outlined in the Environmental Management Act (EMA) of
2004. The VPO also provides guidelines to various sectors,
raises awareness, and coordinates climate activities in the
country.
In collaboration with the President’s Office, Regional
Administration and Local Government (PO-RALG), the
Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (MALF)
promotes CSA practices such as irrigation and utilisation of
improved varieties. PO-RALG acts as a policy implementation
bridge between sector ministries, government institutions
and local government authorities, being mandated to
implement policies, build capacity, as well as to monitor,
evaluate and provide technical backstopping of CSA
activities at local levels. However, weak coordination still
presents a challenge for efficient technology dissemination.
Together with the VPO, MALF has also formulated CSA policy
documents, such as the National CSA Programme (2015)
and the CSA Guideline (2017). A National Climate-Smart
Agriculture Task Force (NCSATF) was also established and
later transformed into the broader Tanzania Climate-Smart
Agriculture Alliance (TCSAA). The TCSAA is expected
to coordinate CSA initiatives within the framework of the
National CSA Programme.
Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) are supporting
CSA promotion mostly through awareness raising on
climate change; policy advocacy (for example through
the Tanzanian Civil Society Forum on Climate Change
[Forum CC], the National Networks of Farmers’ Groups in
Tanzania [MVIWATA] and Mazingira Network [MANET]8);
as well as through on-farm implementation of agricultural
practices through field trials and farmer trainings (NGOs
like CARE and Sustainable Agriculture Tanzania [SAT]).
Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and Human Network
International (HNI), both international NGOs, have been
piloting the use of cellphones to facilitate farmer access
to information on climate-smart agriculture as a means
of enhancing knowledge and adoption. The Alliance for a
Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) funds CSA interventions,
conducts research on stress-tolerant seeds and has also
played an important role in advocating for private sector
participation in policy-making (such as  the Seed Policy).
A number of research organisations provide support for
CSA  adoption and scale out, including: the International
Rice Research Institute (IRRI), working on development
and promotion of rice varieties tolerant to abiotic stresses
as well as practices that enhance water conservation); the
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) (which
works on enhancing farmer adoption of stress-tolerant
varieties), the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), the
Tanzania Horticulture Association (TAHA) (with a focus on
sustainable water management, IPM and agroforestry), the
Zanzibar Agricultural Research Institute (ZARI) (working
on drought-tolerant and salt water-tolerant seeds and
short-lived varieties in Zanzibar), among others. Academic

20
Climate-Smart Agriculture Country Profile
institutions such as the Sokoine University of Agriculture
and University of Dar es Salaam are also actively engaged in
research on CSA practices and technologies.
In terms of private sector, The Southern Agriculture Growth
Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) is a private-public regional
partnership that promotes CSA-related agribusiness
development among small scale farmers, as an avenue
for improving food security, reducing rural poverty, and
ensuring
environmental
sustainability.
Organisations
such as the Tanzania Horticultural Association (TAHA) are
involved in climate change related dialogue at national
level. The Centre for Agriculture Mechanisation and Rural
Technology (CARMATEC) is involved in various initiatives
related to CSA including biogas, solar vegetable driers and
rainwater harvesting among others.
International organisations supportive of CSA in the country
include United Nations bodies and international development
agencies. Through its new Social, Environmental and
Climate Assessment Procedures (SECAP) IFAD incorporates
climate change into its projects’ design. IFAD’s key projects
related to climate change in Tanzania include the Southern
Highlands Milk Sheds Development Project and the Drylands
Development Project.
Lack of financial and human resources was reported to
be the biggest institutional challenge for CSA scale-out.
Evidence also points to little collaboration and coordination
among institutions in undertaking CSA interventions, as a
significantly large number of organisations were not aware
of the work of other organisations carrying out similar
activities in the field.
At the policy level, Tanzania adhered to several international
and regional initiatives on climate change, including the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Africa
Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), the East
Africa Community Food Programme of 2011 and the East
African Community Climate Change Policy of 2009. In 2015,
Tanzania submitted its INDC to the UNFCCC, specifically
targeting “Increasing yields through inter alia climate-smart
agriculture”, as a key strategy for climate change adaptation.
There were about 25 national documents that make
reference to climate change adaptation and mitigation in
Tanzania in 2015 [9], including agriculture, forestry and
environmental policies.
The National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA)
of 2007 was the first document to acknowledge climate
change as an important threat to the economy, providing
a first stimulus for sectoral intervention to address climate
impacts. However, the implementation of NAPA was
hampered by the lack of a clear   funding strategy to finance
the identified interventions. The roadmap for climate change
action in the agricultural sector was consolidated in the
National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) of 2012 and the
Agriculture Climate Resilience Plan (ACRP) formulated in
2014, which mainly aimed at improving water use efficiency
and promoting land, soil and water management, climate
resilient crop varieties, and disaster risk management
strategies, among others. Nevertheless, only 20% of the
finances required to implement the plan have been coming
from the government, challenging the financial sustainability
of the interventions.
Complementary to these, the National Agricultural Policy
(NAP) from 2013 seeks to increase productivity and
farmers’ adaptive capacity through reduced dependency on
rainfall, increased private sector investment in agriculture,
improvement of road infrastructure problems and promotion
of new energy sources, such as biofuels. The more recent
CSA Programme and the CSA Guideline represent innovative
policy mechanisms to advance CSA on the public agenda,
tracing a variety of potential CSA technologies and practices
applicable to various AEZs in the country, as a first step
towards more comprehensive, evidence-based analysis and
prioritisation of interventions.
Other policy frameworks, programmes and strategies
supportive of increased productivity and resilience in the
agriculture sector include:
•
The Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS)
(2001), designed to increase farm incomes, and reduce
poverty through increasing productivity. The major
areas of intervention included institutional framework
strengthening, increased private sector engagement
and streamlining of agricultural marketing to enhance
commercialisation.
•
The Agricultural Sector Development Programme
(ASDP) I and II (2006 and 2015), which sought
agricultural
sector
growth
particularly
through
development of irrigation infrastructure, investments in
research (science and technology), value addition, and
mechanisation.
•
The Tanzania National Strategy for Growth and
Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP) I and II (2005/2006-
2009/2010 and 2010/2011-2014/2015), aimed at
improving living standards, reducing poverty, increasing
economic growth and enhancing good governance.
•
Kilimo Kwanza (Agriculture First) of 2009, an initiative
to accelerate modernisation and commercialisation in
the agricultural sector.
•
The Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania
(SAGCOT), initiated in 2010 to increase farmer incomes,
reduce poverty, promote food security, and ensure
environmental sustainability through agribusiness.
•
The Livestock Sector Development Strategy of 2010,
which contributed to the development of plans to settle
pastoralists, the establishment of disease-free zones,
and rehabilitation of livestock-holding grounds, among
others.
•
The Livestock Sector Development Programme (LSDP)
launched in 2011, which targeted increased incomes

21
Tanzania
Policies for CSA in Tanzania
from the livestock sub-sector through improved
input and service delivery and enhanced marketing
infrastructure, among others. In addition, in the
livestock sector,
•
The Tanzania Livestock Master Plan of 2016, which
seeks to increase red meat, milk, poultry and pork
productivity
through
addressing
environmental
conservation issues.
At times, despite the wealthy policy framework, the lack of
a clear development pathway for the agriculture sector has
resulted in inconsistent growth. Furthermore, coordination
of policies and interventions remain a challenge, often
resulting in a sectoral manner of policy development
and implementation as well as a project rather than a
programmatic approach to implementation of interventions
on the ground.
Financing CSA
Every year, the economic costs of climate change on the
agriculture sector amount to US$ 200 million [38], a much
greater sum than that required for building resilience of the
sector, estimated at US$ 100-150 million per year [39]. The
economic losses from climate change are estimated to be
eight times the sum needed to implement the ACRP [4].
Despite these factors, national expenditure on climate change
and CSA in particular remains low. Only a few actors, namely
the Rural Energy Agency (REA), the Tanzania Agriculture
Development Bank (TADB), the Private Agricultural Sector
Support (PASS), and the Tanzania Commission for Science
and Technology (COSTECH), have reportedly received
public finances for climate change interventions in recent
years. Notwithstanding previous policy commitments, there

22
Climate-Smart Agriculture Country Profile
Financing opportunities for CSA in Tanzania
is no direct involvement of the Ministry of Finance and
Planning in the design of governmental CSA interventions
and no national climate funding mechanisms has been
established sofar. Moreover, private sector engagement in
CSA financing is minimal, possibly due to a perceived risk
and lack of profitability of funding agricultural adaptation
and mitigation programme.
As a result, most of the current climate funding (78%)
comes from development partners [40], yet access to funds
is still limited by stringent criteria and complex application
procedures, as well as limited awareness of available funds
[41]. Despite this, between 2003 and 2014, Tanzania
managed to solicit over US$ 200 million through international
climate financing instruments [28]. Most recently, the Green
Climate Fund Board approved the US$ 109 million Climate
Resilience project focusing on sustainable land and water
management in agriculture in the Simuyu region.
Tanzania has done good work to lay the foundation for
attracting large scale finance for climate-smart agriculture
in the country with the development of the National CSA
Programme and National CSA Guideline. However, more
finance needs to be directed towards addressing CSA
adoption barriers. The promotion of farmers groups
and cooperatives, complemented by capacity building
on financial and business management could enhance
smallholders’ access to credit, particularly from micro-
finance institutions. This could add to the existing domestic
funding sources such as the TADB, which mostly finances
large-scale agricultural investments in the country.
Stronger public-private partnerships, from policy formulation
to activity implementation so as to ensure ownership and
sustainability, can also increase the availability of CSA
funds. Engagement of such actors in new areas, such as
renewable energy services, input supply, and post-harvest
activities (processing/value-addition and commercialisation)
can complement existing efforts focused on the production
stage, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive
agricultural sector growth strategy.
Additional sources for international climate financing need
to be explored. For instance, Tanzania has yet to access
funds from the Africa Climate Change Fund (ACCF) and the
Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP)
both of which the country is eligible.
Most importantly, domestic budget allocation towards CSA
will be an important catalysing instrument for agriculture
and climate change related financing in the country. Some
countries in Eastern Africa are setting up national climate
change funds (FONERWA in Rwanda) which aim to merge
finances from various sources, for enhanced coordination
and targeting purposes. Such initiatives can serve as a
model for a potential national climate change financing
mechanism in Tanzania.

Tanzania’s efforts to advance climate change on the public
agenda has been notable, as evident in the numerous
policies, strategies and programs that the government has
put in place for increasing farmers’ resilience and productivity
and promoting CSA adoption. Nevertheless, policy and
institutional alignment and coordination have yet to be fully
achieved, and there is absence of a functional mechanism
to incentivise and enhance collaboration among different
actors. The Tanzania Climate-Smart Agriculture Alliance
represents a critical opportunity to provide such space for
dialogue; therefore, more efforts to support the operation
of such a platform, both financially and technically, are
needed. Development of a comprehensive database of CSA
actors and their interventions could be a first step towards
improved coordination on CSA in the country.
CSA scale-out also requires an operational financing
strategy to ensure continuity and sustainability of current
initiatives. While exploring new international funds may
increase the CSA financing basket, a stronger engagement
Outlook
Works cited
of national public and private sector actors in enabling long-
term financing for small-scale farmers is crucial for the
development of a robust agricultural sector.
Ensuring gender equity in implementation of CSA
interventions will also contribute to increased resilience
of the population. Research on the gendered impacts of
climate change as well as the appropriateness and adoption
constraints of different CSA technologies and practices
by gender, can be a good starting point in ensuring that
identified practices benefit and can be easily adopted by
both men and women.
Moreover, further investments in collecting, analysing and
disseminating evidence of the impacts of CSA practices in
relation to CSA goals are needed, in order to inform more
targeted, relevant interventions for the different production
systems and AEZs. Such evidence would also create further
incentives for increased private sector engagement in CSA,
including micro-finance institutions.
