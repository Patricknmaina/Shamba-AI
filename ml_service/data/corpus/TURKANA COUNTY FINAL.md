Agriculture is the main source of livelihood in Turkana County. It creates more than 74% of household
incomes and employs more than 45% of the population.
Most farmers rely on pastoralism and rain-fed agriculture. This makes them more vulnerable to
climate change and variability.
The effects of climate change in Turkana County include unpredictable rainfall, extreme
rainfall, frequent and prolonged dry spells, and increased daytime temperatures.
Climate hazards that have been observed in the county include drought, floods,
and intense rainfall. These hazards pose a growing threat to the agricultural
sector.
Drought and heat stress are major threats to Turkana County that often
result in loss of pasture, starving livestock, drying water sources, and
conflict among pastoralists over resources.
Heavy rains in the Mt. Elgon and West Pokot regions of the county
and intense rainfall over short periods of time create flooding. On-
farm adaptation strategies include conservation agriculture, rainwater
harvesting, fodder conservation, and planting early-maturing and
drought-tolerant crops as well as drought-resistant and high-value
livestock breeds.
Off-farm adaptation strategies include education and research on climate-
smart agriculture practices, early warning systems and climate-based
advisories, extension services, livestock and crop insurance, afforestation,
and reforestation.
Women and youth contribute significantly to certain value chains. It is therefore
important to promote the involvement of women and youth, and support their
economic gains, decision-making powers, and participation.
Inadequate resources and poor coordination between different institutions in has
undermined Turkana County’s ability to adapt to climate change.
The establishment of community action groups and the support of governmental institutions and
stakeholders has empowered Turkana’s farmers to help protect the environment and use natural
resources sustainably

Foreword
The mandate of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Co-operatives is to create an enabling
environment for sustainable development of agriculture and co-operatives for economic development. This
objective underpins our desire and commitment to transform Kenya into a newly industrializing, middle income
country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens in a clean and secure environment as envisaged in our
development blueprints, the Kenya Vision 2030, the Big Four Agenda and the Agricultural Sector Transformation
and Growth Strategy (ASTSG 2019 – 2029).  The sector remains high on the national development agenda in
terms of food and nutrition security, income generation, employment creation, saving and investment mobilization
and export earnings. To realize the country’s aspirations of food and nutrition security, the Government through
this Ministry is implementing the National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Growth Project (NARIGP) with the
support of the World Bank. The development objective of the project is to increase the agricultural productivity
and profitability of targeted rural communities in 21 counties and in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency,
provide an immediate and effective response.
The agriculture sector is however, highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and extreme weather
events. Responses that would enable the country to cope with these risks are outlined in the Kenya Climate-Smart
Agriculture (CSA) Strategy and in the commitments of the Kenya Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In 2010, the Government developed
the National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) which recognized the impacts of climate change on
the country’s development. This was followed by the development of the National Climate Change Action Plan in
2012. The focus of these initiatives include the development of county-level climate risk profiles to mainstream
climate change perspectives in programs and development plans at county level.  The Ministry has developed
county climate risk profiles in 31 counties and NARIGP is supporting the development of profiles for an additional
14 counties. The purpose of the profiles is to inform county governments and stakeholders on the climate change
risks and provide opportunities for integration into respective county development plans and processes.
This climate risk profiles study will be used as a basis to climate proof projects or any other developments in
fourteen counties (Samburu, Turkana, Kitui, Narok, Kirinyaga, Kiambu, Muranga, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia,
Nandi, Vihiga, Kisii, Nyamira and Migori). The study provides information on current and possible future climate
scenarios, climate-related vulnerabilities and risks for key major agricultural value chains, policy landscape and the
institutional capacity to deliver adaptation programs. Each profile presents adaptation and risk reduction options
that can transform and reorient agricultural systems in the counties to increase productivity, enhance smallholder
farmers’ resilience and mitigate against climate change.
Finally, I call upon all stakeholders for their cooperation and support for adoption of CSA production practices
that maximize the triple wins: increases productivity, enhanced resilience and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Through the adoption of new technologies and improved practices, we will realize the desired goal of
Kenya being a food and nutrition secure country, fostering socio-economic development and improved livelihoods
of Kenyans.

1. Introduction
Climate change is becoming one of the most serious
challenges to Kenya. The country is susceptible to
climate-related events, and projections indicate that
climate impacts will continue to affect the country in the
future. In many areas, extreme and variable weather is
now the norm. Rainfall is irregular and unpredictable;
some regions experience frequent droughts during the
long rainy season or severe floods during the short rains.
Arid and semi-arid areas are particularly vulnerable to
these extreme changes, putting the lives and socio-
economic activities of millions of households at risk.
The Kenya Vision 2030 is a national blue print that
seeks to transform Kenya into a newly middle-income
country providing a high quality of life to all its
citizens by 2030 in a clean and secure environment.
Agriculture sector has been identified as one of the key
sectors to contribute to the projected annual national
economic growth. However, it has been constrained
with inadequate access to quality inputs, marketing
inefficiencies, non-conducive investment environment,
declining soil fertility, low mechanization, land
fragmentation and more significantly climate change.
In 2010, Kenya developed a National Climate Change
Response
Strategy
(NCCRS)
which
recognized
the importance of climate change impacts on the
country’s development. This was followed in 2012 by
the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP),
which provided a means for implementing the NCCRS
and highlighted agricultural adaptation priorities.
These initiatives are focused on the national level,
and climate change considerations still need to be
mainstreamed in county-level policies, programs,
and development plans. Locally relevant, integrated
adaptation responses with active involvement of local
stakeholders are necessary to achieve this goal.
Through the Ministry of Agriculture, the Government of
Kenya (GOK) is implementing the National Agricultural
and Rural Inclusive Growth Project (NARIGP) with
support from the World Bank. The project development
objective is to increase agricultural productivity and
profitability of targeted rural communities in selected
counties To address the climate change risks and
vulnerabilities that negatively impact agricultural
production, the Alliance of Bioversity International and
the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)
completed a climate risk assessment in 14 counties
supported by NARIGP. The aim of the assessment
is to provide information on current climate and
possible future climate scenarios; to identify climate-
related vulnerabilities and risks for major agricultural
value chains and specific groups of people involved
in agriculture; to identify adaptation options that
address climate risks/vulnerabilities; and to assess the
institutional capacity to deliver adaptation programs.
This climate risk profile seeks to inform county
governments and stakeholders about climate change
risks and opportunities for agriculture so they can
integrate these perspectives into county development.
This report will help county governments and
stakeholders integrate climate change risks and
opportunities for local agriculture into county
development plans.
The Alliance undertook the assessment in a set of
interrelated stages (Figure 2). It first initiated a desk
review of the conceptual and analytical contexts of
climate change risks at the national and county levels.
It made efforts to involve a wide range of institutions
that have worked on climate change at the national
and regional levels. The team used globally available
data sources like the Kenya Open Data Portal and
county development plans, and collected information
from relevant government departments, such as the
Department of Resource Surveys and Remote Sensing,
the Kenya Meteorological Department, and the
Drought Monitoring Centre. The team also collected
data through focus group discussions, key informant
interviews with carefully selected experts, climate
modeling, and three days of sub-national stakeholder
workshops. The final reports were then presented and
validated by national- and county-level stakeholders.

Turkana County
This document presents the Climate Risk Profile for
Turkana County. It is organized into six main sections,
each reflecting an essential analytical step towards
understanding current and potential adaptation options
in key local agricultural value chain commodities. The
document first offers an overview of the agricultural
commodities key to food security and livelihoods in the
county, and then lists major challenges to agricultural
sector development in Turkana. In the second
section, it identifies the main climate hazards, based
on an analysis of historical climate data and climate
projections. These include scientific assessments
of climate indicators for dry spells, extreme rainfall,
moisture stress, and heat stress, among others. Third,
the report continues with an analysis of vulnerabilities
and risks posed by these climactic hazards on the
identified value chains. Based on these vulnerabilities,
the fourth section discusses current and potential on-
farm adaptation options and off-farm services. In the
fifth section, the report also provides snapshots of the
enabling policy, institutional, and governance contexts
for the adoption of resilience-building strategies. Finally,
the sixth section presents pathways for strengthening
institutional capacity to address climate risks.
2. County Context
Turkana County covers 68,233 km2 of land and
2,279 km2 of water (KNBS, 2019b; Turkana County
Government, 2013). It is the second-largest county in
Kenya. It lies 1,138 meters above sea level (Turkana
County Government, 2013). The county is located
in the north-western part of Kenya. Lake Turkana,
located in the east of the county, is the world’s largest
permanent desert lake and lies 360 meters above sea
level (Ojwang et al., 2016). The county borders Marsabit
County to the east, West Pokot and Baringo Counties
to the south, and Samburu County to the southeast. It
also borders Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the
north and Ethiopia to the northeast (Turkana County
Government, 2013). It lies between longitudes 34° 30’
and 36° 40’ east, and between latitudes 1° 30’ and 5°
30’ north.
Turkana County is mostly arid, with a warm to hot
climate. The southern areas are categorized as semi-
humid to semi-arid (NDMA, 2016; Wiesmann et al.,
2014). The temperature ranges from 20°C to 41°C,
with a mean of 30.5°C (Turkana County Government,
2018). Turkana County has distinct agroecological
zones that vary in humidity and temperature.
The county has rivers, low-lying, open plains, and
mountain ranges. There are three main rivers in
Turkana County, and they all drain into Lake Turkana.
The river Turkwel flows from Mt. Elgon at the border
of Kenya and Uganda, the river Omo flows from
southern Ethiopia, and the river Kerio flows from the
Amasya Hills at the west of Lake Bogoria. The Songot,
Mogila, Kalapata, Silale, Loriu, Kailongol, Loima, and
Lorengippi mountain ranges are normally covered with
green vegetation, high woody cover, and dense bushes.
These ranges support wood and charcoal production,
honey production, and grazing during the dry season.
The open lying plains are arid and experience the least
rainfall in the County at 180 mm/year (Turkana County
Government, 2018). These plains grow grass and
dwarf shrubs shortly after the rainy season (Turkana
County Government, 2013).
There are two rainy seasons: the long rainy season and
the short rainy season. The former occurs between April
and July, and the latter occurs between October and
November. The county receives an annual average of
200 mm of rainfall. The months of January, February,
and September are usually the driest months. Low
rainfall and high temperatures, coupled with high
rates of evapotranspiration, result in salt and hard
pans on the soil surface. Because of this, only 30%
of the county’s soil is suitable for farming (Turkana
County Government, 2018). The county’s rainfall is
erratic and unreliable. Furthermore, heavy storms and
catastrophic flash floods can occur. Heavy rains over
short periods of time can also cause flooding (NDMA,
2016).
2.1 Economic Relevance of Farming
Agriculture is the main livelihood in Turkana County,
where it is practiced for both subsistence and
commercial purposes. Furthermore, about 25% of
the county’s population derives their livelihoods from
agriculture (Turkana County Government, 2018). A
majority of the county’s income (67%) comes from
livestock, while 4% comes from crop farming, and 3%
comes from fish farming (Turkana County Government,
2018).
The county’s has 2.5 million ha of arable land.
Currently, 435,576 ha of this is used for agriculture;
366,142 ha is used for subsistence farming, and
1,484 has is used for commercial production (KNBS,
2019c). The county’s livestock consists of 1.5 million
cows, 6 million goats, 3.5 million sheep, 0.8 million
camels, 0.2 million poultry birds. (Turkana County
Government, 2013). Additionally, there are also
32,581 beekeeping apiaries in the county (Turkana
County Government, 2013). Food crops are cultivated
along bodies of water (e.g., Kerio and Turkwel rivers).
The county is also home to a few, scattered rain-fed
and irrigated farms. Each year, the county produces
10 million liters of milk (valued at KSh 165 million1),
286 million kg of beef (valued at KSh 130 million), 162
million kg of mutton (valued at KSh 24 million), 0.4
million kg of poultry meat, and 3 million eggs (valued
KSh 45 million) (Turkana County Government, 2018).
Lake Turkana, the Kerio and Turkwel rivers, and other
seasonal rivers provide fish.

Figure 3: Agriculture and Livelihoods in Turkana County
2.2 People and Livelihoods
Turkana County has a total population of 926,976
people (Figure 3); 51.6% are males and 48.4% are
females according to the 2019 census (KNBS, 2019a).
There are 164,519 households, and the average
household consists of 5.6 people. The county has
7 sub-counties: Kibish, which is home to 4% of the
county’s population, Loima, which is home to 11.6%,
Turkana Central, which is home to 20%, Turkana East,
which is home to 14.9%; Turkana North, which is
home to 7%, Turkana South, which is home to 16.6%,
and Turkana West, which is home to 25.9% (KNBS,
2019a).
About 37% of Turkana’s households are involved in
farming. Of these households, 25% practice subsistence
farming and 0.4% practice commercial farming
(KNBS, 2019b). Out of all farming households, 93%
are involved in livestock production, 23% are involved in
crop production, 0.7% are involved in aquaculture (fish
farming in controlled aquatic environments), 7% are
involved in fishing, and 8% are involved in in irrigation.
The average farm in Turkana County is between

9
Turkana County
0.8 ha and 2 ha large. The labor force in Turkana
County consists of 332,100; 150,500, or 45%, of this
population is employed in small-scale agriculture and
pastoralism. Turkana County’s agriculture has great
potential (Turkana County Government, 2018, ASDSP,
2014). Its main crops include maize, millet, sorghum,
and vegetables, which are farmed at the household
level along the rivers Kerio and Turkwel.
The county has several urban centers: Lodwar,
Lokori, Lokichoggio, Kakuma, Kalokol, Logurum and
Lokitaung. There are also many settlements near Lake
Turkana. The county’s rural population is 760,374;
of this population, 363,787 (48%) are females and
396,587 (52%) are males (KNBS, 2019b). The
population is denser in the urban areas, especially
in Turkana Central Constituency and the county’s
capital, Lodwar Town. Turkana West Constituency
has the highest population because it is home to a
refugee camp. The county averages 14 persons per
km² (KNBS, 2019), which is an increase from 2013’s
recorded 12 persons per km2.
The county’s labor force consists mainly of youth (ages
15 to 29) and constitutes 49% of the entire population
of the county. The labor force mainly consists of
unskilled labor. The county’s employment rate is 70%,
compared to the national rate of 42%. The county’s
dependency ratio (the percentage of the population
who are not in the labor force) is 31% (KNBS, 2014).
Mining is a key source of livelihood in Turkana County.
This includes small-scale gold mining, oil mining,
and gemstone and mineral mining (Turkana County
Government, 2013). Road construction employs
more than 500. The county’s minor roads are in poor
condition. This adversely affects economic activities,
especially during the rainy seasons.
In Turkana County, the absolute poverty rate is 79% and
food poverty rate is 73% (Turkana County Government,
2018). Nationally, the county is ranked third in terms
of poverty contribution, with an estimated 87.5% of
the population living below the poverty line (below
USD 1.90 per day). Due to its residents’ inadequate
and unbalanced diets, Turkana records high levels of
Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) and Severe Acute
Malnutrition (SAM). In June 2019, GAM rates were at
25.6%, while in June 2018 they were at 18.1%. In June
2019, SAM rates were at 5.9% and in June 2018, they
were at 4.1% (Turkana County Government, 2019).
According
to
the
Turkana
County
Integrated
Development Plan of 2018-2022, the main water
sources in the county are rivers and boreholes. Other
sources include wells, springs, water pans, roof
catchments, and rock catchments. Urban areas have
piped water that is serviced by boreholes and pumped
using solar power and generators at night. Currently,
there are 1,267 boreholes, 129 water pans, 531 shallow
wells, 35 unprotected springs, 10 protected springs,
and 6,819 roof catchments in the county (Turkana
County Government, 2018). Currently, 66,085, or 7%,
of households have access to safe water, and 12,119, or
1%, have access to piped water. The average distance
to the nearest water source is 10 km. Settlements
can be located up to 20 km away from water sources.
Currently, 30% of households get drinking water from
streams and rivers, 21% of households get drinking
water from standpipes, 13% get water from boreholes
or tube holes, 12% get water from unprotected wells,
6% get water piped into their plot, 6% get water from
a dam or lake, 3% get water from a protected well, 3%
get water from vendors, 3% get water piped into their
home, 1% get water from an unprotected spring, 1%
get water from a protected spring, 0.2% get water by
harvesting rain,.1% buy bottled water, 0.7% get water
from a pond (KNBS, 2019b).
2.3 Agricultural Activities
Certain areas of Turkana County are unsuitable for
farming and only viable for activities like livestock
rearing and settlement. (ASDSP, 2014). There are
three distinct farming systems in the county. These
systems are based on the characteristics of different
agroecological zones  (Figure 4). These systems are:
pastoralism that is present across all the agroecological
zones, while small-scale farming and mixed farming
systems are concentrated in the tropic-cool/subhumid
and tropic-warm/subhumid agroecological zones
(ASDSP, 2014). Irrigation is widespread in Turkana
Figure 4: Map of Agroecological Zones in Turkana County

10 Kenya County Climate Risks Proﬁles Series
County and is mainly practiced by small-scale farmers.
Water Resource Users Associations direct that water
should be used first for domestic purposes, then for
livestock, then for irrigation. However, there is barely
enough for water in the rivers for domestic and
livestock purposes. Additionally, very few farmers
harvest rainwater for irrigation.
Most land is held in trust for the community by the
Turkana County Government. However, there are
reports that several people have purchased land for
commercial development (KNBS, 2014). There are
no reported of landless persons in Turkana County;
in the rural areas, land is communally owned. In the
urban centers, the local authority allots land for a
fee. The county government holds the forest cover
in trust; local communities can utilize its resources
without restrictions. Currently, the county has only one
gazetted forest, the Loima Forest. The gazetting of the
Songot Hills forest2 is underway.
The main crop value chains in Turkana County are
maize, millet, sorghum, cowpeas, and mung beans.
Other crops include local vegetables, date palm,
spinach, bananas, kale, and tomatoes. Most of these
crops are farmed at the household level along the
banks of the rivers Kerio, Tarach, Malimalite, and
Turkwel. Farmers in Turkana County use relatively
low amounts of agricultural supplies (ASDSP, 2014).
Livestock rearing is very common in the county. The
livestock are usually indigenous breeds of cows, goats,
sheep, camels, donkeys, and poultry (Turkana County
Government, 2018).
Many farmers in Turkana County grow fruit trees.
The county’s Katilu Irrigation Scheme grows banana,
guava, mango, orange, and pawpaw trees (Turkana
County Government, 2018).
2.4 Important Value Chains
Several of Turkana County’s value chains are
prioritized by the County Integrated Development
Plan, the National Agricultural Rural Inclusive Growth
Project, the Agricultural Sector Development Support
Program, and the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock
Research Organization. For this profile, the county’s
major value chains were compiled into a list using
the following indicators: productivity characteristics,
including harvested area, production, and production
variations in the past five years; economic value
(KSh); and nutrition characteristics like dietary energy
consumption (Kcal/capita/day) and protein, iron, zinc,
and vitamin A content. The team presented this list to
stakeholders during a three-day workshop for in-depth
analysis and selection. We further honed the selection
using a set of criteria which were first determined with
the stakeholders. The criteria were resilience to current
and future climate change impacts, on a scale from
low to high; the percentage of population involved in
the value chain (%); and involvement in the value chain
of economically and socially vulnerable groups such
as poor people, women, and youths, again measured
on a scale from low to high. First, we assessed each
value chain against each criterion. Then, we selected
the value chains that involved the highest percentage
of the population and engaged poor people, women,
and youths. For this profile, the county’s major value
chains were compiled into a list using the following
indicatorsps The value chains that they selected are:
sheep and goats, local chicken, sorghum, and fish.
2.4.1 Sheep and Goats
Between 81-100% of the county’s population is
involved in the sheep and goats value chain. That
means almost every household keeps sheep and
goats. This value chain involves both small-scale and
large-scale actors; for example, the vaccine, medicine
and feed suppliers are small-scale. Farmers also
depend on herbal medicine to treat their animals. Most
farmers keep huge numbers of animals. Wholesalers
and retailers sell live animals in bulk within and outside
the county. Slaughterhouses operate on a large scale
basis and butcheries operate on a small-scale basis in
Turkana County.
Most farmers in Turkana use few supplies, or inputs, in
this value chain. For example, as stated, most farmers
depend on herbal medicine to treat animals. This
means that they do not buy medicine inputs for their
livestock. Men are less involved on-farm than women
and youth. This is because, traditionally, it is the duty
of women and youth to take care of sheep and goats.
Men are somewhat involved at the post-production
stage; men and the youth become more involved at
slaughterhouses and butcheries. Men and youth are
highly involved in transporting, marketing, and selling
the animals.
Whereas land and fodder are mostly communally
owned and shared, other inputs, such as feed, must
be obtained by individual farmers. The Department
of Development, its partners, and the farmers carry
out major activities like breeding, deworming, and
vaccinating.
Processors,
transporters,
butchers,
middlemen,
wholesalers,
and
brokers
become
important in later stages of the value chain. Farmers,
wholesalers, the government, middlemen, development
partners, and processors carry out marketing, linking,
buying, and selling activities
2.4.2 Local Chicken
Between 61 and 80% of Turkana County’s population
is involved in the local chicken production chain. Local
chicken is reared on a small scale across the county.
Local chicken meat and eggs support food security in
the county. Poultry farming in individual homesteads
is mainly controlled by women and youth. They clean
2 Gazetted: published in an official gazette, such as the Kenya gazette

Turkana County
poultry houses, feed the birds, select and grade eggs,
sell eggs, and process chicken meat. Men are often
involved in obtaining vaccines, cleaning and spraying
poultry sheds, preparing feed, and providing water,
but rarely engage beyond these activities. Eggs and
chicken meat are consumed and also sold.
At the production stage, farmers acquire feed,
veterinary services, and breeding materials from the
Department of Livestock, vendors, and agro-vets. The
Department of Livestock, the Caritas Lodwar charity,
and the International Livestock Research Institute
play important roles at this stage. The Department
of Veterinary Services and agro-vets in the areas of
Silo and Sidai supply chicken feed, vaccines, and
medicines on a medium-scale basis. There are also
chicken cooperatives, supported by the Technology
Conservation Group. Processing happens on a small-
scale basis, as most chicken is consumed at the
household level.
On farms, farmers carry out vaccinations and feeding
and build housing for their birds. Local chicken is
mainly raised free-range. However, parasites, diseases,
and unfavorable weather conditions have made poultry
farmers reconsider the viability of free ranging. Local
chicken does well during warm weather. However,
farmers are forced to house their chicken during very
hot days, drought, and floods. Success in poultry
farming largely depends on the quality and availability
of inputs like vaccines, medicine, and feeds, and
proper practices like proper housing.
Post-production, farmers transport their chickens
to markets, slaughter, and process meat. Although
farmers transport their goods throughout the county,
slaughtering and processing activities are concentrated
in areas like Lodwar, Kakuma, Lokichoggio, Eliye
Springs, Kainuk, and Lokichar. Restaurants buy a lot of
chicken meat. In towns like Lodwar, Kakuma, Lokichar,
Lokori, and Lokichoggio, farmers, development
partners, and chambers of commerce engage in
selling, promotion, and marketing at the local level.
To deal with problems in pricing and quality, farmers
form groups like the Nateleng Group to standardize
chicken prices, process through freezing, and better
market their produce. These groups are successfully
streamlining the poultry value chain.
2.4.3 Sorghum
Most of Turkana County’s population (61-80%) is
involved in the sorghum value chain; it is a traditional
crop in Turkana County. It is also drought-tolerant
and fast growing. Sorghum production is optimized
through intercropping with cowpeas, another early-
maturing and drought-tolerant crop. Intercropping
ensures that a farmer does not incur a total loss if one
of the crops fails. Intercropping also helps conserve soil
and water and protect against runoff and soil erosion.
Cow peas also improve soil fertility. Youth and women
are involved across all stages of production. Men are
generally uninvolved in this value chain.
The suppliers, farmers, and wholesalers/retailers in this
value chain operate on a small-scale basis. Farmers
mainly use their own seeds. The government and
some non-governmental organizations provide limited
amounts of seeds. Sorghum is grown on small plots,
with no inorganic fertilizer, under rain-fed conditions.
Farmers who live along rivers irrigate during dry spells.
Most sorghum is grown for consumption. However, a
few sorghum flour mills have recently been established
in Loyal, Etic and Morulem.
The Department of Agriculture, in collaboration with
other programs like the Agricultural Sector Development
Support Program and National Agricultural and Rural
Inclusive Growth Project, provides help to sorghum
farmers. Farmers also acquire equipment and tools
from local markets. Some farmers buy seeds, but
most recycle seeds. On-farm, farmers prepare land,
weed, and harvest. Post-production, the sorghum
is processed, stored, and transported on a small
scale. Oftentimes, youths transport the sorghum
using motorbikes and produce is stored in traditional
granaries constructed within farms, while the surplus
is taken to the National Cereals and Produce Board in
Lodwar Town. At the market, actor price and sell and
link farmers to buyers.
2.4.4 Fish
Fish involves 21-40% of the county’s population.
The fish value chain offers off-farm opportunities
to fishermen, as well as women and youth, who are
involved in cutting, grading, processing, packaging
and transporting. According to the Kenya Maritime and
Fisheries Research Institute, the fish value chain has
the potential to significantly contribute to the national
economy and support Turkana’s population.
Most of the players in the fish value chain are located
near lakes. Fish is consumed locally, and transported
to markets in Nairobi, Kisumu, Lodwar, Busia, Uganda,
Congo, and Tanzania. Most fishing gear suppliers
operate on a medium-scale basis, and are found near
lakes. Most fishermen and processors operate on a
medium-scale basis, although there is one large-scale
processor in the town of Loropio. Wholesalers operate
on a large-scale basis and target external markets like
the Congo, while retailers operate on a medium-scale
basis and target local markets in other counties
The most important input for this value chains is fishing
equipment. Men and male youth are very involved in
procuring equipment. Most suppliers are located in
the Kalokol and Kang’atosa wards. The key players
are private suppliers, the county government, and
its partners (the United States African Development
Foundation
and
the
International
Organization
for Migration). The Kenya Maritime Authority, the
Department of Fisheries, and the Kenya Maritime and

Agricultural value chains in Turkana
Fisheries Research Institute offer education and other
services. Local artisans from the Kalokol, Kang’atosa,
and Kerio wards, build boats. Some farmers own their
fishing gear, while others rent boats and fishing nets
daily.
On-farm, fishermen engage in sorting, cutting, and
washing fish. Youth are very involved in this stage.
Post-production, laborers engage in transportation,
processing, and packaging. Youth are also highly
involved at this stage. Most fish processors are located
near makes. Fishermen and agents then link producers
to buyers. Traders, processors, and middlemen engage
in weighing and grading fish. Middlemen and brokers
collect and store fish. Men, women, and youth are
highly involved in these stages of the value chain.
2.5 Challenges to the Agriculture Sector
Turkana County is prone to climate variability;
prolonged dry spells are becoming the new norm
(Turkana County Government, 2018). The county is
hit hard by drought and famine, which force people
to rely on relief and food donations. Turkana County’s
agriculture is threatened by lack of access to water and
aid, climate-change related soil degradation, aridity,
erosion, a reliance on rain-fed agriculture, and political
roadblocks (Turkana County Government, 2018).
Figure 5: Characterization of  Selected Value Chains in Turkana County

13
Turkana County
Turkana County’s inadequate and unreliable rainfall
fails to adequately support its agricultural activities.
Irrigation is expensive, labor-intensive, and rare in
Turkana County. The county’s size makes it difficult
to allocate limited resources equitably. Furthermore,
during heavy rainfall and floods, the existing water
infrastructure is damaged or destroyed, further
aggravating the problem as noted by the Water
Department in Turkana County.
Turkana County farms are not highly diversified;
farmers mainly depend on livestock like sheep
and goats. Turkana County is culturally inclined to
pastoralism. Overdependence on livestock makes
farmers vulnerable to climate change. The county
government encourages farmers to sell animals before
difficult periods to avoid loss, and to restock during
favorable periods.
The rainy seasons are often late and torrential in
Turkana County. This causes soil erosion and crop
destruction. In extreme cases, floods destroy property
and infrastructure, and displace farming communities.
Heavy rains also form large pools that can drown
humans and livestock. Soil erosion also causes
water pollution, which affects fish breeding grounds.
Conversely, drought affects the quality and quantity of
fish, and leads to overfishing as farmers from other
value chains engage in fishing as an alternative source
of income (ASDSP, 2020).
Farmers are threatened by emerging livestock
diseases, like Lolewo, a goat disease that is caused
by prolonged wet periods, and pneumonia that affects
local chicken. Heat stress hinders livestock growth
and nutrition. Livestock farmers in Turkana County
compete for resources, which leads to conflict. This is
another challenge that the county faces.
Turkana County is further disadvantaged by inadequate
aid and advisory services. Farmers reported that
aid workers historically reached them through field
visits and demonstrations. Today, this type of aid
is threatened by insufficient means of transport,
fewer workers, and inadequate financial support.
Furthermore, the nomadic way of life in the county
makes it difficult to follow-up. As a result, technical
experts and farmers rarely communicate. This leads to
subpar fodder conservation techniques, poultry feed,
pest and disease management, technology use, and
more.
Turkana County also suffers from poor coordination,
overlaps in official duties, and poor communication.
For instance, the county’s Lands Department had
allotted wetlands and riverbank areas to citizens,
despite this being prohibited by the National
Environmental Management Authority. This has
encouraged encroachment on rivers and water
catchment areas. The county government has also
approved major constructions near marshlands,
despite the fact that there are departments that exist
to safeguard marshlands. Because existing policies are
not integrated into plans, Turkana County’s ecosystem
is suffering.
3. Climate Change and
Agriculture: Risks and
Vulnerabilities
In generating this profile, we assessed past trends and
future projections of precipitation and temperature,
and computed several related hazards from these two
variables. These hazards included extreme hydrological
events like flash floods, droughts, moisture stress, heat
stress, and the start and length of the growing seasons,
in order to assess climate change and variability in
Turkana County. The growing season was defined
as follows: the first, long rainy season is the 100-day
wettest period from January to June, while the second,
short rainy season is the 100-day wettest period from
July to December (KMD, 2020).
We used Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
8.5, one of the four greenhouse gas concentration
trajectories adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) for its fifth Assessment
Report (AR5) in 2014. Future climate projections were
generated based on an ensemble of multiple Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models (Taylor
et al., 2012), using RCP 8.5 for two future periods,
2030 and 2050.3
To assess droughts and dry spells, we focused on the
maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD),
defined as days receiving rainfall measuring less than
1mm (precipitation < 1 mm day-1). We determined
heat stress by measuring the total number of days with
maximum temperatures greater than or equal to 35oC
(NT35). Growing days are the days during a season
when average temperatures are greater than or equal
to 5°C and precipitation exceeds half the potential
evapotranspiration. The start of the growing season
was determined by the occurrence of 5 consecutive
growing days, while the length of the growing period
(LGP) was determined as the total number of growing
days.
For each season, heavy precipitation events were
captured with the 5-day running average of rainfall,
indicative of floods, and the 95th percentile of daily
precipitation, indicative of extremely high rainfall over
a short period of time, indicating flash flooding risk.
The 95th percentile of daily precipitation distribution,
based on the 100 wettest days per season per year,
was calculated for each pixel.
To assess the degree adequacy of rainfall and soil
moisture to meet the potential water requirements
3 For historical precipitation and temperature trends, we used the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Climate Hazards Group Infrared
Temperature with Stations (CHIRTS). For future climate projections we used an ensemble of downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) (Taylor et al.,
2012, Navarro-Racines et al 2020), specifically the MOHC_HADGEM2_ES, CESM1_CAM5, GFDL_CM3, MPI_ESM_LR, and MIROC_MIROC5 models

14 Kenya County Climate Risks Proﬁles Series
for agriculture, indicators for drought stress were
examined in terms of the number of consecutive days
in each season where the ratio of actual to potential
evapotranspiration (ETa/ETp) is below 0.5. This
was calculated for each pixel per season per year by
evaluating soil’s water capacity and evapotranspiration
to define the number of days that could undergo a
certain level of stress.
3.1 Climate Change and Variability:
Historic and Future Trends
Historical monthly temperatures in Turkana County
between 20 and 40°C. South-eastern Turkana is
significantly hotter than the rest of the county. The long
rainy season is significantly wetter than the short rainy
season. The dry season runs from the end December
into February. April experiences the most rainfall (more
than 50 mm per month) (Figure 6 and 7).
Up until the 1990s, Turkana County had a favorable
climate for agriculture. The rains were regular and
adequate and, during the long rainy season, the
county would record between 750 mm and 1000 mm
of rainfall. Currently, the county receives an annual
average of 180-200 mm of rainfall and this is projected
to reduce by 2040 during the long rainy season. By
2060, rainfall trends are projected to increase for
both seasons (Figure 8). Flooding is also becoming
a frequent phenomenon, especially during the short
rainy season (Turkana County Government, 2013). The
climate has become very hot and dry, with increased
incidence of drought and famine during the long rainy
season. Temperature trends show a steady increase
during both seasons for climate projections until 2040
and 2060 (Figure 9)
Analysis of temperature changes in Turkana County
since 1985 indicate an increase in heat stress during
the long rainy season. It also indicates a slight increase
in average precipitation and a slight decrease in heavy
rainfall. The data also indicates highly variable levels of
moisture stress and a delayed growing season. During
the short rainy season, the number of consecutive dry
days has significantly decreased. The data also shows
increases in flood risk, rainfall, and heat stress, and a
delayed growing season.
During the long rainy season, most of the county
experiences fewer than 60 consecutive dry days (CDD).
In the future, the county will experience an overall
increase of up to 25 CDD days during this season
(Figure 10). During the short rainy season, most of
the county experiences between 60 to 80 CDD. In the
future, the county will experience an overall decrease
of up to 30 CDD. These changes mean that farmers
should plant early maturing and drought-tolerant
varieties of crops.
During the long rainy season, average precipitation
(P5D) has historically remained below 20 mm (Figure
11). Future climate projections indicate that the P5D
number will increase by between 8 and 10 mm. During
the short rainy season, P5D has historically also
remained below 20 mm. Future climate projections
indicate that P5D will increase by 10 mm or more during
the short rainy season. This increases opportunities for
farmers to engage in flood-based farming.
During the long rainy season, average precipitation
(P5D) has historically remained below 20 mm (Figure
9). Future climate projections indicate that the P5D
number will increase by between 8 and 10 mm. During
the short rainy season, P5D has historically also
remained below 20 mm. Future climate projections
indicate that P5D will increase by 10 mm or more during
the short rainy season. This increases opportunities for
farmers to engage in flood-based farming.
Analysis shows that during the long rainy season,
there are typically more than 70 days with a maximum
temperature greater or equal to 35°C (NT35). Future
climate projections indicate the NT35 number will
marginally increase in some regions, by up to 30 more
days during the long rainy season, and by more than
15 days during the short rainy season . This means that
there will be risk of heat stress, especially to animals
like local chicken, sheep, and goats.
Moisture stress is estimated as the number of days
with a ratio of actual evaporation levels to potential
evaporation levels below 0.5. This ration serves as an
indicator of the amount of soil moisture that is available
to plants. Higher values of moisture stress negatively
affect crop growth. Comparison of historical and future
trends indicates that Turkana County is expected to
experience between 10 and 12 more days of moisture
stress in the future. However, this number will decrease
during the short rainy season, by up to 20 days.
This data offers hope for a productive short rainy
season for farmers. However, poor planning and lack
of education has resulted in farmers that don’t know
when to plant or to acquire inputs. Furthermore,
delayed rain sometimes forces farmers to not plant at
all.

Turkana County
3.2 The Climate from Farmers´
Perspectives
Farmers in Turkana County believe that climate change
is a natural occurrence that has been aggravated by
human activities. Some do not understand climate
change, while others think that it is a curse. Climate
change has brought drought, flooding, intense rainfall,
moisture stress, uncertain planting seasons, and
locusts to Turkana County.
Periods of drought and moisture stress have
necessitated irrigation farming. This has resulted in
a substantial increase in farming along rivers. This
leaves farmers who live downstream with little or no
water. Periods of water shortage periods have resulted
in changing household roles - for example, men going
to look for water or remaining behind to take care of
the homestead and feed the children. Traditionally,
these jobs are reserved for women.
On a positive note, farmers agreed that the increased
rainfall, especially during the short rainy season, has
resulted in increased pasture production. If this pasture
is harvested and stored well, it can provide food for the
livestock during drought periods. The warmer weather
has also given rise to poultry farming; chicken does
well in warm and hot weather.
3.3 Climate Vulnerabilities across Value
Chain Commodities
Moisture stress, drought, extreme rainfall, floods,
increased temperatures, and inconsistent seasons pose
severe threats to Turkana County. The climate hazards
that pose the worst threat to the county are drought,
extreme rainfall, and floods. Moreover, the county has
also in the recent past faced the locust invasion in the
country. The locust plague that has been exacerbated
by atypical weather patterns and which has been
amplified by climate change has mostly hit Turkana
South, followed by Turkana West, Turkana Central and
Loima sub-counties. By devastating farmland and
grazing areas, the crisis has dented the food security
and livelihoods of a great number of residents in
Turkana County.
The sections below highlight the major climate risks
that they pose to the major value chains.
3.3.1 Sheep and Goats
The climate hazards that most effect the sheep and
goats value chain are drought and flood. Sheep and
goats require constant rainfall patterns to provide
adequate pasture and water. During drought, feed
availability is limited, and animals starve. Pests and
diseases also proliferate during droughts. Most farmers
do not have the capital to buy feed, medicine, and
vaccines for their animals. Emaciated animals do not
command good prices during droughts. In addition,
invasive pests like locusts are proliferate during drought
and compete for the little vegetation that is available.
During floods, waterlogged soil affects the development
of pasture. Prosopis spp (local name Mathenge),
an invasive species that thrives in stagnant water,
encroaches grazing land. In extreme cases, floods
sweep away and destroy existing pasture and property,
and drown livestock. Animals are affected by diseases
like coughs and diarrhea during wet periods. Floods
can also block roads. The county government usually
sends out flood warnings through SMS. However, this
is only useful to farmers who own mobile phones. Low
yields reduce marketing and transport activities. This
threatens many livelihoods.
The goats and sheep value chains have also been
affected by the locust invasion in the county. By
destroying vegetation and rangelands, there has been
reduced pastures for the sheep and goats to graze
on in the already arid region. It is estimated that the
decimation of browse by the desert locusts has caused
major harm to the residents, as the sheep and goats
are an essential source of food, nutrition and financial
security to the herding Turkana Community (Guardian
2020).
3.3.2 Local Chicken
Drought and floods affect the chicken value chain in
Turkana County. Flooding reduces the availability and
quality of poultry feeds and hinders production and
transport. Floods also hinder feed production. Wet
weather also makes chickens susceptible to coughs
and diarrhea. This leads to increased chick mortality
and reduced egg production. Veterinary services are
hindered by impassible roads during floods. Farmers
have fewer birds to slaughter and sell for profits during
these times.
Drought also affects feed production through water
shortage. Heat stress results in higher chick mortality.
In addition, high temperatures may cause vaccines
and chicken meat to spoil.  Some farmer groups
have freezers and fridges that use solar panels. Some
farmers prefer to sun-dry their meat during droughts.
Ultimately, droughts mean that farmers have fewer
birds to sell for profit.
3.3.3 Sorghum
Drought and extreme rainfall affect the sorghum value
chain. Although sorghum is a drought-tolerant crop,
it requires moisture to sprout. During drought, hard
pans form on the soil’s surface, and farmers require
additional labor and expensive equipment to break
through. Poor farmers often lack the financial capacity
to break through hard pans. Drought lowers sorghum
production because of delayed planting.

20 Kenya County Climate Risks Proﬁles Series
Extreme rainfall destroys sorghum and washes away
pollen. There is also a chance of severe water-logging
and disruption during extreme rainfall events. Heavy
rains also cause damage to fences and storage
facilities and hinder transportation. Furthermore,
intense rainfall causes damage to produce during
transport and might cause rotting. Heavy rain can also
destroy irrigation infrastructure and increases rates of
pests and disease.
Furthermore, the locust invasion has affected sorghum
production in the county reducing the gains made.
FAO estimates that in the county, there was a 15 to
20 percent damage or reduction of the yield in the
sorghum crop (FAO, 2020).
3.3.4 Fish
Drought and flood affect Turkana County’s fish value
chain. Flooding cuts off road networks, making
it difficult for farmers to receive supplies and aid.
Flooding causes water pollution that destroys fish
breeding grounds. Because of this, processing,
packaging, transportation, grading, and marketing
services are seriously affected during floods.
Persistent
drought
reduces
water
levels
and
compromises water quality, which reduces the number
of fish produced. Drought also affects the availability
of input. For example, raw materials such as timber for
boat making are usually limited during drought periods
due to low demand. Harvesting, cutting, washing,
transportation, processing, packaging, grading, and
marketing activities are all severely affected by this.
4. Adapting to Climate Change
and Variability
4.1 Factors That Determine Future
Vulnerabilities to and Impacts of
Climate Change
Drought affects people differently based on their
coping mechanisms (Mutu, 2017). Farmers who do
not entirely depend on livestock are more likely to
cope well. Farmers can cope with drought through
rainwater by harvesting water and using water pans
and dams. Male farmers who are in a position to
educate themselves will be able to cope better than
women and youth, who are traditionally excluded from
education. Poor farmers are more vulnerable because
they do not have the financial resources to invest in
irrigation or water tanks, and because their houses
often have grass roofs that render rooftop rainwater
harvesting impossible.
The areas which are most vulnerable to flooding include
the lowlands and river areas. Illiterate people are also
more vulnerable to flooding, as they cannot read early
warning bulletins. No policy helps pastoralists procure
vaccines, breeding, and deworming services during
famine periods.
Youth and women are vulnerable to climate change, not
only because they are major players in the local chicken
value chain, but also because they lack the knowledge
and financial resources to adapt to climate change.
Men are more able to attend meetings, listen to the
radio, and read newspapers. Women and youth spend
most of their time on farm or in search of domestic
resources. The less educated are also vulnerable, as
they do not possess the knowledge required to adapt
to climate change. Farmers who live in regions that are
prone to extreme rainfall are also vulnerable. Resource-
poor farmers are also vulnerable to climate change.
The old and illiterate rural population cannot access
off-farm employment and are therefore vulnerable.
In the fish value chain, men are vulnerable to the
effects of climate change, as fishing gear artisans
are predominantly male. Poor fishermen are also
vulnerable, especially when they lose their fishing gear
to floods or when their boats capsize during strong
winds. Women and youth are also vulnerable, as they
are the main players at the post-production and output
stages.
4.2 Adaptation Options
4.2.1 Ongoing Practices
Turkana County is trying to curb some of the effects
of climate change. Various county departments, non-
governmental organizations, and private entities offer
on-farm and off-farm aid services. One of the main
ways to adapt to climate change effects is to ensure
that Turkana County’s farmers are prepared. For
example: farmers are now destocking and restocking
their livestock accordingly and the county promotes
feed production and conservation, water infrastructure
development, and soil conservation.
Destocking and restocking livestock ensure that
farmers can comfortably manage their herds during
climate hazards. There are also breeding initiatives to
introduce hardy animals to Turkana County’s farmers.
The Department of Water and some residents have
drilled boreholes in Turkana County. Some residents
use water pans and dams to store water. Additionally,
water vendors play a key role in meeting the county’s
demands for water. However, the water that they sell is
expensive.
The Department of Agriculture encourages farmers
to grow early-maturing, drought-tolerant, and pest
and disease-resistant varieties of crops. Flood-based
farming is also practiced in Turkana. Vegetable
gardening is also increasing as a supplement to
livestock rearing.

Turkana County
Turkana County farmers also practice soil conservation
practices in order to protect their farms from erosion.
These farmers construct rock or concrete-filled cages
along riverbanks to curb wind and water erosion.
These cages are constructed in collaboration with the
Departments of Agriculture and Water. Tree-planting
activities have also started to gain ground in Turkana
County.
4.2.2 Potential Practices
Farmers, various government departments, the
private
sector,
and
different
non-governmental
organizations can reducing the effects of climate
change through activities such as replanting forests,
engaging in livestock management services and water
management services, education, using climate and
weather advisory services, protecting and conserving
water resources, diversifying farms, and research and
development.
Extension workers can incorporate advisories from
the Kenya Meteorological Department into field
days and demonstrations with farmers. The Kenya
Meteorological Department frequently sends climate-
based advisories to different departments and farmers
through SMS and bulletins. This will help farmers
plan their farming activities accordingly. This will also
help people in the lowlands or areas that are prone
to flooding move to higher and safer areas before
floods begin. The National Drought Management
Authority is also involved in early warning systems,
and uses bulletins and radio adverts (Turkana County
Government, 2018).
Extension services and education initiatives can be
upscaled to include more farmers. Currently, the
Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, and
Cooperatives offers services, but these services do not
reach every farmer in the county, due to inadequate
human and financial resources. The Agricultural
Sector Development Strategy Program, the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the
county government currently promote conservation
agriculture and the use of drought-tolerant plants
(ASDSP, 2014).
Pasture area has recently become significantly rarer in
Turkana County, and farmers must find alternatives to
feed their animals. The Turkana Rehabilitation Project,
the National Drought Management Authority, and
the Livestock Department and its partners offer feed-
production ventures, pasture reseeding, and fodder
production (Turkana County Government, 2018).
However, these feeds can only support a minimal
number of livestock. Another potential solution is
storing sorghum and maize stems to use as fodder.
The Forestry Department, the Kenya Forestry Research
Institute, and the Caritas Foundation are spearheading
replanting efforts. These efforts educate members of
the community on the importance of planting trees
and sustainable tree harvesting. They also provide
these community members with appropriate seedlings
and show them how to plant. Replanting promotes
developing microclimates and water-catchment areas.
Trees also protect farms from heavy winds.
Some farmers in Turkana County have begun insuring
their crops and livestock against climate hazards.
Initially, the government used to buy index-based
insurance for pastoralists in Turkana. Currently, the
Kenya Livestock Insurance Program is encouraging
more farmers to embrace voluntary insurance covers
that protect their farming activities (Turkana County
Government, 2018).
Research and development is also promising in Turkana
County (Opiyo et al., 2015). Turkana University, the
International Livestock Research Institute, and the
Kenya Forestry Research Institute are major players
in Turkana County’s research and development.
Researchers can also involve farmers in trials and
demonstrations. The Livestock Department among
other entities are also engaging in breeding research.
To deal with the locust scourge, it is imperative to
strengthen the surveillance capacity, have the necessary
equipment and staff for aerial and ground spraying of
chemicals to control and contain the locusts.

Adaptation strategies used in selected value chains in Turkana County
Extension services provision greatly
hampered - can only be given to
small-scale farmers living along
water sources; reduces tools and
equipment supplies; negatively
affects seed viability

processors; most transporters will
lose their jobs; high transportation
costs and increased market prices
Reduced produce for sale; market
price increases due to inadequate
supply; breaching of contract
between farmers and buyers; high
expenses due to importation
Concentration of extension services
in producing areas; late planting
Irrigation schemes and livestock
feeding

production of sorghum through
irrigation; improving/ promoting
irrigation methods; livelihoods
diversiﬁcation
Encouraging intensive farming
methods; enacting policies that
control this trade; government
and NGOs’ intervention through
importation; enhancing TV and
Radio use
Underlying Factors
Seeds viability affected when drought
persists leading to wastage(viability
loss); drought causes seed dormancy
during planting period especially
among the poor who do not have
storage facilities; tools’ supply
reduction; limited extension services.
Drought causes water scarcity thus
affecting production and may lead
to complete crop failure especially
among poor who can't afford to drill
boreholes; salts accumulation due
to high evapotranspiration; water
scarcity also affects sorghum
regeneration especially among
poor farmers who depend solely on
sorghum; wasted labor costs for
land preparation
Biophysical loss of ratooning ability
in sorghum which greatly affects
poor farmers; reduced production
especially among farmers in rural
areas; farmers far from water
sources more vulnerable
Low yields leading to low returns
especially for farmers living in rural
areas, the poor and middle-class
farmers
Difﬁcult for extension ofﬁcers to
reach farmers due to muddy roads;
destruction of available
infrastructure; low seed supplies
Poor land preparation; land
compaction; accelerated weed
growth; affects planting and weeding
as extra labor is required to ensure
proper growth; causes produce
rotting; poor quality and risk of
aﬂatoxin
Affects processing since it makes
produce drying difﬁcult and may
cause rotting; causes produce
wastage; affects produce and may
lead to losses during food or cereals
storage; hinders produce
transportation from the farm to
stores and markets which increases
post-harvest losses
Leads to price increases; causes
difﬁculty in transporting goods to
market; limited shelf-life; poor may
be unable to transport produce to
markets where they command good
prices
Heavy Rainfall
Consequences
Poor infrastructure in some areas

7. Synthesis and Outlook
The people of Turkana County secure their livelihood
from agriculture. However, this way of life in
challenged by inter-related issues that include climate
change, population growth, persistent droughts and
floods, and interpersonal conflicts. The area’s natural
resources are limited and often trigger conflict between
neighboring countries and counties. Turkana County
must address the issues of food security, safe water,
poverty, malnutrition, education, gender inequities,
and pollution in order to realize its environmental,
economic, social, and political potential.
Several value chains are important to Turkana County’s
vulnerable populations of the poor, youth, and woman
such as sheep and goats, local chicken, sorghum, and
fish. These value chains are more resilient to climate
change than others. However, limited rainfall and high
temperatures threaten these value chains. The county
government supports farmers by promoting water
harvesting, pasture development and conservation,
drought-resistant crops and livestock, irrigation, and
processing, and increasing market access.
Drought, intense rainfall, and flooding threaten
agriculture in Turkana County. Farmers need to adapt

Turkana County
appropriately to these threats. Many farmers do so by
cultivating drought-resistant crops, rearing drought-
resistant livestock, diversifying their farms, and
engaging in irrigation, soil and water conservation;
rainwater harvesting, and research and development.
Some of these adaptation strategies are expensive.
Financial and technical support, training, and
education from various institutions will help farmers
succeed. These institutions must prioritize the needs of
the poor and illiterate through the use of local TV and
radio stations, SMS, brochures translated into local
languages, meetings conducted in the local language,
and more.
Turkana County houses various institutions that help
farmers adapt to climate change. They provide advice,
information, and supplies for farmers. Most of these
institutions suffer from a lack of human and financial
capital. Therefore, proper resource allocation and
training will go a long way to ensuring their success.
The Turkana County Climate Change Bill 2020 is in
its final stages. This bill will allocate 2% of the county
budget towards climate change mitigation.
Poor policy limits farmers’ ability to respond to climate
change. For example, policies often contradict each
other, posing problems for those that try to adhere
to them. Policies are often ignored, due to a lack of
enforcement. Oftentimes, policies are confusing or
the county government is unable to enforce the policy.
Policy creators must involve all relevant stakeholders in
their work in order to ensure harmony, effectiveness,
and consistency.
Responding to climate change must become a priority
at the county level. This requires an appropriate political
framework that can effectively combine economic,
social, and environmental factors in a coherent,
complementary, and interlinked manner. The county’s
agriculture sector should aim to increase efficiency and
decrease fault. Climate-change analysis should include
analysis of markets, institutions, and the government.
Finally, the county government must ensure that the
farmers and residents of Turkana County are involved
in climate change management plans.

10. Annexes
10.1 Glossary
Climate change: refers to a change in the state of the climate
that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes
in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that
persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer.
Climate change may be due to natural internal processes
or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles,
volcanic eruptions, and persistent anthropogenic changes in
the composition of the atmosphere or in land use (IPCC, 2018).
Climate risk: The potential for consequences where
something of value is at stake and where the outcome is
uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values. Risk is often
represented as probability of occurrence of hazardous
events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these events or
trends occur. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability,
exposure, and hazard (IPCC, 2018).
Climate hazard: The potential occurrence of a natural or
human-induced physical event or trend or physical impact
that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as
well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods,
service provision, ecosystems, and environmental resources
(IPCC,2018).
Climate variability: Variations in the mean state and other
statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of
extremes, etc.) of the climate on all spatial and temporal scales
beyond that of individual weather events (IPCC, 2018).
Absolute poverty: a lack of basic human needs, mainly food,
shelter, clothing, water, education and health care.
Food Poverty: Not having the means to acquire enough
food to live a normal healthy life. When a population cannot
consistently afford the minimum amount of recommended
nutritional food, it suffers from food poverty.
The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): Four
greenhouse gas concentration (not emissions) trajectories
adopted by the IPCC for its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The
four RCPs, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5, are named
after a possible range of radiative forcing values in the year
2100 (of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 W/m2, respectively).
Green House Gases: Atmospheric gases responsible for
causing global warming and climate change. The major GHGs
are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4 ) and nitrous oxide
(N2 O). Less prevalent but very powerful greenhouse gases are
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and Su
