Zimbabwe views climate change as a direct threat to its socio-economic development with the potential of
reversing the hard earned developmental gains achieved since independence. According to observations
and scientific studies, climate change has resulted in an increase in the average temperature and high inter
and intra-seasonal rainfall variability and in extreme cases flooding and droughts for Zimbabwe. This has
largely affected water resources availability for agricultural purposes and inevitably reduced agriculture
production which supports over 70% of the country’s rural population for their livelihoods mainly through
rain-fed agricultural systems. The impacts of climate change on agriculture production have rendered a
significant proportion of households food and nutrition insecure and consequently having to rely on food
aid while climate projections show that conditions will worsen.
There is growing drive the world over to increase climate action through scaling up both climate change
mitigation and adaptation interventions. The Government of Zimbabwe in partnership with its stakeholders
have prioritised national actions that build climate resilience, lower the country’s greenhouse gas emissions
(GHGs), and contribute to sustainable development. In this regard, we have actively welcomed innovations
and programmes such as Climate-smart Agriculture (CSA). CSA practices are expected to sustainably
increase productivity and resilience (adaptation), reduce GHGs (mitigation), and enhance achievement
of national food security as well as sustainable development goals. CSA is widely expected to contribute
towards achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement to “hold” the temperature increase below 2°C and
enhance climate change adaptation.
CSA practices have since been identified in Zimbabwe’s National Climate Policy, National Climate Change
Response Strategy (NCCRS), Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), Zimbabwe Agriculture
Investment Plan (ZAIP) and the Draft Comprehensive Agriculture Policy as a priority intervention as the
country steps up efforts to tackle climate change. Furthermore, CSA training was identified as a sustainable
mode to enhance CSA adoption in the country hence the development of this Manual. As Ministries, we
are grateful that this timely Manual will be a robust resource material primarily for agriculture colleges in
Zimbabwe and extension officers working in various parts of the country. The graduates of the colleges of
agriculture will be better prepared to carry out farmer trainings and outreaches to promote new climate-
smart principles and practices.
The use of this manual is expected to transform the country’s agriculture sector into a sustainable
production system by maximising the climate opportunities and reducing climate change related risks on
the agriculture sector.
The Government of Zimbabwe would like to thank the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) for
the technical assistance to develop this manual, Green Impact Trust – the request proponent, UNEP-DTU
Partnership lead implementer of the technical assistance, VUNA for providing additional support towards
delivering the manual and all those who made it possible to have this manual produced.

Foreword by CTCN
In the past 30 years, Zimbabwe has seen the frequency and length of dry spells during its rainy season
increase, while the frequency of rainy days has declined. As the country relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture,
climate change poses a serious threat to food and livestock production. ‘Climate-smart agriculture’ represents
an approach to transforming and reorienting agricultural development in response to such climate change
pressures. Given that Zimbabwe’s agricultural colleges are considered centres of excellence in promoting
best practices in agriculture, the Zimbabwean Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate, together with the
Green Impact Trust, recognised the importance for these colleges to incorporate a new curriculum based on
transitioning to climate-smart technologies. They therefore requested the Climate Technology Centre and
Network’s technical assistance to mainstream climate-smart considerations and solutions into the agricultural
educational system in order to reinforce the country’s resilience to climate change among other benefits.
The Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN), the implementation arm of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Technology Mechanism, promotes the accelerated
transfer of technologies for energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient development. As nations around
the world seek to fulfil their development goals in an increasingly sustainable and environmentally sound
manner, the CTCN aims to serve as a trusted partner by providing expert policy and technology support. At the
request of nationally-selected representatives (National Designated Entities, or NDEs), the Centre harnesses
the expertise of its global network of over 350 finance, NGO, private sector, and research institutions, along
with CTCN hosts, UN Environment and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO),
to deliver tailored assistance and capacity building in a broad range of sectors including agriculture, energy,
transport, water and waste management.
In response to Zimbabwe’s request, the CTCN collaborated with Zimbabwean NDE, the UNEP-DTU
Partnership, and other key national counterparts including the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate;
the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development; and Zimbabwe’s universities and
agriculture colleges, to develop the Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Agriculture Education in Zimbabwe.
This manual will be complimented by a capacity building process, including training of trainers, which will
enable broader dissemination to agriculture students and extension workers across the country.  We are
deeply grateful to all of our partners for their work and for Zimbabwe’s tireless involvement and support in the
undertaking of this initiative.
My sincere hope is that this manual will contribute to the further integration of a climate-smart approach
in agricultural education and that future Zimbabwean extension workers, agriculture entrepreneurs and
smallholder farmers will be better equipped to increase productivity and incomes, build resilience to climate
change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions where possible, and ultimately, enhance the achievement of
Zimbabwe’s national food security and development goals.
Sincerely,
Jukka Uosukainen
Director, Climate Technology Centre and Network

Introduction
Introduction and background
In Zimbabwe, the frequency and length of dry spells during the rainy season have increased in recent
years—the consequences of which include increased heat and water stress on natural ecosystems,
agricultural crops and livestock, which ultimately affects agriculture communities that depend on agro-
based livelihoods negatively. In addition, Zimbabwe continues to use an agro-ecological map from 1960
which divides the country into five agro-ecological regions, in spite of the fact that some of these natural
regions may have changed over time. This poses a threat to agriculture, economic growth and development
as the climate continues to change.
On the other hand, Zimbabwe continues to depend on rain-fed agriculture, which poses a serious threat
to food and livestock production. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation
Development (MoAMID), in November 2015, at the launch of the National Climate Change Response
Strategy, the country had only about 200,000 hectares of crop production under irrigation against a
potential of five million hectares. Introduction and transition to climate-smart agricultural technologies in the
Zimbabwean agricultural education system is vital, as agricultural educational institutions are centres of
excellence, promoting best practices, especially to new smallholders. This would go a long way in helping
Zimbabwe in securing food and nutrition security. About 70 per cent of Zimbabweans reside in rural areas
where they rely on rain-fed agriculture for livelihoods. Unfortunately, the unreliable and intermittent rainfall
patterns have resulted in low agricultural output and productivity, and food and nutrition insecurity.
Cognisant of the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture, MoAMID organised a National
Curriculum Workshop on 25-26 July 2015 to review the courses offered in all government-run agricultural
colleges. The workshop acknowledged that there is an urgent need to mainstream education in Climate-
smart Agriculture (CSA) by offering national diplomas in all agricultural colleges, including Mazowe
Veterinary College.
It was evident that there is a pressing need to provide adequate and effective training on climate change
issues to agricultural extension workers so that they acquire expertise to impart CSA to rural farmers and
build resilience to climate change. In addition, it was felt that there is also a need to mobilise support to
ensure that this service provision is added into the mandate for extension workers.
Most farmers lack adequate knowledge of climate-smart agriculture and sustainable environmental
practices, which further increases their vulnerability, as well as the risks to agriculture and the environment.
Many smallholders continue to follow environmentally harmful practices, i.e., cutting down trees, slash and
burn, flood irrigation and forest degradation. There is also widespread use of and dependence on synthetic
fertilisers and harmful chemicals in crops and soils, which hinders the soil’s capacity to retain moisture and
nutrients.
The problems the country is facing in the agricultural sector mainly stem from climate change, unsustainable
farming methods and the lack of training for extension officers on enhancing productivity, climate change
adaptation and mitigation—i.e., climate-smart agriculture.  The current agricultural education syllabus does
not focus on climate-smart agriculture. With the country’s low adaptive capacity, there is an urgent need
to address agricultural education so as to develop sustainable solutions vis-à-vis food production, nutrition
security, and economic growth and development.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
In view of the above, the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate, as the National Designated Entity
(NDE) for the Climate Technology Centre Network (CTCN), requested CTCN for technical assistance
to develop a Climate-smart Agriculture Manual for Professional-Level and University-Level Agricultural
Education in Zimbabwe. This collaborative initiative involves MoAMID as the co-custodian of the CSA
Manual, the Green Impact Trust as the request proponent, and the UNEP-DTU Partnership as the lead
implementer. In addition to developing the CSA Manual, the project will also provide training to agriculture
(extension) workers in the form of Training-of-Trainers after the launch of the CSA Manual.
Projections for Zimbabwe’s climate
Climatologically, Zimbabwe has an extremely variable rainfall distribution, which will be exacerbated by
climate change. This will inevitably impact on agriculture and the availability of water to sustain human
activities. These future climate change impacts are likely to aggravate the harmful effects of poor land-
use practices, especially deforestation, soil degradation and water pollution. Communities that have been
made vulnerable by economic hardship and disease will find it even harder to cope. Several studies (IPCC,
2014a) on the impacts of climate change in southern Africa (Zimbabwe included) show that from 2050
until the end of the century the following phenomena are likely to be observed (Konrad Adenauer Stiftung,
2015):
••
A modest decrease in the total amount of rainfall (IPCC, 2014b) and changes in the onset and
cessation of rainy seasons
••
More frequent and prolonged mid-season droughts
••
Reduced groundwater recharge
••
Erratic spatial rainfall distribution across Zimbabwe
••
Temperature increase between 1°C and 3°C, which is greater than the global average increases
These climate changes are likely to result in:
••
Reduced water supply for domestic and agriculture uses
••
The expansion and contraction of Natural Regions V and I respectively (Mugabe et al., 2013)
••
Degradation of natural resources, especially soil, water, natural vegetation, crops and livestock
••
Reduced food security because of negative impacts on agriculture
Climate change impacts on agriculture
Zimbabwe’s agricultural activities are threatened by climate change impacts on rainfall, as discussed in
the previous section. Furthermore, poor land-use practices in the form of unsustainable soil and water
management, compromised biodiversity and unsuitable choice of crops are resulting in degradation of the
resource base within which agriculture is anchored. Climate change and variability will accelerate food
insecurity, which is gaining traction insidiously in Zimbabwe.
It is predicted that increasing temperatures will result in more frequent occurrences of heat stress and
increased infestations of pests and outbreaks of diseases, thus eroding the productivity of crops and
livestock, as well as increasing expenditure on pesticides, herbicides and veterinary drugs. In addition,
there are likely to be shifts of between four and six weeks in the onset and cessation of the rainy season
(Mugabe, 2013, Lesolle, 2012). This implies shifts in planting and harvesting dates, as well as changes to
the length of the growing season and to the types of crops and livestock that are suitable to these changes.
This will result in increased demands for irrigation and increased strain on groundwater resources to
support crops and livestock, especially in areas where water is climatologically scarce.

3
Livestock and wildlife will suffer equally from a lack of good pastures and vegetation due to erratic rainfall
and heat waves associated with high temperatures. The frequency of fires, both natural and anthropogenic,
is likely to increase due to a combination of dry vegetation and high temperatures.
Wheat, maize and horticultural growing areas will shift in tandem with changes to the agro-ecological zones
mentioned above. The IPCC predicts maize yield losses of between 18% and 30% in southern Africa by
2050 (IPCC, 2014a) and also mentions the possibility of sorghum yields declining. Areas suitable for maize
cultivation are projected to decrease by 2080. One study predicts that the south and west of Zimbabwe
will become less suitable for growing sorghum and maize, while the north, central and eastern areas will
support sorghum and cotton (Brown et al., 2012). Crops such as groundnuts, roundnuts and cassava could
benefit from enhanced CO2 levels (IPCC, 2014b), while areas suitable for sorghum and cotton cultivation
are likely to increase by 2080.
Need for climate-smart agriculture
Climate-smart Agriculture is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as agriculture that
sustainably increases productivity, enhances the resilience of livelihoods and ecosystems, reduces
and/or removes greenhouse gases (GHGs) and enhances the achievement of national food security
and development goals. The ravages of climate change and variability on agricultural production made
it imperative for the government to call for the introduction of CSA practices into the tertiary education
curriculum and agricultural extension advisory services—hence the need for the CSA Manual.
CSA includes proven practical techniques such as mulching, intercropping, conservation agriculture,
crop rotation, integrated crop-livestock management, agroforestry, improved grazing and improved water
management. It also involves the introduction of innovative practices such as more dependable weather
forecasting, early-warning systems and climate-risk insurance. The climate-smart agriculture concept
reflects the ambition of further integrating agricultural development and climate responsiveness. The
concept aims to achieve food security and broader development goals in circumstances of a changing
climate and increasing food demand. Increased planning is vital in order to address trade-offs and synergies
between the three pillars of productivity, adaptation and mitigation (Vermeulen et al., 2012). By addressing
challenges in the environmental, social and economic dimensions across productive landscapes, CSA
practices coordinate the priorities of multiple countries and stakeholders in order to achieve more efficient,
effective and equitable food systems. While the concept is new and still evolving, many of the practices that
make up CSA already exist worldwide and are currently used by farmers to cope with various production
risks. Mainstreaming CSA calls for critical analysis of successfully completed, on-going practices and their
relationship with current and future institutional and financial enablers.
The role of higher and tertiary education in CSA includes research and development, networking and
capacity-building. Capacity-building relates to both technical skills and knowledge diffusion. Tertiary
institutions in Zimbabwe also participate in the provision of training materials for various stakeholders.
CSA Manual approach and structure
Climate change impacts agriculture in different ways. The type of impact dictates the nature of the entry
point when introducing CSA interventions. The three CSA pillars (productivity, adaptation and mitigation)
can be handled at different levels—technological, organisational, institutional and political—hence the
need for ease of identification, for which it is prudent to classify the entry points under three thematic areas:
(a) enabling environments, (b) systems approaches, and (c) practices. Thereafter each entry point under
each thematic area is analysed in terms of productivity, mitigation and adaptation potential. The ensuing
chapters or entry points in this Manual follow this approach.
Introduction

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Planning and implementing CSA interventions entail grasping as well as identifying challenges and
opportunities, proposing plans and solutions, implementing, and ultimately monitoring and evaluating. For
example, in this regard, Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) CSA analyses projects in
four steps, viz. (Westermann, 2016):
i.
Situational analysis: understanding the status of CSA endeavours and the vulnerabilities of prevailing
contexts across several levels, i.e., environmental, administrative and political.
ii.
Targeting and prioritisation: this implies streamlining an extensive list of potential practices, policies
and services to a range of options that can attract financial support.
iii.	 Programme support: focusses on developing materials and plans for training and scaling up of
interventions.
iv.	 Monitoring and evaluation: involves monitoring and evaluation of CSA plans and the development
of tools and strategies to implement progress, evaluate impacts and enhance learning to improve
project implementations and outcomes.1
In line with the discussion above, the arrangement of the chapters in the CSA Manual is as follows:
Section I: Enabling environments
--
Institutional  arrangements and policy engagement
--
Climate information services
--
Weather index-based insurance
--
Gender and social inclusion
Section II: System approaches
--
Landscape management
Section III: Practices
--
Soil and water management
--
Crop production
--
Livestock and rangeland management
--
Sustainable forest management and agroforestry
--
Fisheries and aquaculture
--
Energy management
--
Climate-smart Agriculture in Zimbabwe—the way forward
Mandate of the CTCN
The UNFCCC’s CTCN assistance in the development of the Zimbabwe CSA Manual is consistent
with its mandate to promote accelerated, diversified and scaled-up transfers of environmentally sound
technologies for climate change mitigation and adaptation in developing countries, in accordance with their
sustainable development priorities. As defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
climate technologies cover any piece of equipment, technique, practical knowledge or skills for performing
a particular activity that can be used to confront climate change. The United Nations Environment
Programme-Technical University of Denmark Partnership [UNEP DTU Partnership (UDP)]—a member
of the CTCN Consortium—is taking the role of lead implementer for this technical assistance. In the case
of Zimbabwe, this assistance consists of technical expertise and recommendations related to specific
technology needs associated with the development of the CSA Manual.

Abstract
Climate change has intensified the challenges faced by rain-fed agricultural systems. As a result, there
is growing recognition of the need to harmonise protection of the environment, investment in smallholder
agriculture and improving food production and productivity, while reducing carbon emissions and
vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. Achieving sustainable food production calls for a paradigm
shift that allows institutional arrangements and the creation of synergies focused on championing the
components of Climate-smart Agriculture (CSA). While the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and
Irrigation Development (MoAMID) and the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate are the major players
in the promotion of climate action, there is often a disconnect between these sister institutions, coupled
with conflict between farmers and policymakers. A coordinated, legally binding institutional framework for
the enforcement of CSA interventions is required given the need for greater coordination and integration
among institutions. The instrument is designed to remove bottlenecks while ensuring concerted effort that
maximises established synergies while minimising trade-offs between institutions and actors. The CSA
policy should therefore be premised on a framework that is clear, scalable and inclusive, taking advantage
of the entry points that already exist in the CSA technologies and practices undertaken by a number of state
and non-state actors. These include the Department of Research and Specialists Services, the Agricultural
Research Council, International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), Scientific and Industrial
Research and Development Centre (SIRDC), Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
(CGIAR), Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) and other similar research institutions. These actors
have worked on a variety of CSA practices, such as drought-tolerant germplasm, the introduction of
drought-tolerant maize varieties and livestock production. The absence of a legal framework guiding CSA
operations has seen research institutions offering piecemeal training in the adoption of new technologies,
taking into account local innovations and strengthening knowledge sharing at the individual level. This
chapter highlights the CSA practices that can be used as entry points for the formulation of CSA policy and
the governance of institutional arrangements.
Key words: climate-smart agriculture, entry points, inclusive, institutional arrangements, policy
Key messages
By the end of this chapter, the reader should be able to:
i.
Identify key institutions that can champion CSA and its implementation using existing policy
instruments that recognise CSA as a technology for improving food security;
ii.
Identify all existing entry points for CSA implementation and establish the capacity needs to improve
the design and implementation of the programmes;
iii.	 Identify and list institutional arrangements that can be established in the implementation of CSA; and
iv.	 Recommend policy statements for input into the national CSA legal/policy framework.

1.1	 Introduction
There is growing recognition of the need to reconcile environmental protection with smallholder agriculture
by reducing carbon emissions, improving food production and productivity, and reducing vulnerability
to the predicted impacts of climate change—in other words, CSA (Meinzen-Dick, et al., 2012). While
advocating all these changes, policy and institutional arrangements need a paradigm shift to allow the
creation of synergies that focus on and champion the components of CSA without creating bottlenecks.
Zimbabwe has a number of policies and strategies relevant to climate change, some of which support
CSA. The National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS), and Zimbabwe’s Intended Nationally
Determined Contribution (INDC), pay particular attention to the inclusion of fully fledged CSA programmes
that are sustainable and also foster resilience among smallholders. In particular, the INDC highlights the
need for legislation to regulate CSA activities and promote the adoption of complementary technologies.
The Comprehensive Agriculture Policy Framework (2012-2032) recognises the use of climate-smart
technologies for sustainable food production in Zimbabwe. Other policy instruments in place, such as the
Food and Nutrition Security Policy, the Zimbabwe Agriculture Investment Plan, the National Environmental
Policy and Strategies (2009), the National Policy and Programme on Drought Mitigation, the Draft Disaster
Risk Management Policy and Strategy, the Technology and Innovation Policy (2012), the Southern African
Development Community (SADC),  the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and
the Food and Nutrition Frameworks, only recognise the existence of climate change without describing
how mainstreaming of the subject can be achieved. Lately, the National Climate Policy, which awaits
government approval, has been developed to support CSA activities as recommended in the INDCs.
These policies could be harmonised so as to give CSA its place and foster easy but fruitful collaboration
among state and non-state institutions.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development and the Ministry of Environment,
Water and Climate are the major players in the promotion of climate action, but there is often conflict
between farmers and policymakers, coupled with disconnection between sister institutions. CSA will
require significant coordination and integration in order to reach landscape levels (Meinzen-Dick, et al.,
2012; Williams et al., 2015). Sustainability, reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience call for major
shifts in the way these institutions and actors interact (Steinecker, 2012). Legislation focused on CSA
implementation is required to coordinate institutions and actors. Questions that should be addressed when
setting the tone for climate-smart policy development include the following (Box 1.1):
Box 1.1  Questions for climate-smart policy development
Using the Economics and Policy Innovations for Climate-Smart Agriculture (EPIC) projects in Malawi
and Zambia as examples: http://www.fao.org/climatechange/epic/projects/en/:
a.	 What policies supporting agriculture exist in Zimbabwe, and do they recognise climate change?
b.	 What entry points exist for Zimbabwe to support CSA through harmonised CSA policies?
c. What are the costs, benefits and barriers to the adoption of climate-smart practises by individual
institutions?
d.	 What are the major components of a scalable strategic framework for the development of a CSA
policy that recognises the strengths and differentiated ability levels of the different institutions
and their involvement in the success of CSA?
e.	 Major institutions and players for the successful implementation of CSA in Zimbabwe need to
be identified.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
1.2 	Mainstreaming CSA into national policies and programmes
CSA contributes to a wide range of developmental goals, especially for smallholders. It needs to be
implemented using a cross-cutting, cross-sectoral approach to agriculture and food security and other
aspects of sustainable development, poverty reduction and general development. CSA policies and
programmes, as with all cross-sectoral development programmes, should be aligned with all levels of
government. This calls for an understanding of the structure and functioning of each level of government.
Comprehensive capacity-building needs to be developed, since in many developing countries local-level
capacity development is not taken into account in decentralisation processes.
To create an enabling environment for the development and mainstreaming of CSA in the national
development plan, appropriate institutions with effective and transparent governance structures are
necessary. These institutions ought to coordinate the division of sectoral responsibilities and the
associated mandates of national local institutions that will incorporate CSA practices into legal and
regulatory frameworks. Regulations need to be adapted to country environments and accompanied by
other supporting incentives if CSA interventions are to be successful in influencing behaviour by providing
additional attractions in advocating CSA.
Civil society, the private sector and financial institutions play important roles in implementing CSA in
their respective ways. These entities should jointly make a concerted effort to work with key national line
ministries, development agencies and donors through an efficient stakeholder consultation process for the
advancement of CSA practices.
Often, training and programmes promoting technology are designed to intervene at community level or
sometimes with cooperatives. These require groups or individuals to cooperate with government programmes
or market agents. A detailed understanding of how institutions or actors operate and interact is vital in the
development of CSA policy development or the harmonisation of available policies in order to ensure that
CSA technology-oriented programmes are inclusive (IIED, 2012). Grouping institutions according to their
strength in CSA implementation and expertise allows strong synergies to be brokered using top-down,
bottom-up and horizontal participatory processes and models. Research and higher education institutions
will play a pivotal role in the development of CSA models, providing a balance among several institutions
that are key to CSA implementation. The models identify the kinds of synergies and collaborations that
could best bring out institutional strengths while compensating for institutional weaknesses in addressing
climate change through CSA. Cooperatives offer the potential for smallholders to join together to gain
bargaining power, but they often exclude certain actors through social biases such as gender and ethnicity
(Mwangi, Markelova, and Meinzen-Dick, 2012).
In order to strike partnerships and introduce equity that promote productivity, resilience and carbon
sequestration in CSA, no single sector or type of institution should be regarded as inclusive. Poorly
designed interventions may fail to reach the intended recipients and therefore not address the pillars of
CSA holistically. In creating synergies, inclusiveness should be an end in itself, rather than a means of
achieving some of the goals of CSA. Once affirmative commitment exists, the coherence, coordination and
integration of institutions in CSA should become the priority and focus of all institutions in order to avoid
pitfalls that cause disconnection in CSA implementation.
1.3 	Opportunities for mainstreaming CSA in policies and programmes
of Zimbabwe
Achieving the necessary levels of success for CSA will require a concerted effort to maximise any
synergies established and minimise trade-offs between institutions and actors. Therefore institutions and
incentives should be put in place to achieve climate-smart transitions. This could be illustrated by examples
from other developing countries. For example, in Nigeria, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural

11
Development has established the Advisory Committee on Agricultural Resilience in Nigeria (ACARN) to
support the country’s efforts in increasing the resilience of the agriculture sector. ACARN has developed a
comprehensive National Agricultural Resilience Framework, which supports short-and long-term efforts to
increase resilience, reduce vulnerability and improve food security.
Initiatives like those listed in Box 1.2 could be designed in such a way so as to include all interested institutions.
Given a legislative framework, each partner would have to work to maximum capacity for best results, while
also acknowledging shared ownership. In Box 1.2, the institutions are shown working towards improving
food and nutrition security using climate-smart technologies. Therefore a legally binding framework would
provide room for institutional reforms that can be adopted to promote the governance of CSA issues. As an
example, providing free of charge weather and climate data for CSA programmes whilst partners improve
observation networks provides a good cost and benefit situation for partners as well as communities.
Box 1.2  Role of institutions in improving food security using climate-smart practices
The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and Community Technology Development Organisation
(CTDO) worked together in some districts in Zimbabwe improving the livelihoods of communities
through the provision of seed and indigenous small livestock. CTDO was the implementing agency.
Livestock became a livelihood backup in the face of drought.
The Meteorological Services Department (MSD) worked together with Oxfam in the project
“Strengthening weather and climate information dissemination” in Masvingo and Matebeleland
provinces. MEWC is currently working with Oxfam, Plan International, Safire and the University of
Zimbabwe in the project “Scaling up Climate adaptation in Zimbabwe, with a focus on rural livelihoods”.
These projects could have run concurrently.
Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) has partnered with the Catholic Agency for Overseas
Development (CAFOD) and Environment Africa (EA) in implementing the Integrated Food, Nutrition
and Income Security Programme (FNI). In the project, households are able to increase and diversify
production of crops and small livestock through use of climate-smart technologies.
1.4 	Role of institutions in scaling up CSA
Policies and programmes are unlikely to be effective unless their implementation is supported by sound
institutions. It is therefore important to enhance institutional capacities in order to implement and replicate
CSA strategies. Institutions are vital to agricultural development as well as the realisation of resilient
livelihoods. They are not only a tool for farmers and decision-makers, but are also the main conduit through
which climate-smart agricultural practices can be scaled up and sustained (FAO, 2013).
The focus in this chapter is on institutions at three different levels, i.e., (i) building local institutional
frameworks, (ii) strengthening the key role of meso-level institutions, and (iii) enhancement of the national
institutional capacity to implement policy decisions. Other important formal institutions may include
regional or supranational institutions in different contexts. Non-traditional actors may also include market
and private-sector actors, such as insurance and agro-advisory companies, or other similar outfits.
1.4.1  Building local institutional frameworks
Support to climate change adaptation and mitigation among smallholders hardly works when it is imposed
from outside: local institutional frameworks for the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices at the
Institutional arrangements and policy engagement

12
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
district and community levels must play a facilitating role. This means that institutional frameworks that
support farmer-driven adoption and adaptation must be encouraged (Agrawal et al., 2009). Supporting
such frameworks usually not only involves developing new institutions but also creating synergies between
existing institutions to implement policies effectively.
1.4.2  Buttressing the role of meso-level institutions
Meso-level institutions, like local governments and local state agencies, are vital for energising national
institutions to support communities in climate change adaptation and mitigation. On the other hand,
they have limited access to funding, which is often monopolised by national-level institutions or stuck in
administrative bottlenecks (Christoplos et al., 2014). Therefore, a vital but often trivialised institutional entry
point is the strengthening of the mandate and access to funding of local governments and other institutions
at the meso-level.
1.4.3  Working to enhance national institutional frameworks
Efforts to support CSA are stymied by a lack of the appropriate institutions, institutional capacity and
coordination at the appropriate levels. As incentives, farmers need enabling conditions to make
transformations on the ground, which ought to be facilitated by institutions and policies. State institutions
are particularly important for the production and dissemination of information related to CSA strategies, i.e.,
technology options, climate variability and value chain conditions. In any case, national institutions take the
lead in providing safety nets and insurance schemes for farmers. Some options for enhancing institutional
efficiency include building human knowledge and capacities, strengthening institutional procedures,
integrating climate change and CSA into strategic plans and policies e.g., Nationally Appropriate Mitigation
Actions (NAMAs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Intended Nationally Determined Contributions
(INDCs), strengthening institutional and sector collaboration both horizontally and vertically, and analysing
options for deconcentration and decentralisation (Anyonge et al., 2013).
1.5	 Role of higher and tertiary education institutions and civil-society
organisations in promoting CSA
Climate has changed over the years without an equal change in agricultural systems. Several CSA
interventions have been proposed and implemented through a wide spectrum of models from the global to
local scales. However, the success of new technologies and training programmes hinges to a large extent
on the support offered by research and academic institutions, as well as on NGOs.
Several tools can be used to highlight the role of higher and tertiary institutions in promoting CSA. The tools
become a checklist against which an institution is measured for its potential in promoting CSA.
1.5.1  Crop suitability
The agricultural systems of smallholders in Zimbabwe have been modified by climate change (Gwenzi
and Mupuro, 2015). Multiple stressors have resulted in the loss of significant crop production (Gwimbi,
2009; Mapfumo et al., 2010). A business-as-usual approach among farmers in terms of crop production
cannot overcome the challenges of extreme weather and climate shocks. Universities and research
institutions working together with NGOs and extension staff and using participatory approaches have room
to experiment, study weather and climate patterns, analyse and advise locals of the most suitable crops
for an area using CSA practices. This leaves room for farmers to participate fully in the whole experimental
process until the results become available from which they are able to decide on the most suitable crops
for their area (Box 1.3). Such projects give smallholders ownership of the process and outcomes. Farmers
are given an equal opportunity to choose from among many crop varieties, both indigenous and hybrids.

13
Potential universities that can articulate the programme should promote both local partnerships and
private partnerships without prejudicing the smaller players. This can be accomplished in partnership with
development agencies and NGOs.
Box 1.3  Training of research institutions for crop suitability
Biodiversity International, in collaboration with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research (CGIAR), has launched a programme in which they train research institutions in determining
crop suitability. The materials have been developed jointly by the Walker Institute, University of
Reading, UK, and the Decision and Policy Analysis (DAPA) programme at International Center for
Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). Analogue tools that allow the researcher to identify, connect and map sites
with statistically similar climates across space and time in order to answer crop suitability questions
are used. The idea is to answer questions such as “Where in the world can I find a future (or present)
climate comparable to the future (or present) climate of my location of interest?” This can be used to
initiate the borrowing of similar concepts to develop locally specific adaptation and mitigation options
that are pro-poor but fulfil the major goals of CSA in agricultural policy and planning. In 2015, the
Community Technology Development Organisation (CTDO), together with the University of Zimbabwe,
had initial training in using the tools. The success of such a programme can be used to influence policy.
1.5.2 	 Coordinate reform and define new investment for maximum positive
impact
The success of CSA hinges on research institutions that are capable of efficiently coordinating research
that has positive impacts on sustainability, resilience and food security. Higher and tertiary educational
institutions should coordinate and drive the CSA vision and all its aspects in a strategic and scalable
manner. A good example that local universities can copy is the TEAM-Africa concept: the Tertiary Education
for Agriculture Mechanism for Africa. TEAM-Africa has established a network of African universities called
the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) and the African Network
for Agriculture, Agroforestry and Natural Resources Education (ANAFE). Among its key mandates is to
engage in an analytical exercise that projects the rapidly changing locus of labour demand in Africa’s food
and agricultural systems.  Similar ideas can be downscaled to country and local scale to promote good
governance, policy formulation and skills in CSA.
1.5.3 	 Knowledge-sharing and networking
Universities, research institutions, extension workers and NGOs are in a good position to bring different
stakeholders together, such as farmer communities, corporate organisations and government, including
its agencies. Knowledge sharing and network platforms can take the form of master farmer and farmer
field schools. These have been used mostly by extension staff to train farmers in agronomic practices. In
recent years, the emergence of Climate Field Schools (CFS) (Stigter and Ofori, 2014) has boosted farmers’
responses to climate change, for example, in Indonesia. CFS are schools without walls where farmers,
researchers and extension staff meet, share experiences, identify problems, experiment, analyse and
discuss the outcomes. The farmers learn by doing. Having a training component, the CFS trainer allows
the cascading of information, knowledge and technology to grassroots levels, as training at these levels
is carried out by lead farmers who have become role models for others. In Uzumba-Maramba-Pfungwe
(UMP), to the northeast of Zimbabwe, farmers are now able to analyse locally measured data, giving them
better understanding of local weather patterns. As a result, they now plan farm activities, including CSA
practices, using local data. CSA policy formulation should consider CFS as an important tool for information
dissemination, together with social gatherings and Roving Seminars. Most knowledge sharing initiatives
Institutional arrangements and policy engagement

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
tend to provide farmers with overly technical information that is not easily understandable. The standalone
CSA, while borrowing from several other policies in existence, should specifically support simplification of
language and translation to community languages through the support of institutions of higher learning.
The legislation should improve village governance and by-laws promoting CSA through prioritisation of the
practice within the broader adaptation and mitigation programmes that already exist in an area. CSA policy
harmonisation or development should be allowed to reach out to existing infrastructure which is easily
accessible to smallholder famers.
1.5.4  Monitoring, advocacy and policy support
Extension staff need to actively monitor the impacts of climate change on agriculture, and progress in the
implementation of CSA in close collaboration with scientists and farmers. Where governance structures are
decentralised, extension officers play an important advocacy role to ensure that climate change remains high
on every agenda and that funds are allocated to CSA programmes. They also have a role in explaining CSA
practices to smallholders. The extension officers should be seen as the nodal points bringing together and
facilitating multiple stakeholders to discuss and address complex CSA problems and situations. In light of the
above, CSA advisory systems encompassing the institutions and actors involved in the provision of extension
and closely related services should be set up to govern the operation of the system at the grassroots level.
1.6 	Application of CSA in Zimbabwe
1.6.1  Seed production
The Department of Research and Specialist Services of Zimbabwe has fully supported CSA activities
and collaborated with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) by providing
oversight of drought-tolerant germplasm and seed production. Working together with the Crop Breeding
Institute (CBI), the department has offered training to crop-breeding specialists and farmers. Through their
work, drought-tolerant Open Pollinated Varieties (OPV) such as ZM309, ZM401 and ZM521 and hybrids
such as ZS263 and ZS265 have been launched in the market. The seeds are distributed by the Champion,
ARDA and Agriseeds companies.
1.6.2  Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa (DTMA)
In the last five years, CIMMYT and the CGIAR’s Research Programme on Maize have bred and tested
heat-tolerant varieties of maize suited to the local environment. In the 2015/16 season, CIMMYT conducted
on-farm variety trials of heat-tolerant maize in Zaka and Chiredzi Districts, Masvingo, where farmers were
able to harvest where all other varieties had failed. These varieties are expected to improve the country’s
food security. Smallholder Marutsvaka, who participated in the on-farm variety trials, says: “In the past, I
harvested nothing, as my crops were literally burnt by the scorching heat. During the 2015-2016 growing
season, I realised almost 200 kilograms of white grain.”
Seed varieties which have been successfully tested and released on the market through seed houses
include ZM309, ZM401, PAN3M-41 and SC301. These are distributed by Seedco and Pannar. Syngenta
has also launched a drought-tolerant maize variety, MRI514. SIRDC also launched Sirdamaize 113, suitable
for areas of marginal rainfall. Used in combination with good agricultural practices, they have performed
better than other hybrid seeds. The Seed Services Institute has tried and tested high-yielding sorghum
varieties (DC 75, and NS 511). Also being promoted are pearl millet varieties (PMV 3 and Okoshana),
which are early maturing varieties, requiring only 75 days to mature.
1.6.3  Conservation agriculture

15
To date CSA has been promoted using methods such as Conservation Agriculture (CA). The FAO and other
development partners supported more than 20,000 households in over 15,000 districts to implement CA
between 2005 and 2010 (Marongwe et al., 2011). Yields were observed to increase progressively over the
years, and the physical structure of the soil also improved. Since then there has been increased adoption
of CA due to the benefits. Being labour-intensive, the method is not suitable for the elderly. Entry points for
a fully-fledged CSA programme in Zimbabwe already exist from the work already done. Indigenous farming
methods similar to CA technologies should be identified and used as entry points in CSA policy formulation.
The active involvement of government systems in both research and extension will ensure sustainability.
The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has a number of CSA
projects which promote CA in order to capitalise on soil moisture enhancement complemented by micro-
dosing. Capacity-building of extension professionals in the approaches that can be used to implement CSA
at the grassroots level can easily follow from CA training, though they need broadening to include a wide
range of CSA concepts . There is a need to address the differences arising from different agro-ecological
zones so that solutions are not prescriptive but rather flexible.
1.6.4  Capacity-building
Farmer Field Schools exist in a number of districts, some of which have been converted to CFS. This is
another entry point which properly crafted policies should promote. CTDO, together with the Agromet Group
(University of Zimbabwe), have collaborated in four districts (UMP, Goromonzi, Chiredzi and Tsholotsho)
using the concept of CFS. Extension officers were trained in weather and climate issues, as well as the
use of weather data, in response to farming and developing the agrometeorological advisories needed
by smallholder farmers. In the project “Strengthening Weather and Climate Information Dissemination”,
the Meteorological Services Department (MSD) trained Agricultural Technical and Extension Services
(AGRITEX) officers in the interpretation of weather and climate information for better dissemination to
grassroots levels.
1.7 	Recommendations
Previous CSA-aligned projects and programmes had flaws which could be corrected in a new CSA era. The
lack of a water-tight system and standards to govern the implementation of programmes can result in the
exclusion of some institutions and participants. Sustainable CSA interventions require a standalone CSA
legal framework and policy that is inclusive. Such a policy can be developed through the harmonisation of
existing entry points and recognition of the following:
••
The practices and benefits in existing policies scattered around different ministries;
••
The levels of awareness required to bring CSA issues to the forefront;
••
Identifying all institutions (large and small) which have the capacity to champion CSA and cluster
them according to function, highlighting potential synergies;
••
Identifying key agricultural technologies and production systems across all sub-sectors that would
be showcased as climate-smart; and
••
Promote good CSA governance that allows enforcement of climate-smart agriculture interventions.
1.8 	Conclusions
Successful CSA adoption will require a legal instrument (policy) that promotes it and offers a clear, scalable,
inclusive, and standalone framework for CSA implementation. The instrument should clearly identify key
institutions, supporting actors and possible synergies, highlighting the costs and benefits of implementation.
Any policy formulation or improvement should consider existing programmes and plans and the coherence
and integration between agricultural development and processes that achieve sustainable food security.

Policy instruments for CSA should be inclusive and support growth, as well as providing a framework for
access to markets and knowledge sharing, locally and globally.

2.	 Climate information services
Abstract
This chapter addresses the issue of Climate Information Services (CIS) in light of the emerging body of
knowledge and evidence on climate change, agriculture and food security. Climate information services
encompass the entire process of procuring climate data for storage, and processing it into specific end-
products for use by different clients within climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture and health.
Climate information services contribute to CSA by ensuring the sustainable production of food and
income generation, thus enhancing adaptation, increasing resilience to climate change, and developing
opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases. An understanding of climate information services and the
contribution of the various actors in the value chain is of importance for students in tertiary institutions
and practising extension agents. The key concepts in CIS, agro-meteorological tools and extension
methods, supported by a set of interactive activities and case studies are presented in this chapter. The
chapter concludes by giving policy and institutional recommendations for the provision of effective climate
information services in Zimbabwe.
Key words: agro-meteorology, climate information services, climate-smart agriculture, extension, tertiary
education

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
2.1 	 Introduction
Climate Information Services, which involve the generation and dissemination of climate information and
its relevance to CSA, are discussed in this chapter. Climate change is one of the contributing factors to low
productivity in the agricultural sector. Increases in temperature, rainfall variation, and the frequency and
intensity of extreme weather events are adding pressure to global agricultural systems, (OECD, 2015).
Zimbabwe is no exception to these global experiences, being particularly vulnerable, as it depends heavily
on rain-fed agriculture. Notable changes include shifts in the onset of rains and increases in the frequency
and intensity of heavy rainfall events, the proportion of low rainfall years, high-intensity rainfall events and
the frequency and intensity of mid-season dry spells (Brown et al., 2012). Climate variability also threatens
natural processes that sustain fodder for livestock and moisture for crops and also promote sustainable
development in general.
According to FAO (2013), sustainable agriculture can be achieved through CSA. Provision of climate
information services is one of the requirements needed to achieve CSA objectives. Climate information
services are being addressed to enable vulnerable communities to reduce the risks associated with
climate, particularly extreme events, which are now increasing in frequency (WMO, 2011), as well as
allowing different sections of the economy to make informed decisions. Of particular interest, this chapter
helps students in tertiary education and practising extension agents to improve their understanding of the
importance of climate information services to CSA in order to communicate climate information effectively.
Finally, the chapter focuses on the guiding concepts of climate services and the contribution of climate
services to CSA, agro-meteorology and agriculture extension in Zimbabwe.
2.2	 Guiding concepts under the theme of Climate Information Services
2.2.1  Climate Information Services
Climate information services cover the whole process of obtaining climate data, storing it, and processing
it into specific products that are required by different users in climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture,
disaster-risk reduction and health, among others. In short, it is the packaging and dissemination of climate
information to specific users. According to WMO, 2011, climate services encompass a range of activities
that deal with generating and providing information based on past, present and future climate, and on its
impacts on natural and human systems. A climate information service is one of the five components of the
Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) (Figure 2.1). The major goal of GFCS is to enable better
management of the risks of climate variability and change at all levels through the development of science-
based climate information and prediction services and their incorporation into planning, policy and practice
(WMO, 2011).
As a component of the GFCS, Climate Services Information Systems (CSIS) has a role in producing and
distributing climate data and information according to the needs of users and agreed standards. The CSIS
is the principal mechanism through which information about climate (past, present and future) is routinely
collected, stored and processed to generate products and services that inform decision-making processes
across a wide range of climate-sensitive activities and enterprises. It is the means by which research
outputs and technological developments are transformed into improved operational climate information
(http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/wcasp/documents/workshop/pune2015PPT/day1/Session1-Global-
Framework-for-Climate-Services-GFCS.pdf).

2.2.2  Climate Outlook Fora
There are several regional centres that provide climate services across the world. Climate Outlook Fora
provide a platform for the dissemination of climate information at various levels to address the different
needs of communities (WMO, 2011). Users may obtain information from a range of global, regional and
national sources, as indicated in Table 2.1.
In the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), the SADC Climate Services Centre (CSC),
formerly the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Drought Monitoring Centre, has the responsibility
for the provision of climate services to member states. One of its activities is to coordinate the Southern
Africa Regional Climate Outlook Forum (SARCOF). SARCOF builds into the National Climate Outlook
Forum (NACOF) at the country level. This enables the generation of consensus over regional climate
seasonal forecasts.

2.2.3  Climate information generation system
The process of generating climate information globally is rather complicated, as indicated in Figure 2.2.

Activity 1. Can you compile a simple diagram from your understanding of climate generation for Zimbabwe?
One of the identified problems in figure 2.2 is that end users are at the receiving end. Explain why this is a
problem? What are other regional climate outlooks on the African continent?
2.2.4  Climate-smart agriculture
CSA was defined earlier in the scene-setting chapter. CSA addresses climate change by systematically
integrating climate information into the planning of sustainable agricultural systems (FAO, 2013). The major
aim of this integration is to ensure sustainable livelihoods in the face of climate change (see https://csa.
guide/csa/what-is-climate-smart-agriculture). CSA is knowledge-intensive and therefore requires access to
information to enable stakeholders and farmers to make informed decisions. Under CSA, systems that are
based on seasonal rainfall need to adapt and build resilience to climate change. It is within this context that
this chapter discusses the relevance of climate information systems.
2.2.5  Extension
Agricultural extension is a form of a rural advisory service that can be implemented by any organisation
in the public or private sector to provide information and advice to farmers and rural actors (Salas et al.,
2014). In brief, extension is defined as a series of embedded communicative interventions. This definition
is adopted here as it includes various actors in the value chain of climate information, from generators to
users of information.

2.3  Contribution of climate services to CSA
This section discusses the contribution of climate information services and extension to CSA.
2.3.1  Contribution of climate information services
CARE (2014) highlights the following contribution that climate information makes to CSA:
••
Productivity. Effective climate services are part of the enabling environment for the transition to
CSA. Adequate and timely weather information can help farmers make decisions on the timing of
agricultural activities and the variety of crops to be planted, thus increasing productivity. Climate
information provides a basis for flexible planning adapted to a range of climate possibilities. It
supports decision-making on which options to invest in, and when and how much to invest. For
example, a farmer may decide to grow a high-yielding maize variety, given a forecast of a good
season for rainfall. The farmer may decide to diversify and add the value of the harvested maize to
other projects such as poultry and piggery in order to increase income. According to a presentation
(AGRITEX, 2013), farmers need the following type of data (Box 2.1) in order to make informed
decisions.
Box 2.1  Farmer’s needs (Source: AGRITEX, 2013)
--
The expected start and end of rainfall patterns, as well as distribution. Simplified
forecasting can help farmers understand better the concepts ‘normal’, ‘below normal’
and ‘above normal’.
--
Probability of extreme events, dry and wet spells. This information should be made
available at the beginning of the season.
--
Probability of having certain quality of season, which can be calculated using historic
data.
--
Future weather patterns and their implications.
--
Risks in producing different crops (for informed decision-making), planting dates and
choice of crops and varieties.
--
Basketful of livelihoods options.
••
Adaptation through risk management. The effective use of climate information services contributes
to resilience by enabling farmers to manage the negative impacts of weather-related risks in poor
seasons better, while also taking greater advantage of average and better than average seasons. A
climate information system is the key to understanding climate as a major influence on livelihoods,
life, ecosystems and development. It allows effective adaptation, which involves developing a
range of adaptation options with the flexibility to switch from one strategy to another or to combine
strategies. It helps actors to adjust their plans as climate stressors and shocks unfold.
••
Mitigation. Climate information services can contribute to CSA by providing information that
supports the more efficient use of fertilisers so as to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere.
••
Contribution of agricultural extension to CSA. Agricultural extension plays a key role in CSA
mainly because adaptation to climate change requires changes in knowledge, attitudes, resilience,
capacities, people’s skills and extension systems. Agricultural extension contributes directly or
indirectly to the three pillars of CSA. According to Singh and Grover (2013), agricultural extension

23
roles include: technologies and management information; capacity development; facilitating brokering
and implementing policies and programmes; coordination; infrastructure/institutions; training; use of
technology demonstrations; yield crop forecasting; and feedback role. However, there are known
challenges in respect of the dissemination and uptake of various CSA technologies. These include
financial and operational resources; low ratios of extension officials to farmers; clientele socio-
cognitive factors, and institutional arrangements that are not responsive to climate change.
The challenges are amplified by the current extension services, which are staffed mostly by natural
scientists, including agronomists and engineers. These scientists have limited resources to support
farmers and also have limited skills in communicating climate information or addressing social challenges.
According to Salas et al., 2014, although a strong interdisciplinary vision is required, it is not readily
available in traditional extension systems. Moreover, there is a lack of adequate capacity at different levels
with which to carry out the actions and changes needed to diversify in the interests of stakeholders. Other
challenges include the lack of an enabling environment, including policies and the technical and financial
conditions to increase productivity and resilience. The lack of capacity to adapt and to seek opportunities to
mitigate emissions from greenhouse gases has also been reported. Lastly, the relevant information that is
available is confined to the scientific literature, little being done in terms of operational activities to reduce
greenhouse gases, for example.
2.4	 Practice: application of the theme in the Zimbabwean context
Understanding approaches and appreciating tools for communicating climate information and advisory
services is important in the adoption of CSA practices.
2.4.1  Agrometeorological tools for CSA
2.4.1.1  Climate and weather
According to WMO (2011), weather is the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place with respect
to variables such as temperature, moisture, wind, and barometric pressure. Climate refers to average
weather in terms of the mean and its variability over a certain time-span and a certain area. Climate change
is a change in the climate that persists for an extended period of time (WMO, 2011). Whereas climate
variability is any deviation in the long-term statistics of climate elements over a short period of time, which
can be a day, intra-seasonal, inter-seasonal or related to differences in climate from decade to decade.
The Zimbabwe Meteorological Services Department is responsible for the provision of a range of weather
and climate information for farmers (real-time weather data and short-, medium- and long-range forecasts),
that provide the basis for tactical and strategic adaptation at different levels of operational detail. When
and if properly tailored to farmers’ needs and expectations, these products are extremely valuable in the
implementation of CSA. The products in most cases have to be used concurrently to ensure that users
maximise the benefits. Climate forecasts are useful in giving an indication of what the climate may look like
in the near future, whilst projections are for the long term, (Salas et al., 2014), as discussed below.
2.4.1.2  Seasonal forecasts
The seasonal forecast, also referred to as the long-range (climate) forecast, is important as it assists
strategic planning by users in climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water and disaster risk
reduction. Seasonal forecasts provide the expected rainfall performance for the season in terms of the total
of accumulated amounts for sub-seasons. The sub-seasons for the three homogeneous rainfall regions
that Zimbabwe has been divided into are OND (October, November, and December) and JFM (January,
February and March) (Figure 2.3). The forecast is probabilistic in form and gives the outcomes for three
scenarios: above normal, normal and below normal.

N–normal; B–below normal)
Source: Meteorological Services Department, 2016
2.4.1.3  Medium-range weather forecasts
These forecasts are useful in giving the weather conditions expected for the next seven to ten days
(Box 2.2). The forecast will assist in carrying out various agricultural activities such as planting, fertiliser
application, weeding, spraying and mulching, i.e., tactical decisions. The forecast also helps farmers cope
with increasing rainfall variability by adjusting decisions on the timing of planting at short notice.
2.4.1.4  Short-range weather forecasts
These forecasts are issued to cover one to three days. This assists in decisions which may be immediate
such as chemical spraying, fertiliser application and frost protection. Delays in responses may limit the
effectiveness of the operation, particularly if certain weather conditions are expected in the next few hours.
Activity 2.  What advice would you give to a farmer under the following scenarios?
1.	 The three-day forecast indicates strong winds and morning rain/showers, and the farmer wants to
spray.
2.	 The 10-day forecast indicates heavy rains from 2–10 February, and the farmer would like to apply
top-dressing fertiliser.
3.	 In a certain ward in Chiredzi, a farmer wants to plant maize seed in February, since the area
experienced a late start to the season.
4.	 Discuss the importance of short-term, medium-term and long-term forecasts in agriculture.

Box 2.2 Use of SMS platform in disseminating weather forecasts in semi-arid regions of
Zimbabwe
This is a project implemented by Oxfam, MSD and AGRITEX on climate change adaptation in
Zimbabwe from 2012 to 2015, aimed at strengthening the dissemination of weather and climate
information amongst extension staff and farmers. In summer, 10-day weather forecasts and in winter
three-day weather forecasts were received through Short Message Systems (SMS) facilitated through
private and public partnerships. This project helped enhance the farmers’ ability to interpret weather
data and make informed decisions not only in agriculture but also in respect of disaster risk reduction
in livelihoods (Mubaya et al., 2016).
Activity 3.  Identify and discuss other projects on climate information services initiated in Zimbabwe.
2.4.1.5 Probability of extreme events
An extreme weather or climate event is one that shows a deviation from the norm. For example, an
increase in the number of rainy days where the total amount received in 24 hours exceeds 50 millimetres.
Due to climate variability and change, there is an observed increase in the severity and frequency of
extreme events (WMO, 2011; Mubaya et al., 2016). Figure 2.4 shows an upsurge of extreme events and
the severity and frequency of heavy rainfall in excess of 24 mm recorded at Chivhu in Zimbabwe.

1962–2010
Source: MSD, Zimbabwe, 2015
2.4.1.6  Inter- and intra-seasonal variability
Rainfall performance varies between seasons (inter-seasonal variability), as well as within a season (intra-
seasonal variability), as shown in Figure 2.5. Inter-seasonal variability is usually observed through several
factors such as seasonal totals, onset, cessation, and season length. These differences in the seasons are
sometimes linked to the status of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which has three phases: El Niño,
La Niña and neutral. However, it should be stressed that the ENSO is just one of the factors that affects
rainfall performance across seasons. Other factors include sea surface temperatures, teleconnections,

prevailing winds during the winter season, and prior heating from September to November and the Indian
Ocean Dipole.

Source: MSD, 2015
2.4.1.7  Start, end, and length of growing season
As an institution, AGRITEX adopts the following definitions of the start and end of the season, which are
dependent on soil type. The start of the season is “any day after the 10th of November when an area
receives 20 mm or more of rains in 3 days or less provided there is no dry spell of 10 days or more in the
next 20 days”. The end of the season is“ any last day before end of April when an area receives 15 mm of
rain provided there are no rains of 2.95 mm or above in the next 20 days” (AGRITEX, 2013). The length
of the rainfall season can be calculated by subtracting the date of the start of season from date of the end
of season. The length of the growing season goes beyond the length of the rainfall season, as it takes into
consideration the soil/water balance, which at this time of the season should be at zero, provided there
are no effective rains within the last 20 days. Season length is important in crop variety selection in CSA.
Inter-seasonal variability is shown in onset of rains for two seasons 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 (Figure 2.6).
Figure 2.6  Comparison of mean onset of rainy season (2013/14) with 2014/2015 season
Source: MSD, 2015

27
2.4.1.8  Dry and wet spells
A dry spell is a period of days with little or no precipitation and is therefore a collection of dry days, where
each day will have received less than 2.95 mm or 5 mm, depending on the threshold adopted for record-
keeping and analysis. Alternatively a dry spell is also defined as a period when the weather has been
dry for an abnormally long time, though shorter than and not as severe as a drought. The lengths of the
dry spells have significant consequences, particularly at critical growth stages such as the reproductive
stage (silking, ear formation, cob development). Such information will assist the farmers to make informed
decisions in CSA practices. In contrast, a wet spell is when 100 mm is received in five days. Figure 2.7
shows the probability of the occurrence of dry spells in Gutu, Zimbabwe. There is an increased chance of
the occurrence of 7–14 day dry spells within 30 days from any day in the growing season for Gutu (Mubaya
et al., 2016).
Figure 2.7  Probability of 7-day, 10-day and 14-day dry spell occurrence in Gutu for the
period 1987-2012
Source: MSD, Zimbabwe, 2015
2.4.1.9  Drought
Drought is defined as a period in which a region has a deficit in its water supply. The definition of drought is
region-specific and can be categorised into three main types: meteorological, hydrological and agricultural.
Socio-economic droughts have been reported in some cases. The different types of droughts cause social,
economic and environmental impacts as indicated in Figure 2.8. Meteorological droughts take into account
deficiencies in measured precipitation. CIS provides information on annually measured precipitation and
compares it to what is determined as normal and gives precautionary advice to farmers. For hydrologists,
droughts are monitored by checking stream flow and lake, reservoir, and aquifer water levels, which is
important in recommending appropriate soil and water management techniques in CSA. Agricultural
droughts occur as a result of water deficits that impact negatively on crop production.

2.4.1.10  Traditional indicators
Use of traditional indicators of climate and weather is common in most areas of Zimbabwe. Indicators used
include the observation of animals, insects, wind direction and tree phenology to indicate both good and
bad seasons. The indicators may not have a direct influence on CSA, but it is necessary to acknowledge
indigenous knowledge systems in weather and climate forecasts.
Activity 4. Discuss the indigenous indicators used in forecasting weather and climate in your area.
2.5  Agriculture extension for CSA
Several extension approaches are cited in the literature; the major categories including the group extension
approach, the mass media extension approach and the individual/household extension approach.
Extension approaches and methods have their advantages and disadvantages, meaning that there is no
best approach to extension (Speranza, 2010). The choice of a particular extension approach is determined
by the target audience, the available resources and the capacity of the facilitator, amongst other factors.
For the purposes of the discussion, extension approaches and methods are grouped into two sections:

29
traditional methods, and innovative approaches for climate-smart agriculture. Traditional extension methods
within the mass media approach include use of radio, print media such as newspaper and pamphlets, and
audio visual aids. In the group extension approach, there are demonstrations of agricultural practices, field
days, farmer days, master farmer training, training workshops and meetings, study circles, exchange visits
and farmer field schools. The individual extension approach involves house visits or individual farm visits.
2.5.1  Innovative extension approaches and methods
Innovative approaches should be centred on clear statements of the limits and limitations of alternatives,
rewards to communities for their knowledge inputs and building capacities to assess related parameters,
and the integration of agriculture and socio-economic development (http://www.fao.org/3/a-bl361e.pdf).
Salas et al., 2014 discussed a number of new initiatives in extension that respond to the challenges
of climate change, including science field shops, building climate-smart farmers, data-driven agriculture,
plant clinics and plant heath approaches, a citizen science approach, sustainable crop intensification,
participatory video, farmer to farmer extension, participatory scenario planning, index-based scenario
approaches and climate field schools, amongst others. WMO, 2014 cites other innovative approaches,
including Livelihoods, Early Assessment and Protection (LEAP) for early warning, and roving seminars for
communicating climate information.
Activity 5. Discuss the relevance of innovative extension approaches for climate-smart agriculture in any
communal area of your choice.
2.5.2  Information communication technology
Information Communication Technologies (ICT) are effective delivery mechanisms and knowledge sharing
methods that can improve access to information and awareness about CSA practices (Westermann,
Thornton and Forch, 2015). ICT provides information on meteorological data, advisory services, early
warning systems for disaster prevention and control, market prices and agricultural statistical data
gathering. ICT technologies include radio, TV, telephones, computers, mobile phones, internet and social
media. Farmers also play an active role in the dissemination of Climate Information (CI) within their
communities through ICT. In every rural household there is at least one mobile phone, which is often used
by many people. When farmers and extension agents receive climate information, they relay it to other
farmers by SMS (Speranza, 2010). This creates a multi-branching distribution chain. Instant information is
usually disseminated through this channel (Salas, 2014). Through their networks of social relationships,
they facilitate access to climate information for other farmers (see case study in Box 2.3 illustrating the
institutional benefits of ICT in Senegal). The same case study reports that use of ICT is constrained in
extension due to the high costs of investment, the lack of competition and the lack of relevant skills for
effectively using ICT.

Box 2.3  Case study of ICT
Findings from a project implemented by ICRISAT in Senegal, in collaboration with the national
meteorological agency and a number of local stakeholders, including farmers, indicated the benefits
of ICT at different levels:
--
Within the context of more frequent and extreme weather events and climate shocks,
enhanced early-warning systems provide a key opportunity to curb the erosion of progress.
--
It allowed farmers to base farm management decision-making on tailored and salient climate
information throughout the cropping cycle.
--
It helped farmers reduce climate risks and avoid regular food insecurity.
--
Downscaled seasonal rainfall and long-term weather forecasts reached around seven million
people in Senegal, helping smallholders to make better-informed decisions about agricultural
management in a changing climate.
--
The services allowed farmers to improve their adaptive capacity and increase farm productivity.
In addition, institutional behavioural change was observed in the Senegalese Ministry of Agriculture,
which considered climate information services as an input to their annual agriculture action plan
(Westermann, Thorton and Forch, 2015).
2.5.3  Data-driven agriculture
This is an approach in which technical decisions made on farms or recommended by extensionists are
supported by the analysis of large amounts of observational data (Salas et al., 2014). Farmers’ data
describing the management of crops, yields and crop status are pooled and combined with weather
records and soils data at field level to finely determine the actual conditions in which the crop grew and
the production it achieved. The idea takes advantage of every bit of data generated on farms, climate
stations and research and plant breeding plots, which are analysed to guide farmers in making decisions.
The information generated can be used by different stakeholders. The main risk with this data-driven
approach is the misuse of farmers’ data, as it needs to be compiled at some point. Data privacy and
farmers’ willingness to share their data can also be a challenge. Data-driven agriculture can take time to
reach the critical amounts of data that allow analysis.
In Zimbabwe, data-driven approaches are employed every season through surveys undertaken by the
government, such as the First and Second Round Crop and Livestock Surveys. For CSA practices, crop
and livestock data should be supported by weather-related data that includes rainfall, wind speed and
direction, temperature and evaporation rates to enable farmers to make informed decisions.
2.6  Role of higher and tertiary institutions in climate-smart practices
The role of higher and tertiary education in climate information services includes research and development,
networking, capacity-building and the facilitation of extension methods such as learning platforms and
support to communities. Capacity-building relates to both technical skills and knowledge in respect of
climate-smart agriculture and related subjects. Tertiary institutions in Zimbabwe participate in research
and the provision of training materials for various stakeholders. Tertiary educational institutions provide
the necessary environment for learning and knowledge exchange and also support community initiatives
(Hiepe and Kals, 2010).

31
2.7  Policy implications
Policies provide an enabling environment to ensure that stakeholders provide climate services, reconcile
differences and create the necessary institutional infrastructure to work together (FAO, 2013). At the national
level, climate change policies are expressed through national and regional strategies and plans, including
National Adaptation Plans, Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions and Intended Nationally Determined
Contributions (INDCs). Policies facilitate the promotion of incentives and programmes of climate services
that enhance the adoption of CSA, such as research and extension, reduction of tariffs on ICT and public/
private partnerships to ensure effective communication of climate information.
2.8  Conclusion and recommendations
Sources of climate information are many. It is therefore imperative to have well-coordinated systems at all
levels of communication. This is especially the case with regard to the value attached to climate information
as a resource for planning and decision-making. The uncertainties in climate change show that there is no
one-size-fits-all recommendation for CSA, and practices should be site-specific in response to real-time
climate information. There is a need to move from limited sources of information to robust networking which
caters for all stakeholders with an interest in climate change. The need for multiple extension methods for
dissemination cannot be overemphasised. It is therefore recommended that:
••
Actors, including providers of information and users of information, should bridge the gap between
the content, scales, format and lead time that meet farmers’ needs in order to increase agricultural
productivity at the grassroots level;
••
Climate information services should be accessible to all actors in the value chain for effective
communication. The packaging of information in terms of content and language to meet the
expectations of users is advisable;
••
Climate information services should support farmers with skills in CSA, since most past projects on
CSA have not used climate information;
••
CIS should provide the knowledge to understand patterns of variability in the current and projected
climate, seasonal forecasts, hazards impacts, mitigation methods, land-use planning, risk
management, and resource management to achieve the three pillars of CSA;
••
Climate information services should be an integral component of CSA at all levels within the multi-
stakeholder set up and should be connected to the broad agenda of agricultural development, thus
ensuring farmers’ involvement in the design and delivery of climate information systems; and
••
Development of the National Framework for Climate Services, which will assist in coordinating and
funding activities under climate services, is needed.

advisory services?

3. 	Weather index-based insurance
as a CSA strategy
Abstract
Weather Index-based Insurance (WII) is used as a mechanism to enhance agricultural and rural
development, as well as providing an alternative method for financing disaster reduction. The index
also contributes to the three pillars of CSA, as described in the introduction to this Manual. This chapter
also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using the index. WII can be applied at three socio-
economic levels: micro, meso and macro. In many developing countries, laws and regulations are not
designed to encourage the development and use of WII. However, the chapter also presents two case
studies from Ethiopia and Kenya to illustrate the use of the index in the areas of arable agriculture and
livestock respectively. The chapter ends with a comprehensive discussion of the pros and cons of using
weather index-based insurance.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
3.1 	Background
Small-scale farmers and pastoralists in developing countries often find themselves in a poverty trap
because they are not in a position to make investments in improved agricultural practices due to weather-
related risks. Agricultural insurance, an attractive approach to managing such risks, usually involves
direct measurement of the loss or damage incurred by farmers. However, field-loss assessments are not
only expensive but also time-consuming, especially when there are a large number of smallholders or
pastoralists who cannot afford the late insurance pay-outs by companies (Greatrex et al., 2015).
WII schemes help to ensure farmers’ livelihoods, enabling them to invest in climate-smart agricultural
technologies to achieve sustainable food security. As noted in the introduction to the Manual, the
increasing frequencies of droughts, dry spells, storms and other extreme weather events in Zimbabwe are
compromising the livelihoods of small-scale farmers. Given this background, banks become risk-averse,
especially if they perceive that frequent droughts might lead to poor insurance servicing.
In the light of this scenario, WII becomes an attractive alternative to managing weather and climate risks since
it is based on weather indices, such as rainfall thresholds. This form of insurance is more straightforward
than conventional ones, generally not being contentious, since it is based on the measurable and spatial
distribution of a single weather phenomenon, such as the amount of rainfall recorded over a given time at
a particular site for a specific crop. If this amount falls below the agreed threshold, the company disburses
the money in accordance with the contract. Transactions based on such easy and quick weather-based
indices are of advantage to rural farmers, since they are not likely to sell assets in order to maintain their
livelihoods in the event of the loss or damage specified in the contract.
In low-income countries, WII facilitates two broad purposes (IFAD and WFP, 2010):
••
WII for development: a tool to bring about agricultural and rural development by helping households,
financial service providers and input suppliers cope with low-to-medium episodes of covariate risks,
for example, drought or excessive rainfall.
••
WII for disaster reduction: provides an alternative method of financing disaster reduction assistance
or relief programmes.
3.2 	Contribution to CSA
Productivity. Index insurance, especially when associated with access to credit, allows farmers to take
additional risks by investing in improved practices that increase productivity and food security, even in
situations of adverse weather conditions.
Adaptation through short-term climate risk management. In most developing countries, rainfall varies
in both seasonal totals and spatial distribution. Under such conditions, farmers are faced with the risk of
livestock loss and reductions in crop yields. Under these conditions, index insurance is designed to contain
such risks, thus making a significant contribution to farmers’ resilience. In this regard, there is considerable
interest in the potential role of insurance index in agricultural adaptation to climate change (Hellmuth et al.,
2009). This scenario applies to Zimbabwe, as elsewhere.
Adaptation through longer term climate risk management. Climate change projections (IPCC Fifth
Assessment, 2015) suggest that total rainfall is likely to decrease in Zimbabwe. Therefore, WII will become
an increasingly important adaptation strategy.
Mitigation. This will depend on the degree to which insured farmers are able to invest in improved
production practices (e.g., agro-forestry) that either enhance carbon sequestration or reduce greenhouse
gas emissions.

35
3.3 	Characteristics of WII
The usual features of a WII contract are:
••
A specific functional meteorological station is taken as the reference.
••
A trigger weather measurement is determined, e.g., the cumulative amount of rainfall in a specified
period at which disbursements are triggered in accordance with the contract.
••
A lump sum or incremental payment is determined, e.g.,  a specific amount of money per specified
rainfall amount above or below the trigger.
••
A limit to the measured parameter is set at which a maximum payment will be made.
••
The period of insurance in the contract should coincide with the length of the growing period. It can be
divided into phases, with each phase having its own trigger, increment and limit (WFP and IFD, 2010).
3.4 	Advantages of WII
WII is best designed for a weather phenomenon that is assumed to occur over a widespread area in which
there is a close relationship between weather parameters and crop yield. In arable agriculture, the best
relationships typically involve a specific crop during a specified rainy season. So far, most WII endeavours
have been based on rainfall deficits (spatial and temporal).
••
WII insurance largely overcomes the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection. As a pay-out
is determined by an objective index, such as the amount of water falling into a rain gauge or the
state of vegetation recorded by a satellite, the need to verify losses through individual farm visits is
eliminated, leading to significantly reduced administration costs. In addition, index insurance is more
resistant to moral hazard and adverse selection, which again leads to lower premiums. In this case
a pay-out does not depend on the state of the farmers’ fields, so the farmers who benefit most are
those who can keep their crops alive in a bad year.
••
Index insurance has the potential to build up the resilience of smallholders, not only by paying
out in bad years to help farmers survive and protect their assets, but also by helping to unlock
opportunities to increase productivity in years without a pay-out, which might allow them to escape
from the poverty trap or associated threats. For example, insurance can enable smallholders to
obtain credit to buy inputs or make other agricultural investments (Janzen and Carter, 2013).
3.5 	Disadvantages of WII
Basis risk. The lack of a link between on-farm losses and pay-outs that prevent moral hazard is one of the
greatest challenges involving index insurance. By definition, a weather index does not insure a farmer’s
loss directly, and multiple farmers, who will typically have somewhat different losses, must be covered by
the same index formula and data source. Farmers may receive a pay-out even when their crops survive,
or they may experience losses when a pay-out is not triggered. This scenario is called “basis risk”, a major
drawback of index-based insurance.
Technical capacity and expertise. It is imperative to have technical capacity and expertise, especially
during the initial design phase for new products in agro-meteorology and in the operationalisation of
the process.
Scarcity of credible weather data. WII is a function of its availability, spatial coverage and temporal
distribution, as well as quality of the weather data. These aspects can vary considerably both within and
between countries, especially developing countries.
Weather index-based insurance as a CSA strategy

36
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Complex situations. WII is less beneficial in complex situations, for example, localised risks such as heat
waves or microclimates, e.g., in mountainous areas. The scope for WII is also limited where agriculture
activities are compromised by other complex causes of crop loss such as pests and diseases.
3.6  Role of governments and donors
In agricultural insurance, and especially WII, investments by governments and donors are most effective in
funding market development start-up costs. In comparison to traditional indemnity insurance, the biggest
costs in WII are incurred in the product development phase.2

For long-term sustainability of WII, the role of donors is important to facilitate the development of insurance
products. This role should include creating of an appropriate enabling environment and providing specific
public goods. More specifically, donors can support governments in the development of markets in the
following respects:
••
Improvements in data systems and data collection.
••
Improvements in the legal and regulatory environment.
••
Capacity-building programmes on the use and advantages of weather insurance.
In some cases, governments may opt to provide financing for premium subsidies. The most common form
of government support to agricultural insurance is actually by directly subsidising insurance premiums.
Governments justify premium subsidies as a means of making crop insurance affordable, especially for
small farmers. However, there are a number of drawbacks regarding direct insurance premium subsidies
if they are not carefully designed. This occurs mainly when countries provide a single flat-rate premium
subsidy, typically 50% of the full commercial price of insurance for all farmers, all crop types, and all
regions at risk. These undifferentiated premium subsidies disproportionately benefit the larger farmers to
the detriment of the small and marginal farmers, and they actively encourage farmers in the highest risk-
rated regions to grow unsuitable high-risk crops. Therefore premium subsidy scales should be designed to
differentiate between crop types, risk regions and size of cover.3
3.7  Levels of intervention and business models
WII can be applied at several socio-economic levels. Micro-level farmers can use agricultural insurance to
cover themselves against the impact of adverse weather events. The premiums are either paid in full by
clients or subsidised, depending on whether the objective is protective or promotional, while at the meso-
level institutions (banks, NGOs, etc.) may use agricultural insurance to cover themselves from covariate
risks. At the macro-level, a government, institution or international donor organisation might use agricultural
insurance (especially index insurance) for a disaster relief fund.

3.8 	Improvements in the legal and regulatory environment
In many developing countries, governments do not fully recognise the role that insurance markets play
in alleviating disasters associated with weather risks. On the contrary, they are inclined to focus on
providing government aid in the wake of an extreme weather event. Unfortunately, the expectation among
smallholders that such assistance will be forthcoming compromises the need for WII. It therefore, follows
that in many developing countries, laws and regulations are not made to foster the development and use
of WII. Without proper contract law and enforcement mechanisms, the market for innovations such as WII
will hardly develop.
3.9 	Supporting improvements in data systems and collection
In supporting the development of weather insurance markets, governments can have an immediate effect
by easing access to existing relevant data. Reliable data is critical to the development of weather insurance
markets. Weather stations that provide weather data must be equipped with recording instruments that
are reliable, accurate, and should be proofed against deliberate human tampering. Quality data from
weather stations should be archived so that historic weather data can be shared. However, the recent
commercialisation of weather data by many developing countries does not augur well for the development
of insurance products. The collection of weather data using government resources should be seen as a
service to the country.

38
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Other ancillary data that are relevant to the development of weather insurance, such as yield data and
information on losses associated with extreme weather events, land use changes, input levels, and records
of past disaster management activities or infrastructural changes, should be accorded a high priority by
governments.
3.10  Case studies
In the previous sections of this chapter we have discussed the general theory of WII, but in order to
contextualise the discourse to Sub-Saharan Africa, we now summarise some case studies in Ethiopia and
Kenya that have more or less similar conditions to those in Zimbabwe.
Case Study 3.1: Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI): Kenya and Ethiopia
The International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) project, kept livestock farmers out of the poverty trap
by insuring their livestock against drought. The project faced the challenge of designing a commercially
viable form of insurance for nomadic pastoralists in remote areas of Kenya and Ethiopia with poor
communication and transport facilities. To overcome these challenges, the IBLI team mathematically
connected livestock mortality data to the satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This
was found to be highly correlated with forage availability in the area.
Project partners included insurance entities, reinsurers, research outfits and NGOs, who assist in
identifying and training local communities for the project. Since its inception in 2010, the IBLI project has
covered more than 4,000 pastoralists. Project evaluation found that IBLI provides a development benefit
from its pay-outs as participating households are less likely to sell livestock. Final assessment showed
that the project reduced the total livestock mortality risk by 25–40%.

39
Case Study 3.2: Index-Based Agriculture Insurance
The Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) – East Africa Programme is said to be one of the
largest index insurance programmes in low-income countries. It has also taken the lead in enrolling
smallholders on the basis of mobile technologies (IFC, 2013). The project aims to scale up its activities
to three million farmers across 10 countries in East Africa by 2018. Donor money is currently being used
for feasibility studies and satellite “ground-truthing” using automatic weather stations, as well as start-up
salaries during the early stages in each target country.
Essentially there are three pillars to ACRE’s operations. The first is to have an extensive range of products
based on different data sources, for example, automatic weather stations and remote sensing products.
Secondly, ACRE would like to act as a go-between for intermediate insurance companies and reinsurers,
as well as distribution channels. Thirdly, its links to the mobile money market in the form of the East African
M-PESA scheme helps with rapid enrolment and rapid pay-outs on claims. This obviates the need to visit
farmers physically, thus enabling the programme to reach more farmers than it would otherwise.
Project evaluation has shown statistically that insured farmers increased their earnings by 16% and also
invested 19% more than their uninsured counterparts. The programme provides a strong example of the
use of innovative technology solutions for the benefit of smallholders.
Case Study 3.3: Climate proofing crops and livestock through smart
insurance (Zimbabwe)
EcoFarmer is Zimbabwe’s first micro-insurance product designed to insure inputs and crops against
drought or excessive rainfall. In addition, the insured farmer receives daily weather information, farming
techniques and marketing information. Gordon Mashiri, micro-insurance expert with the mobile company
Econet Wireless in Zimbabwe, gave the interview below to a Spore correspondent at the CTA workshop
on Scaling-Up Climate-Smart Agriculture Solutions for Cereals and Livestock Farmers in Southern Africa,
in September 2016 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
How does weather index-based insurance work?
An insurance company devises an index or parameters for insurance purposes and monitors the weather
for that particular season. Farmers who buy policies are informed of the rainfall patterns within their
specific areas. Traditionally weather insurance indices cover a radius of approximately 15–20 km, but
with satellite technology a specific policy can be provided for a specific farmer, even though the whole
index will be the same for the region or country.
How does this type of insurance help farmers adopt climate-smart solutions at an
affordable cost?
Weather index insurance is a risk management tool that has to be used in conjunction with other tools that
are being adopted, such as conservation agriculture and good agronomic practices. Given the changes
in climate, farmers need back-up cover to ensure they can retain their inputs and have something in
reserve for subsistence during a period of adverse weather conditions.
How have farmers responded to this insurance?
Some farmers are aware of it but there is still a lot of work to be done to raise awareness about how
weather index insurance works and about its benefits. Farmers need to understand that insurance is not
a gamble but a fall-back plan. Its principles need to be understood by farmers, farmers’ organisations
and other actors in the agriculture value chain.
Weather index-based insurance as a CSA strategy

40
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Why are farmers not using a tool that can help them?
Most programmes have been pilots and not commercialised. For those that have gone commercial,
they have done so in specific regions with the assistance of donor organisations, and not all farmers
have been exposed to them. We now need to scale up the products and invest in farmer education and
understanding. Then we can roll insurance out to everyone.
What is the significance of bundling in the provision of climate-smart agricultural
services?
Bundling focuses on the value chain and all the farmers’ requirements by offering the various components
that farmers require in a single basket. This could be information services, farmers’ subscriptions, weather
index insurance itself, farmers’ discounts and market-related information, all of which can be bundled
into one basket which the farmer purchases. There will be cross-subsidisation within that basket, making
it easier to scale and target many farmers using one bundle. This is opposed to different entities knocking
on the same farmer’s door, which is inefficient.
What is needed to overcome the current lack of awareness and uptake?
A demand-driven approach to insurance is required where farmers’ groups and organisations come
together and understand that insurance is for their benefit. They need to push the weather insurance
agenda and not have someone else do it. Once they demand it, insurers, re-insurers and other partners
will come together and offer products that will benefit the whole agricultural value chain.

3.11  Discussion
Attributes of successful index insurance
••
For WII to be successful, it must be appropriately designed to protect the farmer against the intended
risk and should be positively correlated with losses. This requires significant expert input to answer
queries on how to quantify losses, for example, “How can we measure losses as defined in the
contract?” or “How far from a rain-gauge station does a farm have to be to trigger payment?”
••
The very nature of WII makes it impossible to eliminate basis risk entirely.  This means that there
has to be good communication with clients so that they understand the risks that are covered and
are prepared for the possibility of a basis risk event. Attaining this level of mutual understanding calls
for considerable effort.
••
The WII should have a clearly quantified degree of uncertainty so that a monetary value can be
assigned. Smallholders should be able to understand their contracts before buying them.
••
There needs to be a demonstrable benefit in buying insurance. This requires the insurance to be
packaged with inputs that can demonstrate positive gains.
However, some potential pitfalls of insurance have also been noted. While insurance might decrease short-
term vulnerability after an adverse weather event, it is difficult to assess the long-term impact on adapting
to climate change. By encouraging people to continue engaging in highly climate-sensitive economic
activities or making them more risk-averse with respect to insurance than they would have been otherwise,
might prove maladaptive in the long run. Incentives for risk management need to be aligned properly with
insurance premiums to avoid maladaptation.

41
3.12  Can Index-based insurance for vulnerable farmers be scaled up?
A common concern with index insurance has been the low demand from poor smallholders and pastoralists
that has been observed, even though they are the most vulnerable to weather-related risk. This has been
a disadvantage of up-scaling index-based insurance.
Having said that, access to credit and the adoption of better production technologies have been the hallmark
of the most successful index programmes. This has resulted in a net positive effect on the uptake of more
lucrative production technologies. Evaluations show that livelihood benefits derived from insurance are
appreciated and that they currently benefit women farmers more than men.
The case studies discussed in this chapter show that index-based insurance could benefit smallholder
farmers in many low-income countries. In spite of the absence of credible quantitative projections, we
can safely say that the noticeable increase in smallholders buying index insurance suggests that such
programmes have captured a considerable part of the hitherto suppressed demand of smallholders.
3.13  Recommendations and lessons learnt
The case studies have also shown that index insurance will not be appropriate in every circumstance and
that there are still several challenges to be overcome, including data management, basis risk and logistics.
The following points ought to be noted with respect to WII in developing countries:
a.  Insurance offsets farmers' losses
Many case studies have shown that index insurance has helped farmers to offset crop losses, thus
maintaining their livelihoods. The increase in food security stemming from index insurance constitutes
a value that enables smallholders to pay the premiums. Other tangible benefits include asset protection
and access to credit. The use of insurance as a means to act as a buffer against crop losses is the main
attraction for smallholders.
b.  Holistic approaches
A notable number of case studies have integrated index insurance into broad development programmes in
the quest for climate risk management. The value of index insurance is that it can be perceived as a climate
risk management portfolio. It has been designed to target risks such as drought, together with other risk
management approaches that are more appropriate for other extremes of weather.
Case studies have shown that it is imperative to collaborate with smallholders, policymakers, scientists and
agricultural practitioners. This scenario is ideal for the common appreciation of derived products, trade-
offs, disadvantages and limitations on solutions.
c.  Farmer-driven design
Index insurance studies have shown that substantial benefits are realised when smallholders are
consulted during the design process. This is important because farmers need to understand the operations
of the insurance programme so as to build trust and common understanding, as well as to minimise
misunderstandings in the whole process. Case studies have also shown that farmer-driven designs are
one way to ensure success in index insurance.

d.  Building trust and capacity
Education and capacity-building have proved to be essential aspects of successful case studies. Basically,
insurance is a commitment to pay later for a premium paid now. Farmers' buy-in to the insurance process is
vital for ensuring success. Partnering with outfits that have already acquired the trust of clients can expedite
the successful scaling up of index insurance in developing countries. Indian insurance projects are good
examples of partnering companies that have already earned the trust of clients. A sizable proportion of the
budget can be spent on trainers' salaries, communication and radio slots.
e.  Credible science, technology and basis risk
The effective communication of scientific research on index insurance has facilitated the scaling up of
many case studies, especially in environments with poor data or reductions of basis risk. Basing index
insurance projects on credible scientific findings and close cooperation with research communities has
been the key to the success of many case studies by facilitating the use of agro-meteorological findings in
quantifying basis risk and its communication to smallholders.
In the case of data-scarce environments, it is now common practice to use remotely sensed data from
satellites, whose rainfall estimates can be complemented with the satellite vegetation index, farmer
interviews and ground-truthed data.

Abstract
This chapter addresses the critical links of gender with climate change and agriculture. In Zimbabwe and
the rest of the developing world, both women and men are smallholders, yet the role that women play is
often unrecognised. Globally, women make up 43% of the agricultural labour force, and in Zimbabwe they
provide 70% of agricultural labour. Women face structural barriers that create gender gaps and inequalities.
Women farmers in southern Africa, as a result, face barriers in adopting CSA practices, including unequal
access to credit, technology and agricultural inputs as well as capacity-building. The changing climate
is poised to exacerbate these inequalities unless measures are taken to address them. This chapter
demonstrates that climate-smart agriculture practices and policies will need to take these barriers into
account and develop solutions to address them. Highlighted CSA case studies not only improve food
security and increase incomes, but also benefit women and reduce gender barriers. Finally, the chapter
emphasises the importance of developing and implementing gender-responsive climate change and
agricultural practices, and of mainstreaming gender into academic curricula.

4.1	  Introduction: gender, agriculture and climate change in Africa
Both women and men in Africa are smallholders. Women make up just under half (43%) of the global
agricultural labour force, while in Zimbabwe, 70% of agricultural labour is provided by women, a sector
with the lowest wages in relation to other economic sectors (FAO, 2011; Madzwamuse, 2010). This role
is increasing, especially as a result of migration out of rural areas by men and young people in search of
employment. Despite this, the contribution of women smallholders often goes unrecognised; work activities
such as subsistence agriculture are often underestimated or excluded for reasons such as limitation of data
sources and data collection approaches which do not include the unpaid work of women and girls in and
around households, as in vegetable gardens and food-processing (Twyman et al., 2014). As a result, as
found in a recent review of gender and CSA in southern Africa, women farmers in the region face barriers in
their ability to adopt CSA practices, including unequal access to credit, technology and agricultural inputs,
as well as capacity-building (Perch and Byrd, 2015).
Therefore, in implementing CSA, it is important to understand the needs, priorities and challenges of
different stakeholders. Gender relations, opportunities, socio-cultural norms, access to resources and
power dynamics across social lines may lead women and men to have different knowledge, skills and
perspectives. They may also have different opportunities and constraints that may help or hinder the
adoption of CSA. In fact, if implemented without consideration of gender and social inequalities, CSA
practices will fail to take advantage of opportunities to improve livelihoods and may instead increase
these inequalities.
4.1.1  Developing CSA solutions with women farmers
Women farmers are vulnerable to climate change in a number of ways. Their high dependence on natural
resources, added to social and economic inequality results in lower levels of access to and control of key
productive assets such as land, information and technology. In Zimbabwe, women make up 24% of the
labour force in the non-agricultural sector, and their real incomes are three times lower than those of men.
Lower levels of decision-making in households and communities also translate to lesser control over their
own and family labour, and over the proceeds of household production. As a result, women farmers are
particularly affected by climate change, having lower adaptive capacity in many cases and face greater
barriers than men in responding and adapting to climate impacts, and they may be less able to select
adaptation options in agriculture, including CSA (FAO, 2011; Madzwamuse, 2010; Huyer, 2016; Perez
et al., 2015). In surveys in East Africa, women cited financial and resource limitations as reasons for not
implementing adaptive changes in their agricultural practices (Jost et al., 2016).
A study of vulnerable households4 in Swaziland found that the highest indicators of vulnerability are
increases in the number of sick members and of dependents (Nkonde et al., 2014). Since these two
issues are closely related to women’s workload, as they are family caregivers and child carers, women’s
empowerment and access to labour support will be an important factor in reducing vulnerability and
increasing resilience in the region. These are also important factors that enhance the ability of women
farmers and female-headed households to adopt CSA.
Solutions developed to support women farmers will need to take into account access to resources, assets
and decision-making at the household level. Because of the different work that men and women do, which
is largely dictated by gender norms, men and women perceive climate change differently and are affected
by it in different ways. Strategies for implementation need to be developed in consultation and continuous
assessment with women smallholders (Jost et al., 2015; Duong et al., 2016). Many conservation agriculture
approaches have failed to achieve nutrition goals and in fact have increased women’s workloads, for
4
Vulnerability is defined as the inability to withstand the adverse impact of exposure to stresses or shocks associated with
environmental and social change, and the absence of the capacity to adapt to the impact (Nkonde et al., 2014).

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
example, emphasis on manual weeding depends on women’s labour in many areas, and as a result, these
practices may not be adopted by women (Beuchelt and Badstue, 2013).
Nevertheless, when supported with access to productive assets and capacity development, women can be
active agents of change and climate resilience. Engaging women in technology design and management
decisions improves community outcomes, as in Honduras, where women have re-designed eco-stoves
and developed improved agroforestry management systems (Hottle, 2015). In southern Africa women
possess valuable local knowledge for resilience: they are often the managers and producers of seed,
and they play a role in seed banks and seed production (Nyasimi et al., 2014). We also know that, when
women’s awareness of and access to information on climate-smart practices increases, they do adopt
them (Twyman et al., 2014, Jost et al., 2015) and that the resilience of households, communities and food
systems is increased as a result (World Bank, FAO, IFAD 2015).
This is true also for mitigation. Women and men will often have different responses to mitigation, and
valuing women’s knowledge can lead to new technologies, management practices, organisational forms
and political strategies to encourage low-emission agricultural development. However, mitigation incentives
related to the carbon market involve market actors, particularly private investors requiring high returns for
investments through emissions reductions, new kinds of monitoring and accountability, and timelines which
may marginalise poor women, although carbon payment schemes could theoretically provide new sources
of financing for climate-smart agriculture. Additionally, mitigation analysis and policy recommendations are
often not accessible or useful to local communities and development practitioners, while the models and
related research often take a gender-blind approach that avoids addressing long-standing gender and
social inequalities (Edmunds et al., 2013).
Nevertheless, research demonstrates:
••
If constraints in access to finances, information and workload are addressed, women can design and
adopt innovative tools and techniques in farming.
••
New technologies and practices for climate change will be adopted more successfully when they are
appropriate to women’s interests, resources and demands.
••
Increased knowledge and information for women leads to their increased status in the family and
community, as well as improved production and sustainable livelihoods.
••
Gender-sensitive, socially-inclusive community efforts provide greater opportunities for communities
to build resilience from their existing strengths and to experience the ensuing benefits.
••
If women are given equal opportunities with men, they can help in making better farm management
decisions (Huyer et al., 2015; Huyer, 2016; Jost et al., 2016; Mittal, 2016; Nyasimi et al., 2016).
In short, “greater, differentiated, but equal access to CSA tools and techniques as well as climate services
could potentially change how resources are used and improve the balance of gendered roles in agriculture
[in southern Africa]” (Perch and Byrd, 2015). It can also increase productivity, improve food security and
nutrition levels, as well as educational outcomes for children (World Bank, FAO, IFAD, 2015). To illustrate
this, Figure 4.1 shows a female sorghum farmer in western Kenya.

4.2 	Can CSA contribute to gender equality and women’s empowerment
case studies from Africa?
The following case studies from different countries in Africa illustrate these trends and show how CSA can
contribute to better gender equality and social development outcomes.
4.2.1 	 Women champion knowledge- and technology-based approaches to
climate-smart agriculture in Nyando, Kenya
In Nyando, the late onset of seasonal rainfall leads to the occasional flooding of agricultural fields, destroying
crops and eroding productive top soil. Early rainfall can substantially increase the chance of longer dry
spells, often leading to pre-season pest outbreaks. Farmers must often replant to ensure a harvest. The
Obinju Women’s Group comprising of 21 members, uses SMS along with other CSA approaches to help
them plan their planting seasons and adapt to climate variability. These practices rely less on rain-fed
crop production and more on a mixture of closed polythene tube greenhouses and open spaces fitted
with water-harvesting structures and drip supply lines. This protects crops from drought, flooding, insect
and pest attacks. Four pilot units are now operational in seven villages, showcasing highly diversified and
innovative vegetable and bean seed production under drip irrigation.
The Obinju group has made changes to the technology used to supply water to the drip lines. This is a
labour- and energy-saving solar-driven water pump which ensures year-round supply of water with very low
maintenance costs. Along with other women leaders, entrepreneurs, and farmers, the group has received
special training on how to access and use climate services and agro-advisories. The latest data show that
these interventions have helped reduce the number of households that experience at least two months
per year with one or no meals per day by 60 percentage points. Together with 50 mixed farmer and youth
groups in 106 villages in Nyando region that use CSA approaches, a combined savings and loan portfolio
serves 1,675 households, mobilising USD 69,500 in a community innovation fund. Borrowing from the
facility has reached 90%. Main uses for the loans include buying food, procuring farm inputs, payment of

4.2.2 Gender differences in the adoption of CSA practices in Lushoto, Tanzania
Women and men in Lushoto, Tanzania, were asked to rank a range of CSA practices based on their
benefits and potential to support adaptation to climate change. There were significant gender differences in
the preference for and use of CSA practices. For example, 80% of the men cited minimal use of tillage as
important compared to 20% of the women, while intercropping was cited as important by 72% of the women
compared to 28% of men. The three most commonly cited CSA practices for women were intercropping,
strip-cropping, using inorganic fertilisers and early planting. For men, the preferred practices were minimal
tillage, cutting and carrying feed for livestock, and using improved crop varieties. There were no significant
gender differences in preference for use of chemical fertilisers and strip-cropping.
On average, male-headed households integrated 10 CSA practices, compared to five CSA practices
for women-headed households. The differences between male- and female-headed households can be
attributed to the following factors (Table 4.1):
a.	 Women have limited access to and use of assets such as land, and hence they are unable to adopt
long-term practices such as agroforestry;

49
b.	 Women pursue different livelihood portfolios, such as household crops and small livestock
management, as opposed to cash crops and large livestock, which are managed by men;
c.	 Men tend to take more risks; and
d.	 Men have more access to assets, including credit and extension services, as compared to women
(Nyasimi et al., 2016; Perez et al., 2015).

4.2.3  Gender equality in accessing climate information services
Generally men and women across Africa share common interests in climate and weather information;
however, they also use this to make different decisions and to inform different priorities. The extended impacts
and importance of these different decisions on their lives and livelihoods should not be underestimated. For
example, women farmers in Senegal were more interested in information on forecasts of rainfall cessation
at the end of the season than forecasts of rainfall onset, since their planting season began a month
later than that of men. For them the risk of early rainfall cessation during millet flowering was greater
(Tall et al., 2014).
Women and men also access information through different channels. Farmers in Lushoto, Tanzania, were
asked where and how they accessed CSA information. The responses indicated that women tended to use
primarily informal institutions such as the market, village groups and other farmers. Religious organisations
were used to a somewhat lesser extent. This supports research elsewhere indicating that women tend to
use informal networks and organisations for information, rather than organised extensions, NGOs or ICT
(Tall et al., 2014; Perez et al., 2015; Perch and Byrd, 2015). Young people especially preferred the newest
information and communication technologies, namely mobile phones and television (Nyasimi et al., 2016).

Research in southern Africa shows gender differences in information preferences as well. In one study,
women farmers in the region tended to see government and farmers’ organisations as important support
structures for the adoption of CSA, while men rated government organisations as much less important
(Perch and Byrd, 2015). Results from stakeholder workshops in five southern African countries5 show
that a) men and women contribute differently to the value chain; b) women make a larger contribution to
agricultural labour on smallholdings; and c) gender differences exist in access to credit and agricultural
inputs for CSA (Perch and Byrd, 2015). Figure 4.3 shows the success of equal gender roles in CSA training.

4.3  Practice: adoption of CSA by women in Zimbabwe
4.3.1  Barriers to the adoption of CSA
Women in Zimbabwe (especially those belonging to female-headed households) are already in a
disadvantaged position, and the negative impacts of climate change threaten to further exacerbate this
inequality. Women’s limited access to productive resources, combined with their disadvantaged position in
society, and heavy reliance on natural resources for food and income, increases their vulnerability to climate
change-induced stress. These gender differences between men and women imply that their vulnerabilities
differ, and hence their needs in terms of CSA will differ as well. For example, in 2010 the village of Chirume
in Shurugwi District experienced a prolonged mid-season drought that led to crop failure, increasing the
burden for women in feeding their families (Brown et al., 2012). The majority of Zimbabwean women living
in rural areas (and dependent on farming as a livelihood) are extremely vulnerable to climate change due to
a number of factors. These include cultural restrictions on mobility, in that they have to seek male consent
before moving during drought and famine, as well as a gendered division of household labour, lower levels

51
of educational attainment, and minimum control over land and other productive assets due to unequal
property and land rights. Poverty also exacerbates women’s and girls’ marginalisation and vulnerability
(Takunda, 2015; Brown et al., 2012). It is therefore imperative to incorporate gender considerations into
climate change, especially climate-smart agriculture.
Sometimes the impacts of climate stresses have led to changes in roles and responsibilities among women,
men and young people. In Chirume village, men and youths became involved in water collection (usually
done by women) after heavy rains destroyed a dam, and community members were required to travel over
a kilometre to fetch water (Brown et al., 2012).
No agricultural technology or practice is gender-neutral, this being true for CSA as well. As outlined above,
gender inequalities in Zimbabwe can hinder adaptation to climate change, including the adoption and
scaling up of CSA. For example, TerrAfrica, which works in twelve6 sub-Saharan countries, found that
women farmers have insecure land tenure, limited assets, lack of capital, limited farm inputs, limited
mobility and access to climate information, and restricted decision-making power (TerrAfrica, 2011).  All this
can contribute to low adoption of CSA practices.
In Zimbabwe, women often lack knowledge of feasible options for adapting their production systems
because they do not receive extension services (Horell and Krishnan, 2007).  The institutions responsible
for providing early warning systems and agro-advisories do not provide localised disaster risks, nor do they
use appropriate information dissemination strategies that target women in rural areas. As a result, women
can experience difficulties in adapting to the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events,
especially drought (Macherera and Chimbari, 2016). A lack of accurate and timely climate information
and technical advisory services, coupled with the unavailability and lack of access to inputs (including
suitable crop varieties), constrain their ability to assess the risks and benefits of CSA and to make informed
investment decisions. Competing resource use, e.g., labour, cash and biomass, will influence decisions on
investing in CSA, so that adoption tends to be low among women. Finally, women lack access to financial
resources that can enable them to adopt technologies that mitigate against climate change such as water
tanks for rainwater harvesting.
4.3.2 	Importance of gender for climate-smart agriculture and rural

development in Zimbabwe
Social-cultural practices shape how women and men deal with the impacts of climate change. Women
farmers are particularly vulnerable to these impacts due to their limited capacity to invest or manage
risk. Women contribute to food production and security in a changing climate, and reports show that
increasing women’s access to agricultural resources to equal those of men can increase yields by 20–30%
(FAO, 2011).
Addressing the triple challenge of CSA to increase food security, incomes and low-carbon agricultural
practices can also contribute to reducing gender barriers to food production and better livelihoods.
Recognising the role of women as drivers of smallholder farming (and in turn CSA) will ensure that the CSA
objectives of sustainably increasing agricultural productivity among smallholders and building resilience
to climate change are realised (FAO, 2013). Improving access to land resources, climate services, credit
and markets has the potential to enhance the adoption and success of CSA and also to reduce gender
differences in the management of climate risks.

4.3.3 	Integrating a gender perspective in curricula of higher and tertiary
institutions
Engendering agriculture curricula in higher and tertiary institutions in Zimbabwe will ensure that future
field practitioners, researchers and extensionists are better prepared to develop gender-responsive CSA
research, practice and technologies. This in turn will encourage the integration of gender into agriculture
policy and programming (case study 4.1).
Case Study 4.1: Gender-responsive Pedagogy (GRP) programme, Zimbabwe
Implemented by the Forum for African Women Educationalists Zimbabwe Chapter (FAWEZI), GRP
mainstreams gender equality concepts and practices in primary and secondary teacher-training
institutions. This includes developing curricula and conducting training programmes for students,
staff, government and NGOs with the goal of facilitating the integration of gender and development in
policy formulation and decision-making. GRP is also involved in directly influencing government policy
and public awareness to mainstream gender into educational curricula. It is anticipated that raising
awareness in this way will influence different sectors of society to ensure a positive impact on women
in agriculture.
A meeting hosted by the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) in Zimbabwe in 2015
recommended the establishment of a gender institute to promote gender mainstreaming in the curricula
of academic programmes (biophysical and social sciences), as well as in different faculties and areas of
specialisation, such as forestry, soils, natural resource management, ICT and policy. Several universities
in Zimbabwe currently offer agriculture, natural resources and gender studies as one of their programmes.
Notable here is the Women’s University of Africa located in Harare, which offers agriculture and social
science programmes, as well as gender and development studies. This university is affiliated to UNICEF
and seeks to be a leader in promoting gender equality in tertiary education in Africa. The university has the
capacity to develop gender and CSA programmes to attract students and experts who are interested in
such issues. Another option is the development of short courses (one day to two weeks or more) on gender
and CSA. The University of Zimbabwe currently offers short courses on gender, crop and animal sciences.
Chibero and Mulezu Colleges of Agriculture are also potential candidate institutions for integrating gender
and CSA into the curriculum.
One of the challenges to integrating gender into the curricula of higher and tertiary institutions is the
availability of qualified academic staff able to teach gender studies and counter negative attitudes. Not
many institutions offer gender courses and those that do tend to be located in social science programmes.
Agricultural and related science programmes seldom offer such courses; so that academic staff qualified
to teach CSA and gender are rare. It is important to note that academic staff who have attended training
workshops on gender mainstreaming have reported that the workshops had a profound positive effect
(Onsongo, 2011). Training on gender mainstreaming should be recognised as a social and economic policy
concern in higher and tertiary academic institutions.
Acquiring gender knowledge and skills should also be considered a mandatory requirement in higher
education. Integrating a gender aspect at all levels, including national programmes (for policymakers),
curricula and other forms of teaching, learning and research (for educationalists), will reinforce better use
of gender concepts in all sectors.

53
4.4  Gender-responsive policymaking to scale up CSA
Five countries in southern Africa7 (including Zimbabwe) have developed national agricultural policies. A
review of these policies shows that gender, climate change,  disaster risk reduction and management
are all mentioned. Unfortunately, the gender content only consists of a one-way connection to agriculture
or broader environmental or natural resource management factors. Given the current changing climate
and its devastating effects on food security, livelihoods and the economy, agricultural policies are needed
that are both climate- and gender-responsive. Zimbabwe is committed to ensuring gender equality in its
control of productive resources, entrepreneurship and employment. Since 2004, the country has enacted
a number of national development policies8 aimed at improving the lives of women through activities such
as livelihood diversification, involvement in non-farm employment, empowerment and access to financial
services. However, little positive change has been seen to date (Madzwamuse, 2010).
Women, the young and other vulnerable groups (e.g., the disabled) in Zimbabwe are disproportionately
affected by the impacts of climate change (e.g., drought and famine), and they remain largely absent
from decision-making processes on agricultural policies and climate change adaptation (Government of
Zimbabwe, 2014; Brown et al., 2012). The National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) of
2014 mainstreams gender, children and the young, people living with HIV and AIDS, and other vulnerable
groups into all climate change interventions (Government of Zimbabwe, 2014). Some of the interventions
that target women, the young and other vulnerable groups include:
••
Strengthening the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups.
••
Enhancing provision of early warning systems on droughts, floods and disease outbreaks, and
ensuring a coordinated approach in providing them with emergency services.
••
Developing culturally appropriate and gender-sensitive labour-saving green technologies.
••
Using integrated adaptation responses that combine indigenous knowledge from the elderly with
expert insights, disseminate updated information on climate change, and raise awareness of
vulnerable groups on disaster preparedness.
The NCCRS, with an allocation of USD 25 million to gender, ensures that national planning and budgeting
will incorporate a gender-sensitive perspective. However, this sector has received the least amount of
funding compared to other sectors.
Zimbabwe’s national agricultural, environmental, natural resource and other land-related policy and
planning needs to recognise the roles and contributions of men, women and young people to ensure that
their needs are addressed equitably. Ensuring the allocation of adequate financial resources to support the
gender-responsive actions outlined by the policies is a necessary step towards improving gender equality
and empowering women. Moving forward, gender research is of fundamental importance in informing the
development of CSA practices that will benefit women and men. The use of sex-disaggregated data in CSA
will raise the profile of climate change as a policy priority at all levels and inform an integrated approach
to climate policy across a variety of other economic sectors in Zimbabwe.  At the regional level, there is a
commitment from institutions such as the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to
ensure that at least 80% of the beneficiaries of agriculture and climate change adaptation and mitigation
interventions are female farmers and female-headed households (COMESA, 2015).
Embedding CSA within gender-responsive policies will have the potential to extend CSA beyond food
production into agricultural value chains (case study 4.2). In doing so, adoption of CSA will increase, and its
relevance among women and smallholder farmers will be strengthened to meet changing and increasingly

Among these policies are the Zimbabwe Economic Development Strategy (ZEDS) (2007 – 2010); STERP I and STERP II

(GERPMI); and the Broad Based Women’s Economic Empowerment Framework (BBWEEF).

variable climate realities. Among the policy actions that the Zimbabwean government can promote to scale
up CSA are:
••
Working with women, researchers and extension agencies to identify, test and promote suitable
gender transformative CSA solutions for different agro-ecological and socio-economic contexts;
••
Improving the coordination of policies and strengthening local national and regional institutions

Case study 4.2: Using the market place to build the resilience of women in Honde Valley,
Zimbabwe
The SNV Netherlands Development Organisation is working with women farmers in Zimbabwe along
the value chain, from production to market. Using a transformative gender model called “balancing
benefits”, women are involved in increasing production and ensuring food security, while at the same
time building resilience to climate change. The programmes are involved in changing gender norms and
relations within the household and community in order to allow women access to market opportunities.
Through the «balancing benefits» model, women are empowered to take an active role in decisions
around productive resources and assets, including labour-saving technologies. Of importance is the
ability of women to engage in value-added enterprises and thus influence business environments both
to support women in agri-business and manage climate risks. The success of this programme is being
scaled up through SNV’s Rural Agro-dealers Restocking Programme (RARP), a market-led model for
revitalising agricultural production by providing the right farm inputs at the right time, as well as low-claim
insurance and loans to reduce risk and build capacity.
Another strategy for enhancing the scaling up of CSA is the promotion of gender-responsive ICT-based
tools, farmers’ fairs and participatory videos of technology adoption. The current Zimbabwe Policy for
ICT (2015) aims to mainstream gender in the design and implementation of ICT programmes to ensure
that both sexes (women and men) and ages (youth and the old) can access and receive information and
opportunities. In Zimbabwe, women’s organisations have been instrumental in providing a networking
platform to share knowledge and information. Connecting women’s organisations with gender-responsive
ICT and other participatory methods can also be an effective scaling-up approach for CSA (Ragasa, 2012).
4.5  Conclusion and recommendations
In conclusion, we know that women farmers do adopt CSA practices when they have the information,
resources and capacity to implement them (Jost et al., 2016). However, serious gender gaps in accessing
credit, technology and agricultural inputs, capacity-building and household decision-making hinder their
adoption. These key constraints are linked to the assets women possess and their levels of access to
income and common property resources. They are also related to the extent to which they interact with and
benefit from social support institutions, government and NGOs (Perez et al., 2015). Incorporating a gender

55
equality perspective into policy-making and implementation is necessary to ensure that the vulnerabilities
of women and other disadvantaged groups are identified and addressed. During national planning and
budgeting, policymakers should consider sex-disaggregated data in order to highlight inequalities among
women, as well as other marginalised groups, including the young. Existing guidelines, e.g., IUCN (2011)
gender guidelines for national adaptation plans, can be used as a framework for mainstreaming gender
in climate-smart agriculture. Additionally, women’s organisations’ networking platforms can be used to
identify gender-disaggregated priority research and translate the findings from science (including traditional
knowledge) into policy actions. Developing a sustainable dialogue forum for both female and male farmers,
agricultural and climate change experts, and policymakers to agree on a shared vision and approach to
gender-responsive CSA in Zimbabwe will increase the adaptive capacity of all farmers in the country for
sustainable and resilient livelihoods.
Specific Recommendations
••
Identify and scale up viable gender-sensitive CSA solutions.
••
Identify and prioritise CSA support structures such as gender-responsive investment and financial
instruments.
••
Support and promote women’s groups in smallholder agriculture initiatives in a sustainable livelihoods
framework.
••
Develop, track and monitor policy implementation and service delivery to women in such a way that
they do not intensify pre-existing inequalities between men and women.
••
Undertake participatory and consultative processes which include women, the young and other less
represented social groups in the planning, design and implementation of CSA activities.
••
Provide women-targeted training in CSA technologies and practices.
••
Nevertheless, participation is not sufficient: increases in control and decision-making by women on
the use of resources are still needed to take gender mainstreaming in CSA to the next level.
••
Support actions to increase women’s income and access to finance through savings and credit, as
well as diversified vegetable and market gardening.
••
Develop women-targeted climate services (information and insurance) and appropriate channels for
these services to support women’s access to and use of productive assets.
••
Ensure that CSA practices and technologies do not increase women’s workload but are geared
towards reducing women’s burdens.
••
Raise awareness among men to help them understand the causes and consequences of socially
constructed norms (e.g., issues of masculinity), and also to ensure that they do not feel left out.

5.	 The landscape approach
Abstract
Diverse ecosystems in Zimbabwe are considered to be under the threat of climate change. In the face
of such challenges, Zimbabwe needs to adapt a rigorous landscape approach that will have a positive
impact across sectors. This approach places human welfare at the centre of the land-use decision-making
process. Normally, the landscape approach is categorised into three components for operationalisation,
viz.: landscape goals embracing multiple objectives at different scales, adaptive planning, management,
and collaboration, and comprehensive sector involvement. In this chapter, 10 key principles, which can
be taken as a checklist for the implementation and operationalisation of landscape management, are
discussed. Furthermore, good governance is imperative in landscape approaches, since this determines
the levels of transparency through which resources are shared. Among the issues that are critical in
the landscape approach are capacity-building, land tenure security, integrated land-use planning and
stakeholder participation. Barriers to the landscape approach include policy and institutional hurdles,
socio-economic factors, lack of knowledge, and uncoordinated funding for mitigation and adaptation. The
chapter also suggests some solutions to these barriers.
Key words: conservation, degradation, ecosystems, landscape approach, land use, natural resources,
sustainability
Key messages
i.
To meet national food security objectives as well as needs of a variety of stakeholders in a specific
landscape, land-use planning and the management of natural resources, need to be coordinated
across sectors and through a participatory and consensus-based decision-making process;
ii.
Attaining ecologically sound landscape approaches calls for building national and local capacity in
developing inclusive governance arrangements. This includes improvements in tenure security and
the recognition of individual and groups rights;
iii. Public policies regarding those sectors that have a significant impact on landscape dynamics need
to be harmonised, and land-use legislation needs to be enforced through strengthened national and
local institutions and governance;
iv.	 The implementation of REDD+ can play a catalytic role in promoting a landscape approach by
reinforcing the forest-agriculture nexus; and
v.
A common knowledge base needs to be developed on feasible concepts, techniques and methods
to allow stakeholders to develop, implement and monitor landscape approaches.

5.1  Introduction
Land is critical for the production of various goods and services that ensure the well-being of the human
race. There are competing needs, and viewpoints on land resource by various stakeholders (land/soil,
water, agroforestry, watershed, fisheries, forest, urbanisation, industrialisation and agriculture). 'Silo' based
approaches are unsustainable hence the need for a holistic approach. Landscape approach is a set of tools,
methods and strategies that aim at achieving multiple objectives (social, economic and environmental) of
the stakeholders by optimising the interests of all. It aims at achieving ecosystem interests (conservation);
economic interests (production) and livelihoods.
Several meetings, such as the Seventeenth Session of the Commission on Sustainable Development
(CSD 17), First Global Conference on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change and the RIO+20
United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, all acknowledged the importance of land-based
sectors for increasing agricultural productivity. This also involves safeguarding important environmental
services, such as water regulation, pollination, biodiversity and climate regulation, as well as reduced
emissions and increased sequestration, and improving livelihoods and food security. To achieve these
challenging goals, an integrated landscape approach has to be in place to facilitate the diversity of
land uses across the landscape, interactions between these different land uses and their associated
components.
5.2  Unsustainable management of natural resources
Farming, forestry and fishery systems have provided goods and services to a growing global population.
However, this has often been achieved at the expense of sustainability with respect to the environment.
The consequence of this mode of providing services is the degradation of landscapes, land and water
resources, as well as the loss of biodiversity and other ecosystem services. This deplorable situation has
been exacerbated by targeted market-driven approaches that tend to optimise the production derived from
specific enterprises (e.g., crop or livestock production) that focus on single products that rely on subsidies
or support services, such as credit, input supply and marketing.
In addition, some systems are ineffective and unsustainable due to insufficient technical knowledge or a
lack of access to resources and investments that could help to minimise the degradation of the natural
resource base and the encroachment of agriculture into existing virgin ecosystems (FAO, 2010).
5.3  Climate change threat to ecosystems in Zimbabwe
Diverse ecosystems in Zimbabwe are considered to be under the risk of climate change (Zimbabwe
National Response Strategy to Climate Change, 2015). Climate change impacts, which are largely negative,
will lead to environmental and socio-economic threats to the country’s agricultural landscape. Extreme
weather events, such as droughts and floods, are predicted to become more frequent, as described in the
introductory chapter of this Manual. The devastating 2016 drought in southern Africa is a recent example
of such extreme weather events.
In the face of such challenges, Zimbabwe needs to adapt a rigorous landscape approach that will have a
positive cross-sectoral impact on social, economic and environmental perspectives. The country has a rich
biological diversity, which provides ecosystem services such as food, medicine, energy sources, building
and craft materials, as well as spiritual, cultural and aesthetic services. This biodiversity also regulates
climate, soil fertility and outbreaks of pests and diseases, and maintains functional ecosystems. Vegetation
is characterised as mainly savannah woodland interspersed with open grassed drainage lines or dambos
(wetlands). However, the recurrent droughts affecting Zimbabwe have also resulted in the loss of a number

of plant and animal species. Furthermore, degraded rangelands will impact negatively on the livelihoods
of farmers, particularly small-scale, resource-poor farmers living in marginal areas who are likely to get
trapped in poverty. The World Food Programme estimated that 4.1 million people in Zimbabwe were in
need of food following the severe drought of 2016 (http://www1.wfp.org/countries/zimbabwe – accessed
on 17/07/2017).
5.4  Perspectives on the landscape approach
The landscape approach (LA) is based on large-scale processes in an integrated and multidisciplinary
formulation that takes into account natural resources management which includes environmental and
livelihood concerns. The approach ropes in human activities and their institutions as part and parcel of the
system. It is anchored in the fact that the main problems are not location-specific and that the appropriate
development agenda calls for multi-stakeholder inter­ventions to be brought into play. The LA places human
well-being and needs at the centre of the land-use decision-making process, as well as the rights and
cultural values of the farmers involved, in as much as it relates to their land-use objectives. This approach
also includes a commitment to environmentally friendly solutions and the expected durable success of
sustainable development initiatives (on landscape approaches, FAO, 2012b; Farina, 2006).
Farm-level management decisions on such issues of water use, soil management, production system
choices and the use of landscape features such as hedgerows affect the surrounding landscape and its
associated ecosystem services. Decisions on the use of farm resources and common property resources
in the surrounding landscape are a function of the socio-economic situation of the users. It is affected by
their tenure and labour security, access to services and markets, as well as their education levels and
financial and organisational capacities.
New holistic approaches and technologies for sus­tainably managing farmlands, rangelands and forests
have emerged. For example, integrated watershed and river-basin man­agement are approaches that
address a host of land uses in a catchment area, their effects on soil properties and erosion, and the
hydrological regime, as well as biomass, energy and biodiversity issues. Upstream and downstream land
and water users and their mutual interactions are also included in this approach. A range of sustainable
production methodologies designed to enhance pro­ductivity as well as contribute to the protection and
enhancement of ecosystem services are also enshrined in the landscape approach. Examples of these
approaches include sustainable crop production intensification (FAO, 2010 a), organic agriculture (Sanduh
et al., 2009), conservation agriculture (Kassam et al., 2009), integrated crop-livestock management
(Russelle, 2007) and agroforestry (Jose, 2009). The centrepiece to the success of these methodologies
is an integrated landscape approach that takes into account the loaded mosaic of land uses, stakeholder
needs, common management practices and their interactions.
The EcoAgriculture Partners (2012) report categorises LA into key actions with three broad, core
components for operationalisation. It then lists 10 key principles that can be considered as a checklist for
the implementation and operationalisation of integrated landscape management. These three components
are: (a) landscape goal(s) encompassing multiple objectives at different scales; (b) adaptive planning
and management; and (c) collaborative action and comprehensive stakeholder involvement. These core
components are illustrated in Fig 5.1.
Some of the advantages of LA include the following:
••
it is not a “one-size-fits-all” approach but rather encompasses several sectors, stakeholders, social,
cultural and other conditions across geographical boundaries that broadly make ecological sense;
••
it requires that land-use planning and decision-making are considered differently with respect to
scale, taking into account spatial components;

63
••
it encourages a combination of bottom-up and top-down principles so as to encourage local
community participation; and
••
economies of scope and scale: land and water users in a landscape share their skills and assets with
a view to achieving economies of scale and cost advantages resulting from integrated production.

and other competing land uses.

5.5  Some governance issues in implementing LA
In order to mount a successful landscape approach, it is imperative to have sound governance structures,
since this determines the level of transparency through which resources are distributed. Furthermore,
good governance potentially minimises the chances of corruption or abuse of power creeping into the
operationalisation of the approach. Good governance also creates the enabling environment for coming
up with landscape programmes that are successful and sustainable over time. In this vein, relevant rules
and processes should be built into the formulation of resource management policies in a given locality.
In addition, these structures should also be flexible such that they are customised to local situations.
The following sections touch on some of the most important requirements when implementing the
landscape approach.
The landscape approach

64
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
5.5.1  Capacity-building in the landscape approach
To adopt a landscape approach, the participating stake­holders need to be fully informed about the
approach, as well as their rights and responsibilities within the landscape, so as to be able to participate
meaningfully in discussions pertaining to the land. Capacity-building with respect to landscape management
is vital at all levels in order to manage both natural and social systems holistically. Further training may
require stakeholders to take part in discussions and negotiations with respect to resource management,
learning new tools and methods for landscape management, new approaches for individual or community
land management, and technologies and methods for agricultural and forestry activities. Extension
services are often used for commu­nity capacity-building (FAO, 2012). Box 5.1 illustrates some of the
capacity-building requirements.
Box 5.1 The VI Agroforestry Western Kenya Carbon Project
Initiated in 2009, the VI Agroforestry Western Kenya Carbon Project works through a well-established
extension service covering 45,000 hectares and serving 60,000 farmers. These extension workers
collaborate with local community groups, facilitating the training and implementation of sustainable,
locally adapted agricultural land management techniques. The project works with local institutions,
building the capacities of local extensionists, field officers and farmers.
Source: Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project, 2011
5.5.2  Security of land tenure
Tenure security and its governance are central to sustainable landscape management. Long-term planning
is risky and untenable in an uncertain environment. This state of affairs encourages unsustainable land
and resource management, for example, indiscriminate cutting down of trees leading to deforestation.
Recognition of the tenure entitlements of all stakeholders in a given landscape enables them to arrive at
land-use planning decisions committing themselves to long-term adaptation and mitigation objectives.
Tenure-holders and resource-users should be involved in this process of participatory consultations
and entitlements.
5.5.3  Well integrated land-use planning
Participatory Integrated Land-use Planning (ILUP) has become the main tool for any (spatial) development
intervention whose objectives are social, ecological and economic sustainability. As a tool that is dedicated
to the interests of different user communities in a defined area, it plays a pivotal role in the landscape
approach. Sometimes there are circumstances in which the various interests of small-scale farmers,
herdsmen, mining companies, large-scale agricultural investors and the populations of villages and small
towns have to be amicably reconciled in a given landscape, while respecting spaces for recreation and
protected areas for nature and biodiversity. Land-use planning therefore actively involves the different
interest and user communities in finding compromises that permit sustainable development collaboratively.
5.5.4  Participation
To arrive at consensus decisions, it is essential to have a legitimate forum where negotiations can take
place and conflicts are resolved. All stakeholders should have fair representation in such a forum and be
given sufficient capacity to participate effectively. An adequate knowledge base, appropriate to the local
setting, is crucial to the landscape approach planning process. This should include an understanding of
the problems, needs and objectives of all stakeholders, namely the status and trends of land resources,

65
appropriate technologies for improved productivity and reduction of environmental impacts, institutional
and legal frameworks and economic and market conditions. The latest version of the FAO methodology
for agro-ecological zoning (FAO 2012 c) contains a comprehensive account of these various social and
environmental considerations.
5.6  Climate-smart agriculture and the landscape approach
Climate-smart agriculture is applicable at multiple levels. It covers practices and technologies at the field
and farm levels and involves working with communities over a much wider area, such as watersheds and
ecosystems (Figure 5.2). Although many examples of successful climate-smart practices exist, there is
still much work to be done to improve technologies, policies and insti­tutions to move from single objective
production to the implementation of different types of multiple objective systems. The breakthrough towards
a broad application of climate-smart natural resource management will require a paradigm shift in our
thinking about agricultural production and the related institutional structures that will make this transformation
a reality.

Among the different land uses in the landscape approach, there will be synergies and trade-offs. Some
serious efforts are required to manage the syner­gies and trade-offs between building the resilience of the
ecosystems and livelihoods and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Numerous experiences and best
practices that can contribute to reaching the objective of climate-smart agriculture already exist and are
discussed in other chapters of this Manual. These practices, which touch on synergies between mitigation
and adaptation, as well as supporting the multiple functions of agricultural systems and landscapes, should
be scaled up to the landscape level.
The landscape approach

66
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
By taking a landscape approach and applying climate-smart agriculture, one finds ways of increasing
mitigation and adaptation opportunities on community lands as well as the entire ecosystem, while at the
same time sustainably increasing and intensifying productivity. Below is a list of activities that can help in
this regard:
••
The conservation and regeneration of trees and the restoration of degraded forests also in­creases
carbon stocks and may, in addition reduce the pressure on adjacent natural forests and ecosystems,
resulting in a decline in emissions. Increasing the diversity of trees allows more overall biodiversity
in the landscape, as well as creating favourable moisture conditions. This contributes to the
regeneration of soil nutrients, which makes the forest more resilient.
••
Trees on farms or agroforestry systems can contribute to mitigating climate change, as they tend
to sequester greater carbon quantities than agricultural systems alone. Trees have other important
functions, such as providing shade for crops, erosion control and nutrient cy­cling. They also act
as buffers against storms, and hence protect crops. By providing a means to diversify incomes,
trees provide a type of insurance in the event of crop failures, since they can provide an alternative
income.
••
The holistic management of grassland ecosystems and controlled grazing allows for the regeneration
of degraded vegetation and soils. This, in turn, creates an opportunity to seques­ter carbon in the
soil, as well as increasing biomass and biodiversity through perennial grasses, shrubs and trees.
Well-managed grasslands provide other important benefits, such as increased water infiltration and
retention and improved nutrient cycling.
••
At the farm level, there are opportunities to increase productivity and carbon sequestration through
conservation agriculture. Conservation agriculture combines minimum tillage with crop rotation and
covers crops or mulch. This enhances biomass by integrating trees and shrubs in and around the
fields. Conservation agriculture also increases tolerance to changes in soil temperature and rainfall
associated with extreme climate events such as droughts or flooding.
5.7  Barriers to the landscape approach
Even though there is a strong potential for synergies between adaptation and mitigation benefits, several
barriers stand in the way of adoption of climate-smart landscapes:
••
Policy and institutional hurdles hinder the integration of adaptation and mitigation within the landscape
approach. Policies that support conventional agriculture (fossil fuel-intensive) are generally more
favourably considered than those that support sustainable and climate-smart practices (Mattison
and Norris, 2005). Furthermore, development policy is usually short-term (usually five to ten years),
whereas the results of the landscape approach require longer-term planning.
••
Institutional barriers usually hinder the addressing of complexities at the landscape level. Usually,
landscapes and the interactions between stakeholders and different land uses is complex. In most
cases, there are no simple solutions to complex challenges, and a “one-size-fits-all” approach does
not apply. This situation, therefore calls for a careful assessment of location-specific challenges, as
well as a learning-by-doing approach. Furthermore, ways need to be found that take into account the
sector-specific mandates of different ministries to resolve the challenges of working across sectors.
••
Socio-economic factors in developing countries usually limit the implementation of climate-smart
agriculture even in cases where funding is available and the policy is appropriate. In such cases,
poverty, cultural factors, education, access to markets and credit, institutional capacity and a lack
of land tenure are known to affect the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices and farmer
decisions regarding land use (McCarthy et al; 2011).
••
Lack of knowledge and awareness of integrated landscape management at the levels of national and
local governments, the private sector and civil-society actors is a serious obstacle to the adoption
of a landscape approach. Landscape level ideas take time to filter down to more national and local

67
actors. Furthermore, many integrated landscape management programmes lack strong monitoring
and evaluation components, especially beyond household and community scales, thus making the
assessment of landscape-level benefits difficult
••
Separate and uncoordinated funding for mitigation and adaptation also pose a constraint on adoption
of the landscape approach. Mitigation activities are usually funded by the private sector and carbon
finance, whereas adaptation measures are likely to be supported by public funds, NGOs and donors
who are interested in poverty alleviation, food security or disaster relief (Schallatek et al., 2012).
5.8  Suggested solutions
While the barriers to the landscape approach are considerable, they could be removed through a
combination of targeted scientific research, policy and institutional reforms, and the required changes
in finding modalities and sources. One area that needs improvement in the adoption of climate-smart
landscapes is exploiting scientific evidence and the necessary technical guidance to achieve the best
options for agricultural systems and landscapes (Scherr et al., 2012).
With respect to policy and institutions, it is necessary to have a high level of commitment to support
conservation agriculture, agroforestry and other climate-smart practices; to promote multi-stakeholder
planning across local, regional, national and business interests; to raise the awareness of policymakers
and other decision-makers about agriculture and landscapes; to promote landscape governance and
resource tenure reforms that facilitate and incentivise planning for landscape management; and to promote
local institutions and extension services and clarify agriculture's role in the context of REDD+.
With regard to funding, development is needed of more diverse funding opportunities such as payments
for ecosystem services, as well as philanthropic investments, government and private funding to support
climate-smart agriculture and integrated landscapes. There is a need to ensure that carbon finance
initiatives promote the adoption of best practices that integrate mitigation and adaptation goals. There
is also a need to promote strategies that include adaptation as a precondition for obtaining carbon
finance for mitigation projects (for instance the UN’s REDD+ and the private sector) and vice versa for
adaptation projects.
In the area of socio-economics, there is a need to promote national-level policy and institutional changes
to ensure that farmers have the resources and technical capacity to adopt climate-smart agricultural
practices. Finally donors should also be encouraged to support local efforts aimed at integrating adaptation
and mitigation activities.
5.9  Conclusions
By promoting the sustainable management of the natural resource base, preserving and in­creasing
ecosystem services, and building resilience to shocks and disturbances, the landscape ap­proach can
greatly support the needs of diverse stakeholder groups. However, the successful im­plementation of this
approach requires strong governance and participatory mechanisms involving all stakeholders. It also
demands a multidisciplinary understanding of the environmental, social and economic dynamics within
the landscape. In particular, considerable work needs to be done to understand the drivers and agents of
agricultural expansion and deforestation so that appro­priate policy and finance interventions can be included.
This is particularly important in tropical countries where deforestation, driven by a number of factors, is
causing widespread land degrada­tion, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating the
loss of biodiversity. Country- and location-specific cross-sectoral policies targeted financing mechanisms
(including REDD+) and governance and regulatory infra­structures need to be devised to reduce the
drivers of deforestation, to safeguard forests from agricul­tural encroachment and to reconcile the diverse
sustainable land-use objectives in landscapes in better ways.
The landscape approach

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
The need for a transition to climate-resilient, low-greenhouse gas emitting production systems involves
all the land manage­ment systems in a given landscape. Climate-smart agricultural measures and policies
have to be seen as key components of local, national, and regional climate change strategies. It is important
to recognise the multiple dimensions and purposes of natural resource use and management, and the
inter­actions between human land-use, management practices and natural resources. This requires greater
consistency across all land-use sectors where the implementation of climate-smart agriculture should play
a critical role.

Zimbabwe
Abstract
This chapter addresses how soil and water management practices can contribute to the three pillars
of climate-smart agriculture in Zimbabwe. On water, the chapter will look at strategies, such as more
efficient irrigation and drainage, and in-situ moisture conservation and water harvesting practices that
are applicable under different climatic and scale conditions. On soil, the chapter addresses the problem
of soil degradation by discussing strategies to control soil erosion, nutrient management, reduced tillage,
mulching, residue management and carbon sequestration. The chapter draws on previous efforts at
sustainable intensification, particularly conservation agriculture. The purpose of this chapter is to provide
a basis for the end-users of the Manual to view soil and water management through climate-smart lenses
and adopt site-specific solutions.

6.1  Introduction
6.1.1  Background
Stakeholders in agriculture will be required to revise the way in which land, water and soil nutrients
are managed to ensure that these resources are used more efficiently to achieve the three pillars of
climate-smart agriculture (FAO, 2013). CSA is an extension of previous sustainable intensification
efforts summarised in Pretty et al., (2011) which include crop improvements, agroforestry, soil and water
conservation, conservation agriculture, integrated pest management, horticulture, livestock and fodder
crops and aquaculture, as well as novel policies and partnerships.
A large proportion of communal lands in Zimbabwe are semi-arid, rainfall being a limiting factor in crop
production. In addition to the introduction of drought-tolerant crops and modern soil nutrient management,
two types of cultural practice have been adopted to stabilise yields, namely in-field and external water-
harvesting techniques (Mugabe, 2004). More recent studies have also emphasised the importance of
integrating nutrient and water management practices in semi-arid areas where moisture stress is frequent
(Nyamangara and Nyagumbo, 2010).
In addition to frequent droughts and high levels of climate variability, Zimbabwe will also be affected by
climate change. On average, temperatures and reference evapotranspiration in Zimbabwe were projected
to increase, while rainfall was predicted to decrease in the future (Nkomozepi and Chung, 2012). For
agricultural production systems to remain productive and have less variability and greater stability in
their outputs, they have to be resilient. Resilience is the capacity to adapt to changes and disturbances,
and at the same time, maintain core functions. The strategies that have been found to build resilience in
agriculture include sustainable soil and water management, biodiversity promotion and the diversification
of sources of income (FAO, 2013).
It is widely accepted that climate change is largely anthropogenic and is mostly caused by the emission of
greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosols and chemically active gases (Moss et al., 2010). In addition to fossil
fuels, another recognised anthropogenic source of atmospheric increase in GHG concentrations is land-
use change and other agricultural activities (Lal, 2001). Agriculture contributes to climate change mainly
through releases of methane from rice cultivation and enteric fermentation and of nitrous oxide from fertiliser
application. Additionally, agriculture exacerbates climate change through carbon dioxide (CO2) releases
associated with deforestation and burning. To reduce the contribution of agriculture to climate change,
farmers have to shift to practices such as more appropriate application of fertilisers, less soil disturbance
and better irrigation techniques, etc. Additionally, researchers have advised farmers to promote carbon
sequestration, i.e., the natural and deliberate processes by which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere
or diverted from emission sources and stored in the ocean, terrestrial environments (vegetation, soils and
sediments) and geological formations.
It is against this background that this chapter will attempt to identify agricultural soil and water management
practices suitable for Zimbabwe.
6.1.2  What is new in climate-smart agriculture?
CSA is a relatively new approach in Zimbabwe. The most fundamental difference from previously introduced
approaches is that CSA is not particularly prescriptive about practices or technologies; rather, its focus is
on attaining the three CSA pillars mentioned earlier. In other words, CSA requires spatio-temporal-specific
agricultural production technologies and practices that are beneficial in light of the three pillars. On the other
hand, CSA largely draws on previous sustainable intensification efforts in agriculture. CSA practitioners will
benefit from existing practices, policies and institutions in Zimbabwe. In this chapter, CSA will be treated as
Soil and water management in climate-smart agriculture in Zimbabwe

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
the adoption of existing agricultural practices (“good management practices”) that have been documented
to improve agriculture through various indicators, e.g., increased water use efficiency, increased drought
resilience, improved soil structure and fertility, reductions in nutrient losses, etc.
6.1.3  Climate-smart agriculture indicators
In Zimbabwe, research on indicators to be used to assess practices and technologies in CSA is still in its infancy.
A recent international report has published the indicators summarised in Table 6.1. In the report, the first, second
and third pillars of CSA are classified into the themes of productivity, resilience and mitigation respectively.

In a study in Kenya and Tanzania, fewer indicators (shown in Table 6.2) are used to analyse, quantify and
assess the effectiveness of agricultural practices and technologies. The indicators in the table are the
general guidelines used to identify the appropriate soil and water management practises for CSA. In the
near future, Zimbabwean researchers should look into developing tools that can be used to identify the
most appropriate CSA technologies, as has been done for Tanzania and Uganda (Mwongera et al., 2017).

6.2  Water management
6.2.1  Irrigation
Access to irrigation provides the means to cultivate an additional crop and is one of the most effective
strategies to boost the productivity of small-scale, dry-land farming systems (Maisiri et al., 2005).
Especially in the face of climate change, irrigation will be required to counter the predicted increase in
evapotranspiration rates and decreases in rainfall in the future (Nkomozepi and Chung, 2012). According to
Aquastat (http://www.fao.org/nr/aquastat), of the 4,100,000 ha that were cultivated in 2012/3, only 173,500
ha (ca 4% of the cultivated area) were under irrigation. In addition, the areas under surface, sprinkler and
localised irrigation were 46,850 ha, 112,800 ha and 13,880 ha respectively. Surface and sprinkler irrigation
methods are utilised in more than 90% of Zimbabwe’s irrigated lands, despite the low field-level application
efficiency of between 40% and 60%. In CSA, however, farmers are encouraged to use localised irrigation
methods (e.g., drip or subsurface irrigation) that have higher field-level application efficiencies of 70% to
90% as surface runoff and deep percolation losses are minimised. Resources permitting, farmers could
also use hydro-culture technologies, e.g., hydroponics with very high water-use efficiencies.
A relatively complex technology such as drip irrigation should not be part of short-term relief programmes,
but should instead be embedded in long-term developmental programmes to ensure that appropriate
technical support is provided in terms of crop management and the development of supply chains for
spare parts and additional kits (Belder et al., 2007; Moyo et al., 2006). Renewable energy pumps (e.g.,
solar-powered pumps) are preferable because they neither use fossil resources nor emit greenhouse
gases. Photovoltaic or solar-powered drip-irrigation systems combine the efficiency of drip irrigation with
the reliability of a solar-powered water pump. Furthermore, they save labour in rural off-grid areas where
hauling of water is traditionally done by hand by women and young girls (Burney et al., 2010).
In an environment of limiting resources, farmers can increase the efficiencies of existing surface and
sprinkler irrigation systems by reducing conveyance losses (e.g., maintenance and rehabilitation of canals),
appropriate irrigation scheduling and management decisions (e.g., supplementary, full or deficit irrigation).
In addition to improving the efficiency of irrigation facilities, strategies such as rain-water harvesting will be
beneficial in augmenting already burdened water sources.
6.2.2  Water harvesting
Rainwater harvesting is a technology used for collecting and storing rainwater. There are three methods of
rainwater harvesting: (i) in situ rainwater harvesting, collecting the rainfall on the surface where it falls and
storing it in the soil; (ii) external water harvesting, collecting run-off from rainfall over a surface (e.g., rock
surface) and storing it elsewhere; and (iii) domestic rainwater harvesting, where water is collected from
roof, street and courtyard runoffs (Helmreich and Horn, 2010). In the case of external water harvesting,
permission might be needed from parties with water rights in the catchment area. Domestic rainwater
harvesting is beneficial and may reduce water withdrawals for domestic water use at farms.
6.2.3  In-situ water-harvesting techniques
In-situ rainwater harvesting refers to the method of diverting, inducing, collecting, storing and conserving
local surface runoff for agricultural production (Motsi et al., 2004). A review of the pertinent literature
showed that researchers in Zimbabwe have focused on options that (i) prolong periods of soil moisture
availability, e.g.,  tied-ridges, no-till-tied-ridges, off-season weeding, winter tillage, contour planting and
mulching; and (ii) promote the infiltration of water into the soil, e.g.,  potholing, retention of crop residues,
ridging/furrowing, terracing, trash lines, vegetative barriers, stone lines and planting basins (Mupangwa et
al., 2006; Marongwe et al., 2011; Vogel, 1993). Such technologies increase the time available for infiltration
and increase surface storage. Most importantly, farmers are recommended to adopt sustainable techniques
that have been evaluated for their soil types and rainfall conditions (Motsi et al., 2004).
Soil and water management in climate-smart agriculture in Zimbabwe

76
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
The results of recent studies indicate that the use of fertilisers and soil and water conservation (tied ridges
and mulching) are indispensable for increasing agricultural productivity, particularly in high-risk, semi-arid
areas (Ngugi et al., 2014; TerAverst et al., 2015).
6.2.4  External water harvesting
In Zimbabwe, the surface and ground water resources on which most farmers depend are facing the
challenges of unpredictability of seasonal rainfall, high losses from evaporation, low conversion of rainfall
to runoff and sedimentation in reservoirs (Chitata et al., 2014). For example, the Katoto Reservoir in Mutoko
may be completely filled with sediment within less than 120 to 160 years, taking into account population
growth and climate change (Patton, 2015). In another study, the Malilangwe reservoir was predicted to lose
at least 16% of its storage capacity over the next 100 years at current levels of sedimentation (Dalu et al.,
2013). Sedimentation reduces the reservoir’s water-holding capacity, hence the yield is reduced both in
quantity and reliability, thereby reducing farmers’ resilience. Water harvesting is often cited as a feasible
option for increasing the resilience of agriculture in Zimbabwe.
External water harvesting can be categorised into micro-catchment and macro-catchment water harvesting,
and also includes flood and groundwater harvesting. Micro-catchment water harvesting involves collecting
runoff from a small drainage area and storing it, for example, in the root zone of an adjacent infiltration
basin planted with trees, bushes or annual crops. Macro-catchment water harvesting takes place on a
larger scale and involves capturing rock water or runoff from hill-slope catchments (Prinz and Singh, 2000).
Subsurface water harvesting can be used to take advantage of the water stored in the pores of the large
silt deposits in river courses and silted dams in Zimbabwe. Sub-surface water harvesting uses barrages
and cut-off walls, and has the advantages of not submerging land to store water and not involving the risk
of breaching disasters (Ishida et al., 2003). Barrages are structures capable of blocking the subsurface
flow (e.g., across a silted seasonal river channel) and hence retain the water in the local aquifer or divert
it to an adjacent aquifer giving larger and easier access to water resources. Barrages are divided into two
different types: underground barrages and surface barrages, where both types consist of a main structure
that will eventually be located below the ground surface (Forzieri et al., 2008). Barrages can be constructed
from stone, concrete or compacted earth. Water can be drawn from subsurface reservoirs through scoop
holes, wells or outlet pipes with taps.
The Dabane Trust advocates the construction of sand dams in Zimbabwe and has played a role in the
construction of over 150 sand abstraction water points in Gwanda along the Umzingwane, Thuli and Thepe
rivers. Other sand abstraction systems have been built in Nkayi, Tsholotsho, Mangwe, Bulilima, Masvingo,
Chivhu, Gokwe and Guruve. The greater success of sub-surface reservoirs is evident in Japan, where the
Miyakojima subsurface dams store over 20,000,000 m3 of groundwater, of which 50,000 m3 of water is
drawn daily through 147 tube wells (Ishida et al., 2003). The three CSA principles for the water sector are
illustrated in Figure 6.1.
Case study 6.1 on Rain Water Harvesting: The Story of Zephaniah Phiri Maseko
When Mr Zephaniah Maseko Phiri lost his job at Rhodesia Railways, his concern was how he would
care for his family. Coming to settle in the arid Zvishavane District, Mr Phiri built his homestead in
an area which was dominated by extensive granite outcrops all around. Soon he discovered that he
had built his homestead directly in the path of raging waters (runoff) running down the slopes of the
granite outcrops after rain storms. To solve this problem Mr Phiri started working on a plan to divert
the rainwater away from his homestead. He experimented with contours, sand traps and stone bands
on the slopes to prevent erosion by redirecting rainwater away from his homestead. With time he built
underground reservoirs with a system of pipes and contours to collect rainwater from the slopes. The
effect of recharge from harvested water was soon apparent on the fruit trees on his homestead. He

77
then realised that he could apply the same concept to harvest water in his fields, retaining moisture for
long periods after rains. Instead of open contours that channel water away from crop fields, Mr Phiri
dug infiltration pits within the contours which he called “Phiri pits”. These would collect runoff water in
contours and allow it to infiltrate, only channelling it out once the pits were filled. Thereafter a number
of researchers have conducted hydrological experiments to authenticate the positive effects of in-situ
rainwater harvesting. An intricate network of deepened contours and carefully managed water ways from
the outcrops consistently fed Mr Phiri’s fields with moisture throughout the year, while diverting excess
water into two large fish ponds, creating a thriving micro-climate surrounded by flourishing fruit trees
teeming with birdlife. The concept of “Phiri pits” in contours soon became a world phenomenon for in-situ
water harvesting. Mr Phiri won numerous awards and was invited to speak at several conferences and
gatherings before he passed away in 2015. An NGO called Zvishavane Water Project was formed in
his honour to promote his teachings and his legacy. Many farmers in the district have since adopted Mr
Phiri’s teachings and are practising his concepts in their own fields. The results have been phenomenal,
enabling farmers to go beyond food security and investing in other family needs such as educating
children. Mr Phiri’s legacy lives on, well beyond his own village and humble beginnings. Most importantly,
Mr Phiri’s hard work remains his family’s weapon against droughts and mid-season dry spells.
Figure 6.1 Schematic illustration of CSA in the water sector
Can rain water harvesting work across the country?
The benefits of water harvesting are now beyond debate. Whether in supporting better in-field moisture
retention, water for livestock and household use - the practice increases water use efficiency. With
declining water resources as one of the most disconcerting impacts of climate change, competences
in managing water resources are top on the priority lists of prerequisites for transition to climate-smart
agriculture. Many farmers are already investing in different forms of water harvesting techniques. The
potential is huge. We are only starting to tap into this precious resource. Imparting the skills that farmers
need to analyse their circumstances and invest appropriately into water harvesting techniques needs
to be top among the support provided by the government and non-governmental practitioners. Farmer
information exchanges, and documentation and sharing of success stories will go a long way in exposing
farmers to the depth and breadth of opportunities in their own circumstances.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
6.3  Soil management
6.3.1  Introduction
Unsustainable practices, such as continuous cropping with reductions in fallow and rotations; repetitive tillage
and soil nutrient mining; overstocking, overgrazing and burning of rangelands; and the overexploitation or
clearance of wooded and forest lands cause land degradation (FAO, 2013). In the light of soil and water
management, land degradation is caused by soil erosion and nutrient mining. Soil erosion is a multi-stage
process involving the detachment, redistribution and deposition of soil in depressions and finally in aquatic
ecosystems (Lal, 2001). Nutrient mining refers to a process whereby soil nutrient reserves are depleted
because of continued uptake without adequate replenishment. Burning for land clearing, the burning of
crop residues and veld fires should be avoided by all means.
6.3.2  Management practices
6.3.2.1  Soil conservation/erosion control
In this chapter, “Indigenous Soil Conservation” is advocated, being defined as a set of soil conservation
strategies that evolve from a knowledge base accumulated by local people by observation and
experimentation to preserve the soil. The practices that are promoted include those that decrease the
erodibility of runoff and of the soil. Contour ridges and storm-water drains should be established, rehabilitated
or maintained, depending on the area. In addition to the in-field conservation strategies introduced above,
off-field practices are beneficial in catchments and reduce erosion, siltation and sedimentation. The
practices should reduce wind, rain and sleet, as well as gully and fluvial erosion. Some of the methods
used in Zimbabwe include gabion blocks, establishing vegetation on bare steep slopes etc.
6.3.2.2  Reduced tillage
Tillage disturbance is the dominant factor that reduces carbon stabilisation in clayey soil, probably by
reducing carbon stabilisation within micro-aggregates and thus leading to rapid soil organic matter
decomposition (Chivenge et al., (2007). The following four minimum tillage practices that were adopted
from Nyagumbo (1999) and are being advocated in addition to zero tillage in this chapter are shown below.
(i) 	 No till tied ridging. This practice consists of semi-permanent ridges with cross-ties along the
furrows to trap runoff. Normally once constructed, the ridges should not be destroyed for a period of
six seasons depending on the crop rotations practiced. In wet areas, planting is done on top of the
ridges, while planting may also be carried out in the furrows in drier areas.
(ii) 	Mulch-ripping. This practice involves the retention of crop residues on the surface and the use of a
ripper to open up planting lines.
(iii) 	Clean ripping. This system is similar to mulch-ripping, except that no crop residues are retained
after harvesting.
(iv) 	Planting basins. These involve the use of hoes to open up planting holes. The basins should be
15 cm x 15 cm and about 15 cm deep in rows 75–90cm apart with 50–60 cm between the basins
in the rows, leaving about 90% of the soil area undisturbed (Zimbabwe Conservation Agriculture
Taskforce, 2009).
The justification given by farmers for the continued use of conventional tillage practices like repeated
ploughing is to improve infiltration, minimise runoff and prepare seed-beds. Furthermore, the negative
effects of a lack of tillage have been recorded in some clay-poor, structurally weak soils of the arid and
semi-arid areas that are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies of the region have
found that some soil and water management techniques such as minimum soil disturbance and crop
rotation had no significant impact on crop yields (Arslan et al., 2015). The key is to suit the practice to

79
conditions such as soil, crop, climate conditions etc. For example, a study from the early 1990s established
that the no-till tied ridging technique resulted in the highest grain yield in the sub-humid region, while the
mulch-ripping technique was superior in the semi-arid region (Vogel, 1993).
The choice of practice adopted depends on the quality of natural resources (soil type, topography etc.), the
household resource level (particularly income levels and labour availability) and crop type and intensity,
as well as socio-economic and gender issues. Under the CIMMYT project titled “Facilitating the adoption
of conservation agriculture in Eastern and Southern Africa”, manual and animal traction seeding systems
were promoted to reduce the demand for labour. A manual implement, the jab-planter (matracas) can
go through the mulch and release seed and fertiliser in moist soil. The animal traction systems included
planting behind the “Magoye ripper”, with ripper tines attached to a plough frame. Finally, there was also
an animal traction direct seeder with a coulter that cut through the residues and a ripper tine that opened
a furrow, together with seed and fertiliser being placed in the furrow. Currently, low-cost mechanised
implements that can be used in communal agriculture are being developed by various manufacturers and
researchers, including the Korean Programmes in International Agriculture (KOPIA) Centre, based at the
SIRDC research facilities in Harare.
Minimum tillage, when coupled with permanent soil cover with crop residues or growing plants and
crop rotation, has the potential to increase water productivity and thereby reduce the risk of crop failure
(Thierfelder and Wall, 2009).
6.3.2.3  Mulching and residue management
Mulching and residue management can be defined as a technology whereby, at the time of crop emergence,
at least 30% of the soil surface is covered by organic residues from the previous crop (Erenstein, 2002).
Crop residues are utilised for soil and water conservation, as well as for soil organic inputs and livestock
feed, and are critical in smallholders building and maintaining soil nutrient stocks. Of the soils surveyed in
a sample area in Zimbabwe, 77% were deficient in nitrogen, 85% in phosphorus and 55% in potassium.
The potential nitrogen and phosphorus losses through the removal of maize stover from fields were found
to be 44% and 42% of the total uptakes respectively (Mapfumo and Mtambanengwe, 1999). Mulching
therefore offers opportunities to address soil fertility and weed management constraints (Ereinstein, 2003).
Mulching improves infiltration, and the soil cover provides effective protection against rain splash erosion
and surface runoff.
An analysis of maize yields and conservation agriculture practices indicated that yields were equal or
improved in comparison to conventional production systems in “normal” or dry years, but tended to be
depressed during seasons with above-average rainfall. The improved water use under conservation
agriculture in “normal” or dry years is largely due to the presence of a mulch of crop residues, whereas the
absence of tillage in itself can result in the opposite effect of higher runoff and lower levels of infiltration,
leading to lower yields (Giller et al., 2009). Furthermore, mulching only tends to be viable when property
rights to residual crop biomass are observed and tenure is secure (Erenstein, 2003). In Mozambique,
however, a study observed that the mulch is often removed in a matter of weeks by termites, thus reducing
the benefits of mulching (Giller et al., 2009). In a separate study, the role of termites is discussed with
reference to soil processes, vegetation cover, atmospheric gas exchanges and agricultural intensification
(Black and Okwakol, 1997). The potential of mulching depends on the opportunity costs of retaining
the mulch and of subsequent changes, e.g., the need for mulch-adapted seeders or extra labour, and
alternative weed, pest and disease management practices.
Example of a trade-off between crop residue retention and utilisation as feed
The results of a farm-scale study in Mbiri District determined that the optimum fraction of crop residue to be
retained in the fields for maximum farm crop production varied for farmers with two or less head of cattle
Soil and water management in climate-smart agriculture in Zimbabwe

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
(80% retention), with two to three head (60–80%) and with four or more heads (40–60%). Farmers with no
livestock attained maximum crop production when 100% of their sorghum residues remained in the field,
as they do not have access to cattle manure. At the scale of the entire territory, total cotton and sorghum
production increased with the density of cattle, at the expense of soil mulching with crop residues.
The study highlights the important role of animal traction and manure in smallholder agriculture and shows
that, as farm sizes increase, a larger percentage of residues may be removed (Baudron et al., 2015).
Another study showed that there are no significant yield benefits derived from increasing mulch cover
beyond 4 t ha−1 or around 40% (Mupangwa et al., 2012).
6.3.2.4  Nutrient management
The excessive nutrient mining of the soil in Zimbabwe needs to be addressed by soil fertility/nutrient
management systems that take the strong crop-livestock interactions into consideration (Mapfumo and
Mtambanengwe, 1999; FAO, 2013). In their review, Mafongoya et al., (2006) presented five options for
nutrient management, namely inorganic fertilisers, grain legumes, animal manures, integrated nutrient
management and agroforestry options appropriate to smallholders. Inorganic fertilisers, particularly those
containing nitrogen, should be applied with effective nitrogen management. A study by Delgado et al.,
(2011) recommends the use of slow-release fertiliser, nitrification inhibitors, higher use efficiency, multiple
applications and application at lower rates in order to reduce losses of reactive nitrogen due to leaching
and runoff, as well as losses from volatilisation and mineralisation.
On legumes, self-nodulating promiscuous types of indeterminate soybean (Glycine max), pigeon pea
(Cajanus cajan), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), dolichos bean (Dolichos lablab), velvet bean (Mucuna
spp.), and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (Walp) L.) were found to be among the most promising species for
combined nutrient strategies in Malawi and Zimbabwe (Snapp et al., 1998). Similarly, a multi-country study
conducted among households in the region showed that fertiliser tree systems also have positive impacts
on crop yields and carbon sequestration (Ajayi et al., 2011). Fertiliser Tree Systems (FTS) involve the
planting or regeneration of fast-growing nitrogen-fixing trees or woody shrubs that produce high-quality leaf
biomass and are adapted to the local climatic and soil conditions. Over the years, different types of FTS
have been developed, including sequential fallows, semi-permanent tree- and crop-intercropping, annual
relay cropping and biomass transfer (Ajayi et al., 2011).
In addition to compost and animal manure, which is studied extensively in Zimbabwe, studies from abroad
present vermiculture—a technology of sustainable development through the use of earthworms in vermi-
composting, vermi-filtration, vermi-remediation and vermi-agroproduction (Sinha et al., 2010; Sinha et
al., 2014). Worms increase nitrogen levels in the soil by adding their metabolic and excretory products
(vermicast), mucus, body fluids, enzymes (auxins, gibberlins and cytokinins) and the decaying tissues of
dead worms. Overall, predicting nutrient contributions is critical in developing organic matter technologies
because high-quality organic inputs are low in lignin and polyphenol and high in nitrogen, while low-quality
materials are having the opposite characteristics (Snapp et al., 1998). Many crop residues and animal
manures are of low quality, as they fall below the critical nitrogen content of 1.8 to 2.0% and immobilise
nitrogen temporarily, thereby exacerbating the nutrient deficiency. A strategy used worldwide in intensified
cropping systems is to combine inputs of organic matter (mulch, compost, crop residues, green manure)
with fertilisers to address or prevent macro- and micro-nutrient deficiencies (FAO, 2013).
6.3.2.5  Carbon sequestration
In agriculture, crops and their relation to the carbon cycle are used to sequester carbon permanently in its
elemental or stable state within the soil. In addition to the retention of crop residues, the addition of manure
and minimum tillage that sequester carbon, various methods that have been suggested include:
i.
Cover and catch crops, e.g., grasses and weeds as temporary cover between planting seasons;

81
ii.
Concentrate livestock in small paddocks for days at a time so they graze lightly but evenly to
encourage roots to grow more deeply into the soil; and
iii.	 Restore degraded land, which slows carbon release, while returning the land to agriculture or other
use.
The high granite-derived sand content of the majority of soils in much of Zimbabwe and the limited
protection for carbon from oxidation have caused most soils to be low in organic carbon, whether cultivated
or uncultivated (Snapp et al., 1998). Furthermore, the redistribution of carbon transported with eroded
sediments affects several processes that accentuate emissions of greenhouse gases from the landscape
to the atmosphere (Lal, 2001). Therefore, soil conservation and erosion-control methods also promote
carbon sequestration. In this chapter, only sequestration strategies with direct benefits to yields, and
soil and water conservation are advocated. The establishment of deep-rooting and perennial plants will
facilitate carbon sequestration, and trees can be used for live fencing, windbreaks, fodder and as riparian
forest buffers, etc. Intercropping maize with deep-rooting species such as Faidherbia Albida can also be
beneficial in aiding carbon sequestration and improving productivity.
The adoption and success of the practices just mentioned will depend on technical, social, economic,
technological, farm-level and institutional considerations. The amalgamation of these issues will certainly
determine the feasibility of the various practices and the productivity/income and environmental (climate
change adaptation and mitigation) returns, and ultimately farmer acceptance.
6.4  Tools
6.4.1  Introduction
At this point, it is clear that stakeholders need an increasing amount of information to improve their
understanding of the possible outcomes of their choice of practices to help achieve the three CSA pillars.
In line with recent progress in the use of ICT in agriculture, ICT can also be used to reduce the time and
human resources required to analyse complex alternative options in soil and water management.
The use of modelling in agriculture can reduce the uncertainties generated by climate change, improve
early warning systems for drought, flood, pests and disease incidence, and thus increase the capacity of
farmers and agricultural planners to allocate resources effectively. There are a large number of models
that can be used to make decisions on the various issues that have been raised in this chapter, once they
have been calibrated and validated. The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and
Food Security (CCAFS) Mitigation Options Tool, for example, is easy to use and provide mitigation options,
taking into consideration the agricultural production system, climate, and soil information (Feliciano et al.,
2016). The Aquacrop and CROPWAT models, both developed by the FAO, are indispensable in analysing
soil and water management issues in CSA.
6.4.2  Aquacrop
The AquaCrop model has a structure that takes the various components of crop production into account,
including the soil and moisture balance; the plant, its development, growth and yield processes; and
the atmosphere, ambient temperatures, rainfall, irrigation, evaporative demand and carbon dioxide
concentration. Additionally, in some management aspects the soil-water balance, crop development and
crop yield are explicitly considered. The functional relationships between the different model components
are illustrated in Figure 6.2 and detailed descriptions can be found in Raes et al., (2011).

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Figure 6.2 The main components of AquaCrop (Raes et al., 2011)
Input parameters for the AquaCrop model include crop, soil, irrigation and cultural management. Soil
properties such as texture and rootable soil depth will have to be established through research.
6.4.3  CROPWAT
CROPWAT was designed for the calculation of crop water and irrigation requirements from soil, climate
and crop data, and has been appropriately used as a tool for testing the efficiency of different soil and water
management practices under climate change. The crop water requirements are calculated by multiplying the
reference evapotranspiration and appropriate crop coefficients (Kc). Kc is determined by the aerodynamic
roughness of the crop, general resistance within the crop canopy and soil to the flow of heat and water
vapour, and reflectance of the crop and soil surface to shortwave radiation. Irrigation requirements are
estimated from the difference between crop water requirements and effective rainfall (Allen et al., 1998).
6.5  Discussion and conclusion
6.5.1  Policy implications and incentive systems
The key requirements for an enabling policy environment to promote CSA transition is greater coherence,
coordination and integration between climate change, agricultural development and food-security policy
processes (FAO, 2010). As pointed out earlier in the chapter, the transition from conventional or other
approaches to climate-smart agriculture comes with challenges, e.g., the temporary immobilisation of
nitrogen, increases in the demand for labour in clearing land and weeding, procuring new tillage and

83
planting equipment, etc. Financial incentives are needed to make it possible for small-scale farmers to
adopt CSA and assistance to them is required to find ways to overcome other barriers to adopting climate-
smart practices, such as risk, lack of technical information or access to resources. Additionally, the cost-
benefit profile of CSA typically involves clear net benefits, but in the form of significant initial costs coupled
with gradually rising but stable benefit streams.
Some of the incentives include the Green Climate Fund, which may be accessed through the African
Development Bank (AfDB) and falls within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was founded as a mechanism to assist developing countries to adapt to
and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. The AfDB also administers the Africa Climate Change
Fund. Local companies such as Carbon Green Africa facilitate the generation of carbon credits and are
running successful forest conservation projects (carbon sequestration) in Mashonaland West. In addition,
smallholders adopt sustainable practices, e.g., soil and water conservation, when they have secure
land tenure.
a.	 Farmers need policies that remove hindrances in transitioning to climate-smart agriculture and that
create synergies with alternative technologies and practices. The following issues were raised in
this chapter and can be addressed by means of appropriate policies. According to the Water Act,
Chapter 20:24, the efficiency of the irrigation method is given priority in the application of permits.
Policymakers should further consider reducing the cost of more efficient irrigation systems through
the removal of import taxes and duties and granting loans and tax incentives to local manufacturers;
b.	 The need to consider how macro-water harvesting or rock-water harvesting can be incorporated into
legislation and not disadvantage the associated holders of water permits;
c.	 The need for policymakers to consider the underground reservoirs in areas of water shortage where
the Water Act prohibits the abstraction of water from boreholes and wells;
d.	 The need for policymakers to consider policies that promote the importation and manufacture of
minimum tillage equipment and slow-release fertilisers;
e. For farmers who wish to retain their stover/crop residues, policymakers may need to consider fines
for the owners of livestock that feed on their crop residues;
f.
There is a need for funding in research and simulation modelling to establish the potential of
numerous practices for the different environments in Zimbabwe; and
g.	 Policymakers will also need to consider policies for the capacity-building of stakeholders in agricultural
education, extension, research and technical services.
6.5.2  Concluding remarks
There are numerous soil and water management options available that are applicable to various site-
specific conditions in CSA. Stakeholders in agriculture will be required to revise the ways in which land,
water and soil nutrients are managed to ensure that these resources are used more efficiently in line with
the three pillars of CSA. The adoption and success of the practices mentioned in this chapter will depend
on various technical, social, economic, technological, farm-level and institutional considerations.

Abstract
This chapter introduces the challenges of crop production in Zimbabwe under the impact of the recent
droughts that are associated with climate change and variability, especially in natural regions IV and V.
The chapter then introduces climate-smart agriculture as a remedy for the climate change impacts in the
affected natural regions in Zimbabwe. The guiding principles and the essence of the three pillars of CSA are
described as sustainable agriculture production, climate resilience and mitigation. The chapter then gives
case studies of the natural regions exemplifying the three pillars. The case studies presented reflect on the
most relevant areas where CSA technologies are recommended in the different natural regions. The roles
of tertiary education and extension operations in popularising CSA concepts are also described, together
with existing Zimbabwean policies that are relevant to CSA. The conclusion discusses the strategies that
AGRITEX, as well colleges and tertiary institutions, could adopt in popularising CSA practices, which would
improve understanding of the short-to-long-term results of a CSA intervention.
Keywords: adaptation, climate change, climate-smart agriculture, mitigation, productivity, resilience, sustainable
Key messages
i.
Enabling stronger linkages between research and extension, and appreciating the value of
local innovations will remain key to the establishment and sustainability of a practical national
CSA programme;
ii.
Drought-tolerant and high-yielding crop varieties, together with crop diversification will play a pivotal
role in reducing the food-security risks associated with climate change;
iii. The identification and development of agricultural clusters and incentive schemes for climate-
resilient products will help accelerate the adoption of CSA innovations in Zimbabwe; and
iv.	 Incorporation of CSA into the curricula of institutions of higher learning will greatly improve farmers’
access to climate-resilient technologies and practices, knowledge and information.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
7.1  Introduction
General environmental impacts associated with projected climate change have been described in the
scene-setting introductory chapter. In this chapter on crop production, we restrict the discussion to climate
change impacts on the arable agriculture sector. Zimbabwe’s agriculture is under threat because it depends
on levels of rainfall that are projected to decrease (IPCC, 2014) under climate change. By 2050, climate
change impacts in Zimbabwe are likely to show a reduction in rainfall, changes in the onset and cessation of
the seasons, frequent mid-season droughts and uneven spatial distribution of rain in the country. Droughts
and floods in successive years, as well as temperature increases of between 1oC and 3oC, are likely to
dominate the seasons. This might also result in the expansion of Agro-ecological Zone (AEZ) V surface
area, as well as the shrinking of AEZ I (Mugabe et al., 2013).
At present, Zimbabwe’s AEZs have shifted drastically due to the devastating effects of climate change with
more lands becoming marginalised and less productive. Of the five AEZs (natural regions I-V), I, II and III
form the greater proportion of the agricultural base for the country as they have comparatively favourable
climatic conditions and sufficient rainfall for crop production. Regions IV and V are characterised by low
annual rainfall and have largely been reserved for livestock production. In a study conducted by Mugandani
et al., 2012, major shifts have occurred in the drought-prone Regions IV and V, which have become
drier and more marginalised than previously thought. Zimbabwe's economy is driven by agriculture and
the majority of the rural population depends on climate-affected natural resources for their livelihoods.
Moreover, about 80% of the rural population lives in Natural Regions III, IV and V. The success rate of rain-
fed agriculture in Natural Regions IV and V has been calculated to be in the order of one good harvest in
every four to five years (FAO, 2008). These data clearly indicate that Zimbabwe’s climatic conditions are
drifting towards relatively more arid conditions that are not favourable for arable agriculture. Despite these
changes, it is estimated that about 122,000 hectares (6%) of land devoted to agricultural use is irrigable,
leaving the rest to depend on rainfall. Table 7.1 shows the farming systems that predominate in AEZs I–V.
The impacts of these climate projections will affect crop yields. Specifically, wheat, maize and horticultural
growing areas will shift, coupled with declining yields. Maize, a staple food crop in Zimbabwe, will not
be spared these decreasing yields. The IPCC predicts yield losses of between 18% and 30% for maize
in southern Africa by 2050 (AR5, 2015). The Report also mentions that sorghum yields could similarly
decline. Areas that are suitable for maize cultivation are predicted to decrease by 2080. One study predicts
that the south and west of the country will become less suitable for sorghum and maize cultivation, while
the north, central and eastern areas will favour maize, sorghum and cotton (Muriwa et al., Brown et al.,
2012). Crops such as groundnuts, roundnuts and cassava may benefit from increased CO2 levels (IPCC,
2014). In addition, areas suitable for growing sorghum and cotton are likely to increase by 2080.
Despite the climate change related decline in food-crop yields mentioned above, there is great potential
to counter this by adopting climate-smart agriculture. This section will focus on how relevant interventions
can contribute considerably to CSA. These interventions are expected to increase productivity while
mitigating climate change risks through proven practical CSA techniques such as mulching, intercropping,
conservation agriculture, agro-forestry and integrated crop-livestock management. CSA also involves
innovative practices such as weather forecasting, early-warning systems and weather index-based
insurance. Furthermore, CSA aims at developing new technologies such as drought-tolerant or flood-
tolerant crops to meet the exigencies of the changing climate. In the Zimbabwe context, extension officers
train the farmers to use these techniques.

These practices will only come as part of a deliberate and appropriately tailored extension strategy to
improve the following:
••
Farmers’ access to climate-resilient technologies and practices, and knowledge as well as information
for increasing productivity;
••
Farmers’ capacities to develop and manage climate-smart cropping systems;
••
Farmers’ access to market information and assistance with income diversification; and
••
Farmers’ ability to organise themselves better for collective action.
7.2  Guiding concepts under CSA
The three pillars of climate-smart agriculture as defined in the introductory chapter will enhance sustainable
agriculture production and livelihood resilience, as well as sequestering greenhouse gas emissions from the
atmosphere. This also implies promoting the achievement of sustainable food security in Zimbabwe.  CSA
practices are aimed at achieving food security and broader development goals in the face of the climate
risks discussed in section 7.1. However, it ought to be borne in mind that the third pillar (mitigation) is only
desirable when it is a co-benefit of the first two pillars, namely increasing production and building resilience
to climate change. Furthermore, when applying CSA technologies and practices, careful planning is needed
so as to manage the trade-offs and synergies that arise from the three pillars (FAO, 2010).  This approach
may have a universal CSA application for sustainable crop production in general or different crops across
the entire country and farming levels, or it may be differentiated in accordance with the crop and/or agro-
ecological region.
Main concepts in this approach:
••
CSA technologies for sustained  resilience under constrained natural environments;
••
Germplasm technology, i.e., promoting the adoption and delivery of drought-tolerant crops, improved
high-yielding varieties;
••
Crop diversification, i.e., incentives for intercropping, mixed cropping and growing orphan crops; and
••
Knowledge-sharing and value-chain analysis.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
7.2.1 	 CSA concepts and tools for sustained productivity under constrained
natural environments
Increasing areas of Zimbabwe are becoming agriculturally marginalised due to climate change. This
results in declining optimal crop growth, leading to low yields or total crop failure. In this regard, the need
to execute extension practices and to customise the FAO-funded Farm Management Handbook, endorsed
by the government of Zimbabwe in 2011 (FAOSTAT, 2012), could not be emphasised more strongly. Since
droughts are frequent in Regions IV and V, farmers are not keen to use expensive chemical fertiliser, even
though the soils are inherently poor. Instead, for economic reasons, they would rather use organic fertilisers
for crop production. Crop rotation and general agronomy concepts still apply, but the adoption of CSA will
produce different perspectives—regarding changes in management practices, decision-making and choice
of enterprise combinations on the farm. Extension services will also assist in enhancing awareness and the
deployment of relevant concepts by farmers.
The following CSA practices are to be encouraged, especially in severe drought-prone areas of Regions
IV and V:
••
Conservation agriculture, i.e., mulching, dry planting, no-tillage and minimum tillage, crop rotations,
green-manure cover crops and broad-bed furrows that  preserve moisture and aid in nutrient
recycling;
••
Early dry planting of short-season varieties of maize, as well as increasing planting depth to maximise
the use of every drop of water received;
••
Beneficial crop combinations and succession planting in areas like Chiredzi and Muzarabani, making
it possible to establish an irrigated winter crop, given that temperatures are conducive for crop
production during the dry winter months;
••
Promotion of small-grain, short-season and drought-tolerant crops such as sorghum and millets
which are micro-nutrient rich and do not deplete the soil of many of its nutrients;
••
Promotion of short-season varieties that can escape drought and make efficient use of the available
soil moisture;
••
Rainwater harvesting techniques, both infield and off field, groundwater recharge and seasonal
water-body retention; and
••
Higher efficiency irrigation systems, e.g., drip irrigation that ensures that water application is targeted
to meet the requirements at different growth stages.
7.2.2  Germplasm technology
The introduction and adoption of new germplasm to produce a significant yield in areas usually associated
with total crop failure is now being encouraged, having become an integral part of adaptation to climate
change. Conventional plant breeding for drought tolerance, pest and  disease resistance  has seen an
increase in the availability of better hybrids to farmers. This has become important since the risk of
drought is projected to increase in many regions, and the prevalence and severity of outbreaks of pest
and disease will also change with the changing climate (FAO, 2008). CIMMYT and International Institute of
Tropical Agriculture (IITA)’s Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa (DTMA) initiative is a good example of crop
interventions that can substantially reduce the risk of yield reductions or crop failure through breeding for
greater drought tolerance, while early-maturity varieties can be used for “terminal” drought escape. Through
the DTMA project, more than 160 maize varieties were released between 2007 and 2013 (CIMMYT, 2013).
The Zimbabwe Agricultural National Research Programme has helped in the dissemination of these
hybrids to smallholders.

91
7.3  Crop diversification
Crop diversification can improve resilience in a variety of ways, such as engendering the ability to suppress
pest outbreaks, dampening pathogen transmission, buffering crop production from the effects of greater
climate variability and extreme events, and increasing household incomes.
In Zimbabwe there has not been much diversification away from maize as the dominant source of food
security. The government has recognised this gap and is promoting other crops with better drought
tolerance as well as cash crops like cotton. Due to recurrent droughts during recent decades it has become
relatively difficult for farmers to rely on maize as the major source of food security. Consequently there
is a need to diversify the country’s food-security base by encouraging farmers to grow small-grain crops
such as sorghum and millet which can tolerate drought conditions (Fig. 7.1). Leguminous cover crops and
grasses like Rhodes grass (Katambora grass) can significantly improve the soil structure and consequently
farm incomes through savings in inputs.
Figure 7.1  Seeds for drought tolerant small grain crops at a climate-smart village in Gokwe
A good example is sorghum production in Zimbabwe. The crop has excellent drought tolerance and
multiple end-uses, including food and use in beer brewing, though production is still limited in the rural
areas. The government has set purchase prices for millets and sorghum equal to maize in a bid to
promote the production of these crops. The other example is cotton, a major source of income for rural
communities in AEZ 1V and AEZ V areas. At its peak, cotton accounts for close to a fifth of Zimbabwe's
agricultural exports.
Crop production

92
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
7.3.1  Knowledge-sharing
A good understanding of the whole value chain from production to market will definitely move agriculture
beyond being just a means for improving food security to becoming a tool of economic empowerment.
Incorporation of the Food and Agriculture theme for the Zimbabwe National Climate Change Response
Strategy into the curricula of colleges should help in the construction of a robust agro-advisory system.
AGRITEX monitors drought through crop water requirements and temperature, soil quality, evapotranspiration
and rainfall, which are recorded by the Meteorological Services Department (MSD). Extension workers can
also promote early maturing varieties by demonstrating their importance on farmers’ fields in mother-baby
demonstration plots. The Manual can also be written in Shona and Ndebele for the use of smallholders in
rural areas. Including the private and public sectors and the donor community in inputs, supply, production,
and business support services is necessary to leverage innovations.
7.4  Crop production and the three pillars of CSA
7.4.1  Essence of the three CSA pillars
As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, CSA entails enhancing farm production systems to:
••
sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes;
••
strengthen resilience in agriculture (climate change adaptation); and
••
reduce agriculture’s contribution to climate change (climate change ‘mitigation’, i.e., minimising
greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and/or acting as a sink of greenhouses gases in the
atmosphere).
As opposed to classical farming systems, CSA planning and sustainable agricultural systems come into
play, thereby integrating multiple goals and associated trade-offs into actual practice. In most cases, it is
not possible to achieve all three pillars in the CSA definition, therefore synergies and trade-offs need to
be identified and then the costs and benefits of different options balanced out depending on stakeholder
interests (Vermeulen et al., 2012). For example, commercial systems should focus on energy efficiency,
thereby reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, including other possible negative environmental impacts.
However, transforming smallholder farming systems to achieve sustainable food security is paramount.
Crop productivity can be increased through the adoption of higher yielding crop varieties, the appropriate
application of fertilisers and choosing crop species that have higher yield potentials under the given
environmental conditions: for example, choosing sorghum over maize in the drier AEZs IV and V.
7.4.2  Adaptation through climate risk management
Installing weather stations, rain gauges and equipment to collect data on rainfall, air and soil temperatures,
and monitoring runoff rates and soil loss at a central point like a school, and then training farmers to monitor
and use the data can provide early warnings about weather threats to newly resettled farmers faced
with making cropping decisions. Significant improvements have been achieved through conventional plant
breeding and the application of DNA molecular tools to improve yields under drought stress conditions
through the development of short-season varieties and water use-efficient varieties. Similarly, breeding for
resistance to pests and diseases that are triggered by weather events provides another important source
of climate risk reduction.

93
7.4.3  Adaptation through change
CSA can augment already existing sustainable agricultural practices to boost production. Changing
planting times and planting depth to suit seasonal weather patterns can reduce the risks of total crop
failure and greatly boost production. ICRISAT has developed approaches that focus on equipping farmers
to use climate-smart scientific interventions and innovations, climate information for cropping decisions,
diversification of livelihoods, links to markets and engaging in profitable agriculture (ICRISAT, 2016). The
result has been renewed support for promoting dry land cereals such as sorghum and millet and greater
support for groundnut value chains. With the support of the Government of Zimbabwe, ICRISAT also
imported 20 tonnes of groundnut seed from Malawi, which was distributed to farmers for seed multiplication
and testing.
7.4.4  Mitigation
The mitigation potential of crop production largely stems from soil and water management or the agroforestry
system under which crops are grown. Alternative sources of energy must also be understood by the farmers,
in which case they would be encouraged through appropriate means to adopt such technologies as biogas
and heat derived from crop stover. For example, farmers in America derive energy from pelletised maize
and wheat residue (see http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/energy/field-crops/resources/shelled-
corn). The adoption of such methods reduces the number of trees cut down, thus locking up more carbon
and enabling the sequestration of more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
7.5  Farming examples associated with CSA practices
The farming examples below show some components of CSA applications in the agro-ecological zones
which are particularly impacted by climate change. Details of these farming practices can be accessed
from the links provided.
7.5.1  The Green Innovation Hub (Muzarabani): mitigation (AEZ IV)
The Green Innovation Hub (GiHUB) focuses on one of the CSA pillars, i.e., mitigation. It is an incubation
platform that seeks to ignite social change and unlock the potential of young people in contributing to
sustainable development through novel ideas around smart energy and the sustainable use of natural
resources. This is integral to the mitigation of the negative effects of climate change. For example,
innovations include cheap, simple and effective direct solar heat pumping systems and access to clean
and sustainable energy for low-income households by means of a biogas production plant. http://www.
sustainzim.org/winners-201516-green-innovations-hub/ (Accessed on 05/08/2017).
7.5.2  Climate-smart villages (Nkayi): adaptation (AEZ IV)
This case study addresses the climate resilience pillar of CSA. Using a multi-model framework for climate,
crop, livestock and socio-economic simulation, customised climate change adaptation packages were
developed for farmers in Nkayi, Zimbabwe. They re-designed smallholder crop and livestock systems
in semi-arid parts of southern Africa to address poverty and enhance resilience to climate change—an
example of stakeholder-driven integrated multi-modelling research. The computer-simulated scenarios
are helping policymakers to make crucial decisions to support farmers. http://www.icrisat.org/wp-content/

7.5.3  OneAcre Management (Gokwe North): all three CSA pillars (AEZ IV)
This is an innovative extension tool that is challenging all stakeholders in the agricultural sector through
the application of the Climate-smart Village concept to transform agriculture in Zimbabwe in the face of
climate change challenges. The aim is to tap into existing institutions and stimulate the adoption of existing
and generated knowledge, technologies and agricultural support services that will best meet the emerging
challenges arising from climate change and variability. This concept brings together, industry, academia,
extension officers and farmers, i.e., appropriate research is taken to the farmer’s field on a platform that
allows for a new approach to holistic intervention, thus covering all three pillars at the same time. http://
www.oneacre.co.zw/ (Accessed on 04/04/2017)
We need technology transfer mechanisms and interventions for the adoption of CSA across the agricultural
sector. The OneAcre Mother-Baby clusters in Gokwe North District are good examples of CSA practices.
Table 7.2 refers to the three CSA pillars.
7.5.4 	 Foundations for Farming (Mashonaland Central Province): climate
resilience (AEZ IV)
The River of Life Church is promoting small-scale conservation farming in post land reform Zimbabwe.
This donor-funded project has its origins at Hinton Estates in Mashonaland Central Province, where it was
widely used on commercial production lands. The initial aim was to take successful cases of commercial
and conservative agricultural practices to the country’s smallholders. http://www.fffzimbabwe.org/?page_

7.5.5 	 Delta Beverages: sorghum production (Chiredzi and Mwenezi):

resilience (sustainable food security [AEZ IV])
Delta Beverages provides a ready market for red and white sorghum for some of Zimbabwe’s small grain
farmers. Small grains are climate-smart in respect of their water-use efficiency and labour requirements
and may also be used to promote food security by improving the staple diet. Extension and farmer training
programmes accompany these out-grower schemes of Delta Beverages, further boosting the adoption
of CSA by industry, extension and farmers. Through this contract farming programme, many families in
Chiredzi and Mwenezi are managing to sustain their livelihoods. http://www.delta.co.zw/media-center/

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Case study 7.1 Climate-smart Village: Hezekiah Village, Nembudziya, Gokwe North District
How did this idea come about?
The vision of a climate-smart village started way back with the village elders expressing their dream
to “transform the village into a green belt” that would maximise the use of available water resources
for diversified cropping beyond key crops like cotton and maize, enhancement of fodder production
for livestock and mechanisation of operations to improve productivity and reduce drudgery. The idea
evolved in recent years to encompass four key elements (i) crop variety testing to match varieties with
local conditions; (ii) development of water sources for irrigation and domestic use; (iii) improvement
of pastures through local multiplication of seeds for grasses and multi-purpose tree legumes; and (iv)
Conservation Agriculture (CA) and introduction of small grains. While many of these initiatives are still in
the formative stages, the idea of a climate-smart village has firmly set root among many of the villagers.
The one-acre concept
“Our ambition is for every household to have at least one acre of a high quality crop every season, both
for dry land crops and for irrigated high value horticulture crops which have been a cash cow for many
families in this village. Many of us went to school, funded by income from cabbages and tomatoes.
These power lines were all paid for by a very good cabbage crop we had some years back. We know
this works and that’s what drives us. We are extending the one-acre concept to production of fodder for
supplementary feeding of livestock during the dry season. We are also doing the same with trees for
multiple uses, including intercropping with field crops. Some are for livestock fodder but some are for
fruit trees like mango, a very good income earner for households here. These ladies are on their way to
plant mango seedlings as you can see and these should do very well given the good moisture. We still
have a long way to go, but the mind-set and the basic ingredients of a climate-smart village are starting
to take shape”.
Mr Dangaiso, Village Headman, Hezekiah village
Under this concept the villagers developed the following:
••
Improvement of pastures and fodder production;
••
Conservation agriculture and adoption of small grains; and
••
Development of local water sources.
Can a climate-smart village approach, result in climate resilience?
The climate-smart village concept at Hezekiah village is in its infancy, but is certainly bringing people
together with a common purpose, driving a broad-based mind-set shift that goes beyond any one practice.
Building resilience to climate risk will require such a multi-pronged response covering many facets of
rural life as demonstrated in this case. Greater external support than what is available to the farmers in
Hezekiah village will be required if we are to go beyond a few isolated examples of climate-smart villages.
A combination of knowledge-driven and market-linked approaches that are anchored on improving food
security and increasing incomes are key to success. The internal drive, vision, ambition and cohesion,
however, will set apart communities that stand, or fall apart in the face of a changing climate.

7.6  Application of CSA to crop production in Zimbabwe
Table 7.3 shows the CSA technologies that can be applied in the respective AEZs in line with CSA practices.
The differences in relation to traditional agriculture (Table 7.1 and CSA, Table 7.3) are found in three features:
being climate change centred, balancing trade-offs in search of sustainable production, and the adaptation
and mitigation outcomes in the wider scheme of things and the possibility of new funding opportunities, for
example, Adaptation Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund and the Voluntary Carbon Market.

7.6.1  Crops: Climate-smart Agriculture case studies
Case Study 7.2  CA for field crops
The Ngwerumes have been practicing CA since 2005. They work closely with Agritex and other
development agencies. They now use CA exclusively after realising its benefits. Reported yield gains
show a four-fold increase while other benefits like higher tolerance of moisture stress are highly
appreciated due to the risks associated with mid-season droughts.
“The yield has improved particularly due to the use of compost in CA systems. Fertility and management
determines yields. We encourage thermal composting using dry matter. It is ready to use in eight weeks.
Some farmers have up to three composts at a time.  By September/October, a CA farmer is ready,
waiting for the rain. We also teach soil testing to ensure that fertiliser applications are precisely matched
with requirements. Farmers are encouraged to put lime three months before rain.”
Mrs Mukotami, Agritex Officer, Ward 24, Goromonzi District
Crop production

98
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Case Study 7.3  Integration through CA
“We dig basins in September, and in October we put compost in the basins. We put lime in September.
We put a small amount of compound D with cup size number 8. Our soils are poor so we maintain the
recommended fertiliser application with size number 8 cup. The crops are getting better and better as
compared to before we started using the compost, better than when we used to rely on fertiliser. There
is a huge difference with others, the maize crop with manure is much better and it doesn’t suffer from
moisture stress even when we have dry spells. Before CA I used to get 1 tonne. Now I plant half a
hectare and I get 3 to 4 tonnes. Now the aim is to keep improving yield through use of manure, rotation,
and improved seed varieties. I’m experimenting with green mulching. I can then use it as supplement for
livestock. Green mulching covers ground, preserving moisture and suppressing weeds. I also intercrop
maize with things like pumpkin, water melons and cucumbers. We get training through workshops and
seminars. I'm Chairman of the Zimbabwe Farmers Union (ZFU) for this ward and vice chairman for
Goromonzi district so I use these platforms to share experiences and lessons with other farmers.”
Mr Ngwerume, Farmer, Goromonzi District
Case Study 7.4  Fodder production and preservation
Poor grazing in Mawanga district during the dry season is key among the challenges facing livestock
farmers. Poor nutrition leads to loss of productivity as cows take long to conceive while those earmarked
for the market fetch poor prices due to low weights. The Ngwerumes grow legume fodder crops such as
Velvet beans (mucuna) to supplement their livestock during the dry season. In addition to growing fodder
they also turn ordinary maize stover into palatable and nutritious feed through urea treatment.
“We plant Mucuna beans to use as fodder for livestock. I feed everything, so nothing gets lost. We
harvest everything and bale manually in a pit that I prepared for that. We can store the bales for as long
as we need. We feed the bales to animals. The seed we sometimes crush and mix with feeds. We put a
bit of manure to improve productivity. Mucuna requires rainfall for at least two months to do well. Mucuna
fertilises the soil as it fixes nitrogen like all legumes. You can cut it and it will revegetate the next season
and give you another crop. We can even plant mucuna amongst the trees as it encourages vertical
growth. Here, mucuna is planted among mazhanje trees.”
I have a pit for urea treatment of crop residue to make very palatable and nutritious feed for my livestock.
From the pit I produce about 500 kg of feed after about six weeks. Cattle love this stuff.  As such my
animals are always in good condition. Some of the maize stover I use as bedding for cattle during the
rainy season. The idea is to get a lot of manure for own use and for selling to the community.”
Mr Ngwerume, Farmer, Goromonzi District
Case Study 7.5  Are integrated CSA approaches applicable at scale in smallholder systems?
The case of the Ngwerumes is a typical example of a well-integrated farming system that should
be the norm rather than an exception in smallholder settings. While current smallholder systems in
Zimbabwe have some elements of complementarities highlighted in this example, there is lots of room
to strengthen these. Achieving higher levels of integration that maximise potential complementarities
will need investment in a number of areas such as information and extension support, market linkages
and innovative financing for smallholder settings. The financial bottlenecks for some of the interventions
are quite pervasive and extend to many other investment ambitions within smallholder agricultural
development programmes. Although most smallholders can afford structured payments for such
investments, the lack of a trusting relationship with the financial sector has undermined access to such
support. If large scale adoptions of integrated approaches to CSA are to happen, many facets of how
smallholders are financed will need reform.

7.7  The relevance of CSA to agricultural (extension) professionals
Agricultural extension in the country has largely been centred on AGRITEX, the government’s extension
department, as a public-sector body and conduit for transferring skills, technologies and knowledge to
improve productivity. However, for the successful adoption of CSA in crop production, at least two of the three
pillars have to be successfully attended to simultaneously, meaning that the country’s extension services
strategy must be transformed and become consolidated between various government departments and
the private sector so as to be able to impart the substantial transformation required in the farming sector.
CSA is a practice that goes well beyond any individual farm enterprise—specifically cropping—and
extension must similarly be more than just a conduit for boosting production. Rather, it must become
the focus for coordinating and absorbing various farm enterprises and actors (the general public, NGOs,
farmer organisations, the private sector and academia) into a holistic agriculture-supporting community.
Specifically, transforming extension can contribute to achieving CSA crop-production objectives through
the following priority milestones:
••
Technology development and information dissemination – developing technologies and encouraging
innovation (being able to determine the types of adaptive changes farmers need and when to make
them; greater involvement in looking for localised solutions; ensuring that relevant technologies and
modes of dissemination keep up with the need for ever-changing climate change adjustments; and
a focus beyond the household). Figure 7.2 illustrates one of the technologies;
••
Strengthening farmers’ capacity-building resilience by strengthening farmers’ human and social
capital (shifting the presentation of technology packages beyond blanket recommendations; new
skills needed at the organisational and individual levels, such as marketing, gender, power and
conflict dynamics);
••
Facilitation and brokering – the bridging function of extension (extension needs skills in new areas
such as building networks, process facilitation, brokerage and process monitoring); and
Figure 7.2  Existing sustainable agricultural practices (mulching) in Zimbabwe
Crop production

100
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
••
Advocacy and policy support – monitoring advocacy and policy support (extension must be actively
involved in monitoring the effects of climate change on agriculture and the progress of CSA efforts,
play an important role at the local level in decentralised governance structures to ensure climate
change remains on the policy agenda and that funds are allocated for CSA programmes, and be
able to explain climate change policies to rural communities).
7.8 	The role of higher and tertiary institutions in climate-smart
practices
Higher and tertiary institutions form the backbone of all efforts to change agricultural practices in Zimbabwe.
Agricultural studies, together with primary and secondary research, have now become concentrated at the
various institutions of higher learning. Extension services, research institutions, the private sector, educational
institutions and agriculture are all local destinations for graduates from local institutions, demonstrating the
role of infusion of CSA into the various curricula of institutions of higher and tertiary education.
Thus, these institutions have the potential to promote CSA adoption in Zimbabwe in a number of ways:
••
Academic, policy and industry-related research geared towards the improvement of crop production
in general;
••
Producing graduates to become climate-smart crop farmers;
••
Producing specialised agricultural scientists for the private sector whose roles will include various
innovations towards CSA through the development of improved and high-yielding crop varieties,
chemicals to handle new weeds and pests, the design and manufacture of appropriate machinery and
tools to make crop production more efficient, and better weather prediction and management tools;
••
Producing future industrialists who are climate-smart and will not only advocate CSA, but be willing
and able to invest in it for productivity and research reasons; and
••
Continuous learning programmes and opportunities for industry, academia and policymakers at all
levels of governance.

7.9  Policies in place with respect to CSA
Zimbabwe has ratified the UNFCCC, but has not yet adopted a stand-alone climate change policy or
legislation. The country has also ratified multilateral environmental agreements such as the Convention
on the Conservation of Biological Diversity and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD). Some of the most important policies (Table 7.4) with respect to intensifying food-crop production
have not fully incorporated climate change aspects into their blueprint.

7.10  Conclusion and recommendations
7.10.1  Conclusions
This chapter has outlined the negative impacts of climate change on national food security in Zimbabwe.
Climate-smart agricultural practices (the three pillars) have been put forward as the panacea for sustainable
food-security in the country. The guiding principles of achieving sustainable food security are the CSA
approaches to germplasm technology, crop diversification and knowledge sharing. The approach taken
in this chapter has been to outline the agricultural practices (conservation agriculture, integrated fertility
management, small-scale irrigation, crop diversification, introduction of drought-tolerant varieties, etc.)
associated with the components of CSA as practised in agro-ecological zones IV and V, where climate
change impacts are most evident in terms of recurrent droughts.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Enabling stronger linkages between academic research and extension, as well as appreciating the value
of local innovations will remain key to the establishment and sustainability of a practical national CSA
programme. As extension workers are pivotal in the implementation and deployment of new technologies
to farmers, it is therefore important that they receive adequate training from colleges and universities.
Government-led initiatives like ZimAsset and Targeted Command Agriculture which are directed towards
sustainable agricultural intensification can explicitly address adaptation and mitigation challenges in order
to reduce constraints on smallholders.
7.10.2  Recommendations
By explicitly focusing on climate change, CSA opens up new opportunities for agricultural research and
development while also augmenting sustainable agricultural practices. Strengthening the links between
health, food security and agriculture in the light of climate change impacts should focus not only on
technologies and practices, but also on the outcome of these interventions beyond the farm gate. The
identification and development of agricultural clusters and incentive schemes for climate-resilient products
to encourage CSA adoption and foster economic transformation will also create a conducive environment
for implementing CSA nationally. For instance, a cotton production cluster in Gokwe (AEZ IV), and a tea
production cluster in Chipinge (AEZ I) can be widely adopted commercially while positively affecting the
social and ecological systems in place.
In addition, existing frameworks such as the National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) and
the INDC are pivotal in introducing CSA as they enhance the adaptation of small-scale farmers, providing
incentives for low-carbon agricultural activities (conservation agriculture, agro forestry) and promoting
integrated land and water management (mixed farming, crop rotation, contour farming). Furthermore,
replicating CSA practices and innovations requires institutional coordination between private and public
agriculture and climate-related institutions at the international, regional, and national levels, including
development partners.

8. 	Climate-smart agriculture
in livestock and rangeland
management in Zimbabwe
Abstract
This chapter describes a range of climate-smart agriculture, livestock and rangeland management
interventions. The interventions are hinged on the three pillars of CSA, namely sustainable productivity,
adaptation and mitigation to climate change. The application of CSA to livestock and rangeland management
is presented in the context of Zimbabwe’s climate change related policies and strategies. The relevance
of CSA interventions in the Zimbabwean livestock industry is also explored through the roles of institutions
of higher learning and extension professionals. Practical activities have been included to help readers to
conceptualise the importance of CSA in livestock and rangeland management in the local (on-farm) context
or from field-based experience. The chapter concludes by discussing policy implications at the national
level and recommendations for the place of CSA in livestock and rangeland management in Zimbabwe.
Keywords: crop-livestock systems, diversification, drought tolerant, rain-fed agriculture, rangeland
management
Key messages
i.
In Zimbabwe, the vulnerability of mixed crop-livestock systems to climate change will be reduced
by the addition or substitution of crop and livestock species and breeds that are more heat- and
drought-tolerant;
ii.
A range of mitigation opportunities available are associated with rangeland and feed management
interventions that subsequently increase overall herd productivity and the resilience of rangelands
to climate change;
iii.	 ICT should be used to improve access to information and prevailing gaps in knowledge about CSA
for rangeland-based livestock systems;
iv.	 The successful adoption of approaches drawn from CSA in Zimbabwe’s livestock sector will require
the mainstreaming of CSA into curricula at institutions of higher learning; and
v.
Institutional and financial support is imperative to enable smallholder farmers to shift to livestock and
rangeland systems that are CSA-based.

8.1  Introduction
Livestock require suitable nutrition, veterinary protection, a well-managed habitat, general good breeding
and management in order to maximise their productivity. Many of these factors are affected by climate
change stressors such as (i) high ambient temperatures; (ii) low or unreliable precipitation; and (iii)
unexpected disease pandemics. The probability of drought-induced crop-livestock system failures ranges
from 40% to 100% in most agro-ecological regions of Zimbabwe (Figure 8.1). Much reduction in net
primary production and carrying capacity is expected in the southern region of Zimbabwe which is suited
to extensive cattle ranching. The level of vulnerability among livestock smallholders is also increased by
soil salinity, outbreaks of foot and mouth diseases, knowledge gaps, and poor access to resources and
markets. On the other hand, livestock, especially ruminants (sheep, goats and cattle), contribute to climate
change through (i) enteric fermentation that produces the greenhouse gases methane and carbon dioxide;
(ii) poor manure management producing the greenhouse gas (GHG) nitrous oxide; and (iii) changes in
land-use patterns along the livestock feed supply chain. CSA is a robust approach aimed at reducing the
vulnerability of livestock and rangelands to climate change whilst also limiting their impacts on the climate
system.
8.1.1  Objectives
By the end of this chapter the reader should be able to:
i.
explain what CSA is in terms of livestock and rangeland management;
ii.
outline the pillars of CSA with respect to livestock and rangeland management;
iii.	 identify appropriate livestock-based policies, strategies and activities that contribute to the pillars of
climate-smart livestock systems; and
iv.	 recommend CSA policies and practices that are suitable in one's own area in managing livestock
and rangelands productively and sustainably.
The frequent and severe droughts that have become common over almost the past decade have reduced
dry-season natural grass and browse resources in the main beef-producing areas of Matabeleland,
Masvingo, Midlands and northern parts of Mashonaland. Dairy cows, pigs and poultry depend heavily
on cereal crops for feed. Small ruminants (sheep and goats) are currently under-utilised resources in
Zimbabwe because they are poorly linked to the formal domestic and export meat markets.

Thornton et al. (2006) and Jones and Thornton (2013, 2015)
Activity 1. Look up the United Nations definition and accompanying elaboration of the word “sustainability”
and relate the definition to livestock and rangeland management. Discuss this concept with your
peers to consolidate your understanding. What is climate-smart agriculture in terms of livestock and
rangeland management?
8.2 Situational analysis of Zimbabwe’s livestock sector
Most of the livestock in Zimbabwe (cattle, sheep, goats and indigenous pigs) are kept on rangelands that
occupy 76.8% of the total land area. Overall, the cattle of communal and resettled smallholders make up 90%
of the five million national herds and routinely exploit the “patchy” nature of local vegetation, which changes
with variations in soil condition. Forage production is unstable due to low (400 mm or less per year) and
unpredictable rainfall, and livestock population dynamics are driven by the direct effect of rainfall on annual
herbage production. The livestock sector currently contributes 18% of total agricultural domestic product and
has the potential to increase this to 36%. Livelihoods in southern Zimbabwe are predominantly based on
livestock and are limited in food- and cash-cropping, as they are normally affected by widespread droughts.

107
The high degree of vulnerability of this livestock-producing region is compounded by economic
marginalisation due to low rainfall. Inherent droughts often result in reduced water supply, quantity and
quality of feed and food resources, increased spread of vector-borne livestock diseases and disease
vectors, and heat stress. These factors affect feed intake and animal productivity, claiming large numbers
of livestock per year, perpetuating food insecurity as well as reducing the supply of primary products down
the value chains. Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) is predicted to decline by 10%, 15%, 16% and 14% in
the Gwayi, Mzingwane, Runde and Save catchments respectively under business-as-usual conditions by
2050 (Davis and Hirji, 2014). Net Primary Production (NPP) will decline from over eight to five tonnes per
hectare per year by 2080. This translates into a decrease in the rangeland carrying capacity for livestock,
with the southwest and northwest regions experiencing greater reductions in NPP than other parts of the
country. Variable climate events present a unique stocking management problem for farmers.
To make matters worse, livestock, especially ruminants (sheep, goats and cattle), also contribute to climate
change mainly through GHG emissions (methane) and poor manure management (nitrous oxide). Of the
14% of global GHG contributed by agriculture, about 65% is contributed by cattle. The overall direct GHG
emissions from livestock and feed production constitute some 80% of total global agricultural emissions.
Activity data used for Zimbabwe’s livestock GHG inventory includes spatially diverse information such as
livestock numbers and areas of grassland burnt, that are obtained from a combination of sources such as
censuses, surveys, farmer interviews, filed observations, remote sensing and expert knowledge. Figure
8.2 shows the national inventory of GHG emissions from Zimbabwe's agricultural sector. The estimates
of livestock GHG emissions are based on the IPCC Guidelines (2006) Tier I method of multiplying activity
data, e.g., number of animals in each livestock species by default regional emission factors.

sector analysis of GHGs; and (b) domesticated ruminant methane emissions between 1990
and 2010 (Mapanda and Svinurai, 2015). Also see Appendix I in this chapter.
Although climate change contributes to rangeland degradation, rangelands can be used to reduce climate
change pressures through carbon sequestration. Fortunately many options exist to conserve or reverse
rangeland degradation in specific livestock habitats, inclusive of wildlife management. This is particularly

important for sustainability. The key constraints on livestock and rangeland management in Zimbabwe are
technical as well as policy-related and can be summarised as:
i.
Increased frequency of droughts or long dry spells that cause severe on-farm shortages of forage
and falls in the livestock sector’s share of agricultural GDP;
ii.
Inadequate grazing infrastructure (fence, water points, dip tanks);
iii. Alarming spread of notifiable diseases, particularly foot and mouth disease; and
iv.	 A lack of a rangeland or pasture development and management strategies. This includes grazing
management, rangeland rehabilitation and a lack of climate-smart fodder crops.
Activity 2. Discuss with a colleague or two how we can sustainably manage the crop-livestock nexus
in a way that contributes to intensification and diversification of environmentally sustainable livestock
production, and to reduce the risks and levels of vulnerability.
Activity 3. There is little information on how these interactions may be affected by changes in climate and
climate variability. How do you think this serious gap in knowledge might be closed so that crop-livestock
interactions may offer some buffering capacity to help smallholders sustain productivity, adapt, and offer
mitigation options in response to climate change?
Reducing the environmental footprint of livestock is imperative. Innovative responses are needed from
livestock researchers and extension practitioners by embracing cross-cutting issues. According to ZimVac
(2015), livestock has the potential to be an important source of both household food and farm income, yet
its contribution in smallholder farming areas of Zimbabwe is low due to the fact that per-capita ownership
of livestock has worsened. This can easily be traced to over-reliance on rain-fed agriculture and low-end
technology. At full capacity of resource utilisation, opportunities exist in the entire livestock production
chain, since the sector already employs 70% of smallholder crop-and-livestock farmers, supplies raw
materials to the food-manufacturing industry and enhances food security.
8.3  Guiding concepts of CSA with respect to livestock and rangeland
management
The main guiding concept under the theme of livestock and rangeland management is that CSA must be
adopted along the livestock value chains using the “farm-to-fork” concept. This may be defined as food
production at the farm level going down to consumers through intermediary processes supported by value
chain actors and support corridors like farmers’ networks, processors, transporters, abattoirs, wholesalers
and retailers (Camagni and Kherallah, 2014). The pre-farm part of the value chain, i.e., the manufacture
and distribution of inputs (seed, fertiliser, feed, water, energy, and veterinary drugs) is critical in inserting
raw materials into the value chain.
8.3.1 	 Relationship of livestock and rangeland management with the three
pillars of CSA
Livestock and rangeland management options should add value to the diversity of desirable interventions
that are likely to be effective and efficient in the Zimbabwe context in order to ensure positive outcomes
that are directly related to all three pillars of CSA, namely:
Productivity. Where rangelands are managed to enhance both biological and economic field-level
efficiencies, they can offer the cheapest feed resources. They can be utilised sustainably by maintaining
a good balance between and among different livestock value chains. In Zimbabwe, this may be achieved
through: (i) maintaining a rangeland free of pests and predators; (ii) increasing the population of beneficial
plants and animals; (iii) increasing or stabilising pollination services by insects to increase crop production;

109
and (iv) managing the timing and flow of rainwater within the rangeland ecosystem. Crop-livestock systems
are based on complementarity and mutual benefits (Scherr et al., 2012; Harvey et al., 2013).
Adaptation. In the face of climate change, livestock and rangeland management should opt for resilience
through a diversity of land uses and promote biodiversity across the rangelands. The main message is that
the negative impacts of climate change are mostly beyond the reach or control of livestock farmers and the
only way to sustain livelihoods is not to fight with nature but to embrace it innovatively. This should be done
to reduce losses from pests, parasites, diseases and climate change stressors such as recurrent droughts
and flash floods. The proof of the adaptation concept lies in the realisation that a more diversified portfolio
of livestock and rangeland management for better food and nutrition security and income streams can act
as a buffer against the shocks of climate change.
Mitigation. A more diversified landscape management system that promotes reforestation, natural and
irrigated pasture development and over-sowing rangelands with useful grass and legume species results in
increased plant populations and hence the utilisation of carbon dioxide via natural photosynthesis (carbon
sinking) (FAO, 2012). Also see table in Appendix I of this chapter.
8.4  Case studies
Case study 8.1: Livestock practices
In Zimbabwe, sustainable livestock farming has been achieved on smallholdings and ranches in the past
through a number of production systems which range from smallholder mixed crop-livestock systems
to intensive livestock rearing. The key feature that makes these systems climate-smart is that crops
can produce resources (crop residues or cash) that can be used to manage livestock. In the face of a
changing climate, livestock can provide manure to crops, as well as cash to cushion farmers against
climate risks in times of crop failure. The integration results in greater farm efficiency, productivity and
sustainability.  Conservation agriculture practices have been implemented through the sustainable
intensification of production, thus ensuring food security while contributing towards efforts to mitigate
climate change, whilst crop residues have been used to feed livestock.
Case study 8.2: National drought mitigation strategy
Zimbabwe’s national drought mitigation strategy is a seasonal emergency plan that the Ministry of
Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development (MoAMID) manages based on statistics from a
joint partnership between the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), the World Food
Programme (WFP) and the FAO’s Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS). GIEWS
provides crop and food production forecasts which pre-warn livestock producers in drought-prone areas.
The national drought mitigation strategy provides a situation analysis of the agricultural sector and
recommends strategies for implementation to reduce the effects of drought, based on the crops and
livestock assessment reports of the preceding season. In the 2015 to 2016 season, livestock drought-
mitigation interventions aimed to (i) promote early destocking; (ii) support the provision of subsidised
stock feeds; (iii) promote pen fattening programmes; (iv) encourage hay banking; (v) undertake FMD
vaccination; (vi) repair and drill more boreholes; (vii) prevent and control veld fires; and (viii) explore the
feasibility of fodder crop production under irrigation. However, early warning systems and programmes
have deteriorated due to inadequate funding, the deterioration of weather-monitoring infrastructure
and capacity, limited technology, and capacity for modelling climate projections. The design and
implementation of early action responses has therefore become difficult locally.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Case study 8.3: Rangeland and livestock research interventions
The Department of Research and Specialists Services (DRSS), through its livestock research stations,
has conducted a lot of trials demonstrating that technology-based feed and feeding interventions are
useful for improving feed utilisation potential as well as increasing livestock productivity. These include
improved grazing management and animal response trials at the Grassland, Makoholi and Matopos
Research Stations. The use of improved pasture and agroforestry species has been demonstrated
at Grassland Research Station, including the use of nutritious diet supplements that reduce methane
production in ruminants. The retail outlet-based distribution of multi-nutrient blocks has shown that the
digestibility of fibrous feeds can be improved drastically. Since livestock production in smallholder areas
subsists on fibrous crop residues and veld pastures that lack adequate proteins, energy, minerals and
vitamins, better utilisation is achieved if supplementation is carried out using the high-density nutrient
block. The most popular method of supplementation is the use of urea, molasses and mineral blocks.
These nutrient blocks increase the productivity of meat and milk and promote higher reproductive
efficiency in livestock species, hence reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the rumen and manure.
Case study 8.4: Livestock health management interventions
Livestock health management interventions aimed at preventing animal diseases such as foot and
mouth disease, as well as Newcastle and African swine fever vaccination programmes, have been
carried out by the Department of Veterinary Services and Livestock Production and Development. Other
key measures for disease-free livestock production encouraged by the Zimbabwe Herd Book include
the management of herd sizes and age structures. In grazing livestock systems, interventions aimed
at increasing heat tolerance through the use of heat-tolerant indigenous breeds like the Mashona, Tuli
and Nkone have been promoted. Appropriate manure-management practices, especially in rural areas,
have been promoted by the Department of Agricultural, Technical and Extension Services since political
independence in 1980. It has been shown that, if livestock waste (excreta) is processed properly, nitrous
oxide emissions will be reduced drastically. On the other hand, the manure produced will help improve
crop or pasture productivity. Successfully tried options include the anaerobic digestion of manure stored
in liquid form or slurry that lowers methane emissions while producing useful energy. Another option is to
compost solid manures to reduce nitrous oxide emissions while producing organic fertiliser.
8.5 Application of CSA practices in livestock value chains in Zimbabwe
CSA can be effective if interventions are identified and applied at each level of the value chain, e.g., input
processes, grazing management, feed supplementation, manure management, animal breeding, veterinary
protection, marketing and the processing of animal products. The roles of each player in the value chain
also need to be elucidated and synchronised. Elsewhere, cases of holistic rangeland management and
ultra-high density grazing implemented by Allan Savory and others have been accepted as applications of
CSA practices in livestock and rangeland management. However, whilst holistic rangeland management is
climate-smart, the Allan Savory approach has not been accepted in the field of rangeland science. Climate-
smart agricultural practices applicable to livestock and rangeland management in Zimbabwe include but
are not limited to:
i.
Application of science and advanced technology in feeding and nutrition through appropriate feed
formulation and precision feeding;
ii.
Over-sowing legumes in grazing paddocks, especially in the high veld (high rainfall region);
iii. Bio-fortification of livestock forage;
iv.	 Application of science and advanced technology in genetics and reproduction;
v.
Improved animal herd or flock health control programming; and
vi.	 General improvements in animal husbandry.

111
The extension of these approaches in Zimbabwe are beneficial because of large productivity gaps in the
smallholder sector as well as the fact that CSA practices listed above can help with mitigation and building
resilience to climate change. Practices alone will not be effective as there is a need for policy support that
promotes early warning through the forecasting of risks and continuous scoping of the impacts of climate
change so that prompt responses build resilience among livestock farmers. Livestock utilises the largest
proportion of land resources in Zimbabwe, with grazing land occupying up to 65% of land. Over the years,
increases in stocking densities have resulted in overgrazing and rangeland degradation. Over-utilisation
of rangelands has also caused deforestation in some areas. Because of the long dry season, livestock
in Zimbabwe subsists on poor-quality feed, thus worsening methane and nitrous oxide emissions from
ruminant digestion and manure management respectively.
8.5.1 CSA entry points in livestock and rangeland management
There are numerous entry points for initiating CSA programmes in livestock value chains to enhance
productivity, adaptation and mitigation actions. For CSA practices in livestock and rangeland management to
be effective, value-chain approaches should be embraced widely because this brings relevant stakeholders
together to make decisions in a coordinated way (Vermeulen et al., 2008). This also creates a pathway for
the inclusion of smallholders in modern livestock value chains so that they can embrace practices such
as the use of well-formulated feeds that reduce methane production, better manure management that
reduces emissions of nitric oxide, and planting pastures that assimilate carbon dioxide (Gerber, 2015).
Drought-tolerant crops like small grains and fodder like Brazilian gold grass, bana grass, cowpeas, lablab,
lucerne, thornless acacia, and pigeon pea may be championed in the drier provinces. The rearing of
improved indigenous livestock species through selection can increase the population of drought-, disease-
and heat-tolerant livestock breeds.
Activity 4. Do you think the value chain and rangeland landscape system approaches mentioned earlier
are relevant, effective, efficient and have the desired impact on mainstreaming CSA within livestock value
chains? What obstacles and opportunities do you expect to counter?
8.5.2 CSA at the input processes level
8.5.2.1 Resolving poor soil fertility to improve the quality of crop residues and pastures
Good-quality feed is well known for reducing the enteric fermentation that produces methane in ruminants.
To obtain abundant high-quality crop residues, dryland and irrigated pastures, soil nutrient depletion should
be reversed by these practices:
i.
Using legume forages as green manure. This is achieved by intercropping suitable legumes like
groundnuts rotated with staple crops, mainly cereal grains. The legume tops can be fed to livestock
as protein-providing crop residues;
ii.
Using legume forages as green manure in agroforestry systems;
iii.	 Using legume forages as green manure in forage legume/grass mixtures. This will result in 13-34%
of fixed nitrogen transferred from legume to grasses;
iv.	 Mass production of forage legumes such as velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens), lablab (Lablab
purpureus), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), lucerne (Medicago sativa),
leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), thornless acacia (Acacia angustissima), and sesbania (Sesbania
sesban) as protein sources to improve feed-conversion efficiency, thus decreasing enteric methane
emissions by about 25-33%; and
v.
Sequestering carbon into the soil through ancient practices like mixing carbon with ash. Potash
improves soil fertility, while soil fauna utilise the carbon.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Case study 8.5 Fodder production and preservation for livestock feeding:
Guyu Communal Area, Gwanda District
What is the nature of climate risk in Guyu?
“Guyu falls under the dry Natural Region V. We receive between 280 to 300 mm of rainfall annually.
Temperatures can go up to 45oC. Cattle and goats are the main form of livelihood for farmers here.
Cropping is nearly impossible because of the harsh climate but farmers still plant maize, cowpeas,
and small grains such as sorghum and millet. The soils are poor and sandy, highly fragile and prone to
erosion. As you can see this also leads to massive siltation of rivers, including the Thuli river which is the
biggest river here.  Even our 32 hectare irrigation scheme which draws water from the Thuli river uses
sand abstraction as the river is heavily silted resulting in base flow being more reliable than surface flow.
Food security is a major issue here. Farmers rely on selling livestock to buy food.  We have monthly
livestock auctions for cattle and goats. Buyers are usually abattoirs and individual traders. The biggest
threat to livestock production is the shortage of fodder during the dry season. The last drought wiped out
large numbers of cattle due to shortage of feed.”
Mr. Dlomo, Agritex Officer Guyu, Gwanda
Locally driven research on fodder
In Guyu, the concept of growing fodder for supplementing livestock during the dry season was introduced
by the Matopos based International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). The
intervention focuses on encouraging livestock farmers to grow hardy but highly nutritious fodder legumes
such as velvet beans (Mucuna), Sunhemp, Dolichos Lablab, and cowpeas. These legumes are highly
tolerant to moisture stress and can be very productive even in the harsh climate typical of Natural Region
V.  Farmers with reliable water sources were also encouraged to plant other types of fodder such as
Lucerne, Bana grass and Katambora Rhodes grass as these usually require supplementary irrigation.
A number of farmers are now tasked with the responsibility of locally multiplying the seed that was
brought in through the ICRISAT initiative in collaboration with Matopo Research, with a view to making
it locally available for farmers. In addition to growing fodder crops farmers have also been trained in
low cost techniques for preserving and enhancing the nutritional value of crop residue such as maize
stover. Techniques such as urea treatment are now being used by farmers to transform unpalatable, low
nutritional value crop residues into high quality feeds that are appropriate for livestock earmarked for
sale. Bales of properly preserved fodder can be kept for years without losing nutritional value, serving
as a valuable emergency feed in the event of droughts or veld fires. Farmers producing more than they
need are now selling excess fodder to their neighbours, thereby diversifying their income base. With
some farmers having as many as 200 herd of cattle, the stakes are high. The threat of losing animals due
to lack of grazing is real as demonstrated by the recent drought (2016/2017 rainy season).
Preservation of fodder
Techniques for fodder preservation are highly priced by farmers like Mr Makwala. They have learnt to
bale fodder and store it for use during the dry season, starting in June until November when the rains
come. Urea treatment of maize stover also produces high quality but low cost stock feed. After harvesting
maize the dry stover is chopped into small pieces that are loaded into the treatment pit, sprinkled with
feed quality urea and some water. The mixture is covered in black plastic for 6 weeks after which it is
removed from the pit for storage or feeding.
Can fodder Production and preservation drive climate resilience in dry regions of Zimbabwe?
Fodder production and preservation is clearly one of the most relevant climate-smart interventions in
drier regions where grazing shortages during the dry season and droughts is a major cause of poor

113
livestock productivity and deaths. The success of this approach in places like Guyu which is in one of
Zimbabwe’s driest regions implies that the practice can be used virtually everywhere in the country.
Even in higher potential areas, production of high quality fodder can be used to improve productivity of
livestock through supplementary feeding in winter as well as getting livestock ready for the market. The
low-cost nature of this approach and the unlimited potential to multiply seed locally makes it accessible
even to poorer households who otherwise cannot afford to buy commercial feeds. Large tracks of fallow
land in most communal areas around the country, some of it abandoned due to declining soil fertility or
lack of inputs, could be brought into production of fodder, boosting performance of livestock. Most of the
fodder species are legumes that require minimal additional fertilisation as they fix their own nitrogen.
Field crops planted after these legumes also benefit from the nitrogen fixed in the previous year, making
these lands viable for cropping again. With their broad leaves most of the legumes also suppress weeds,
reducing labour requirement and even diminishing weed pressure for other food crops in subsequent
yields. Dual purpose varieties of fodder crops such as sorghum and cowpeas are particularly easy to
integrate with typical smallholder cropping systems as they also contribute to food security. Innovative
treatment of maize stover with urea is virtually applicable in almost all communal area contexts as maize
is a major part of the cropping system. This will not only add nutritional value to the crop residue but will
also make preservation and storage easier, avoiding losses due to fires and natural elements. Most of
the work happens during the off-season when farmers are not busy in the fields, making such practices
compatible with the labour budgets of typical smallholder farmers.

8.5.2.2 CSA in grazing management
8.5.2.2.1  Promoting carbon sequestration and reversing deforestation and rangeland
degradation
Carbon sequestration in plants simply means using up the carbon dioxide so that emissions into the
atmosphere are mitigated. Plants assimilate carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into starch through
photosynthesis. Planting a lot of grasses, legumes and trees, either on a dry-land basis or under irrigation,
increases plant population density and hence the surface area for photosynthesis (leaf area index) and
the production of biomass. Preventing the wanton cutting of trees and promoting tree-planting policies and
strategies have the potential to increase carbon assimilation in woody plants. Preventing more degradation
and re-establishing degraded grasslands can be done through rotational grazing management and veld
reinforcement as mitigation strategies.
8.5.2.2.2  Reducing post-harvest losses of hay
Interventions focused on establishing storage banks of fodder and hay can help reduce post-harvest losses
due to spontaneous fires, moulds, pests and rodents and hence deliver multiple benefits through productivity
and adaptation. Drilling more boreholes for livestock is a plausible intervention in the southern region of
Zimbabwe, where rainwater is seasonally low. In semi-arid Namibia, for instance, projects implemented
by NGOs like NOLIDERP and the Millennium Challenge Account – Namibia, and Meatco Foundation have
proved that sinking boreholes and establishing watering points within the rangelands have a profound effect
on mechanisms adapting livestock to heat stress (http://www.fanrpan.org/documents/d01760/, 2014).
8.5.2.3  CSA in feed supplementation
The techniques presented below are already being implemented by some large-scale commercial
farmers. Feed supplementation is traditionally meant to correct nutrient deficiencies, but of late it has been
discovered that the practice can be used to reduce net greenhouse emissions from livestock (Clark, 2009).
Climate-smart agriculture in livestock and rangeland management in Zimbabwe

114
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
The effectiveness of the following six strategic techniques to decrease methane emissions from ruminants
have been proved through applied research:
i.
Improved forage quality: feeding ruminants with good-quality roughage increases the activity of
rumen cellulolytic bacteria at the expense of the methanogens that produces methane gas;
ii.
A larger proportion of concentrates in the diet that are well-balanced to meet animal requirements
promotes rumen fermentation that suppresses methane production. Feeding at least 55% forage and
up to 45% concentrates in high-producing dairy cows decreases methane production significantly.
Up to 8.5% of the dietary energy intake can be lost as methane (Clark, 2009);
iii.	 More rumen-resistant starch in the ruminant diet results in lower methane production in the rumen;
iv.	 Adding fats and oils when it is economic and at levels that do not affect digestion has been shown to
lower dietary energy losses in the form of methane by up to 37% (Clark, 2009);
v.
Secondary plant metabolites improve feed conversion efficiency and in the process reduce methane
production; and
vi. Feed additives boost feed utilisation efficiency and reduce pollutants in manure. Novel mitigation
opportunities consist of adding feed additives like prebiotics, probiotics, acetogens, ionophores,
bacteriocins, organic acids and plant extracts like condensed tannins. Many enzymes like phytases
are already in use by commercial feed companies.
8.5.2.4  CSA in manure management
Intensive livestock production creates challenges in managing the large volumes of manure produced.
Manure contributes to greenhouse gases, but conscious efforts can be made to capture the manure in
solid, liquid or slurry form. It can then be stored, treated and utilised to enrich soils in an environmentally
sustainable manner through biogas production.
8.5.2.5  CSA in animal breeding
CSA interventions in animal breeding can be effected by using strategic crosses to combine complimentary
traits that adapt the resultant crossbred animals to climate change. Breeding productive animals that are
well-adapted to heat stress and are drought-tolerant is achieved through crossbreeding. Accelerating the
spread of the desirable traits is achievable through assisted animal reproduction. This involves artificial
insemination with service being natural or assisted through heat synchronisation. Though requiring a lot of
expensive resources, innovative arrangements can be made at the community level, where farmers benefit
from social capital.
Activity 5. It is important to note that CSA is context-specific. From your own practical experience of
working with livestock farmers, (i) list additional practices; and (ii) provide possible interventions
that you deem applicable to smallholder livestock farmers in your area. Specify the livestock
species in each case. As an extension officer, outline a step-by-step approach that you will use
to help livestock value chain actors identify where improvements along the chain can be made
using CSA.
8.6  The role of extension professionals in CSA
In Zimbabwe, technical and market information is disseminated to farmers through extension services and
agriculture marketing authorities respectively. Extension practitioners are expected to be abreast of the
latest livestock production processes, including trouble-shooting techniques. Climate change awareness
is now noticeable among farmers, and they need to be guided accordingly by extension professionals. This
means that the latter should always provide adequate information to farmers so that they retain the trust
and respect farmers have for them. There is a need to ensure that extension workers are knowledgeable

115
and have access to information on climate and CSA practices through ICT and in-service training. Because
most of the farmers that extension professionals will be dealing with are woman in rural areas, extension
staff need to be well-versed in issues of gender balance and gender empowerment so that they can
effectively assign roles, responsibilities and capabilities to both men and women in implementing CSA.
Extension plays an intermediate role in technology transfer.
Activity 6. Do you agree that global attention to agriculture as one of the most climate-vulnerable sectors
provides an opportunity to accelerate a much needed reform of extension and advisory services? Support
your position to a colleague in a one-to-one discussion.
8.7  The role of institutions of higher learning
Institutions of higher education are in a better position to produce and disseminate information about all
value chain segments from "farm to fork", including conditions involving the development of regulations
and standards to deal with climate change. Zimbabwe has over 10 universities that offer animal science
degrees and many agricultural colleges train research and extension professionals at various levels. The
University of Zimbabwe and Mazowe Veterinary College also produce a lot of veterinary practitioners.
Therefore, in order to produce functional graduates, it is necessary to anchor CSA in the various modules
taught at these national institutions through curricula reviews. Graduates from these institutions are future
national actors in implementing changes at the field level. Thus, institutions of higher learning should be
prepared to:
i.
Facilitate the implementation of novel CSA policies for livestock and rangelands and their execution;
ii.
Support the integration of CSA for livestock and rangelands-related knowledge into national curricula;
iii.	 Implement new CSA for livestock and rangeland practices in respective departments at these
institutions; and
iv.	 Inspire internal changes that prepare college and university lecturers to embrace and employ new
CSA competencies in their everyday responsibilities.
Institutions of higher learning in Zimbabwe need to heighten their concern for gender-sensitive approaches
to achieving CSA in livestock and rangeland management. They should also champion research to
understand better how men and women can adapt to climate change, mitigate emissions and at the same
time maintain food and nutritional security. Institutions of higher education need to research and offer more
solutions for how ICTs such as radio, television, video, the internet, and media and mobile services can
play a pivotal role in facilitating CSA in livestock and rangeland management.
8.8  Policy implications of CSA for livestock and rangeland management
It is vital for Zimbabwe to have institutional and policy adjustments specifically geared towards supporting the
transition to climate-smart agriculture. The main requirements for creation of an enabling policy environment
that will promote climate-smart agriculture to enhance food security and mitigate GHG emissions are greater
coherence, coordination and integration between climate change, livestock development and food-security
policy. It is commendable that Zimbabwe is currently developing a National Livestock Policy recognising
that climate change is real and that it contains some approaches that are CSA-compliant. More needs to be
done for the livestock sub-sector plans to have stronger CSA components, especially at field-level planning,
implementing and monitoring of CSA-inclined livestock and rangeland projects and programmes.
Actions to reduce GHG emissions in Zimbabwe’s livestock sector have been pronounced at policy level
(Svinurai and Mharapara, 2015). The government uses the Environmental Management Act to take legal
actions against farmers who burn rangelands uncontrollably. The non-prescribed burning of savanna
rangelands reduces their capacity to regrow (carbon assimilation) and to compensate for carbon losses
in grazed and burned biomass. The negative impacts of veld fires include GHG emissions, reduction in
Climate-smart agriculture in livestock and rangeland management in Zimbabwe

116
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
rainwater infiltration, increased soil erosion, reduced soil carbon, biodiversity loss and loss of human and
animal life. Some practices to control fires include early burning (cool season fire) to reduce the destructive
levels of uncontrolled veldt fires, and the establishment of fireguards by either controlled back burning or
the slashing of grasses along potential fire starting areas such as roads and railway lines. Policies that are
not financially supported will not produce the desired results, especially for cattle, whose turnover period
is at least three years, while rangeland responses can take up to a decade. An example is the fact that the
Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) initiated in the 1980s
contributed significantly to socio-economic and ecological resilience and sustainable development in some
communal rangelands. However, continued implementation of the programme has been hampered by a
lack of adequate financial and technical support.
8.9  Conclusion and recommendations
This chapter concludes that CSA is imperative for livestock and rangeland management because livestock
value chains are intertwined directly and indirectly with declining precipitation levels and global warming.
It can also be concluded that local innovation with respect to adaptation and mitigation of climate change
in livestock value chains requires an extension system that is unquestionably knowledgeable in CSA
approaches. We can conclude that investments through innovative inclusive financing should be arranged
to increase sources of rural income and make rural households more resilient and predictable in order to
ensure the sustained migration of rural households out of poverty, using climate-compatible livestock and
range-management pathways.
It is therefore recommended that:
i.
CSA should be embraced using a multifaceted approach that encompasses rangeland landscapes,
livestock value chains, and environmental and socio-economic policies;
ii.
The use of climate science data for livestock and rangeland management planning can reduce the
uncertainties generated by climate change, develop early warning systems for drought, flash floods
and incidences of pest and disease, and thus increase the capacity of farmers to deal with their
vulnerabilities and reduce risks; and
iii.	 Extension professionals and institutions of higher learning have a central role to play in livestock
farmers' ability to access CSA information.

9.	 Sustainable forest management
and agroforestry
Abstract
In light of the climate change risks mentioned in the introductory chapter, this chapter focuses on how
forests, Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) and agroforestry can contribute to combating climate
change. It also explores how land degradation is linked to climate change and shows how sustainable
forest management addresses forest degradation and deforestation while increasing the direct benefits to
people, and efforts to combat climate change. One section is devoted to how agroforestry can be practised
by deliberately integrating woody perennials (e.g., trees, shrubs, palms or bamboos) and agricultural crops
or animals on the same piece of land in some form of spatial and temporal arrangement. In this context,
the importance of trees for human well-being and how they provide humans with good and services (forest
ecosystem goods and services for household consumption, including food, fuelwood and medicines) is
discussed. The discussion also goes into how the planting of trees in croplands increases the absorptive
capacity of the soil and reduces evapotranspiration, raindrop impact, soil erosion and the soil temperature
of the crops planted beneath. Towards the end of the chapter it is shown how forestry and agroforestry
contribute to the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture.
Key Words: agroforestry, climate change, forestry, land degradation, sustainable forest management
Key messages
At the end of this chapter, readers are expected to be able to:
i.
Understand forests, deforestation, sustained forests management and agroforestry in the context of
climate change;
ii.
Analyse the drivers of deforestation and how they can be minimised;
iii.	 Explain terms related to SFM and agroforestry;
iv.	 Explain how forests help in climate change mitigation and adaptation; and
v.
Finally, identify CSA components relevant to forests, land degradation and agroforestry.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
9.1  Introduction
Forest ecosystems are important for life and supplying important goods and services, yet they are also
threatened by several anthropogenic factors, including clearing for agriculture, use of wood fuel, accidental
fires, and climate change. This chapter is divided into five sections as follows: Section 9.1, on the importance
of forests and their classification; Section 9.2, on the linkages of land degradation to climate change and
forests; Section 9.3, on sustainable forest management and climate change; Section 9.4, on agroforestry
and CSA, and finally Section 9.5,  on some forestry-related aspects in Zimbabwe.
In line with the theme of the Manual, i.e., CSA linkages to forest and agroforestry, climate change will
be discussed with respect to their role in CSA. It is evident that climate change is a threat to the well-
being of humanity. However, forests can still provide a partial solution to this threat, since they are closely
connected to climate change—that is, forest loss and the consequent land degradation both contribute to
climate change. Agriculture, land use, land-use change and forestry jointly contribute about a quarter of all
global GHG emissions.9

It is therefore logical that, by conserving forests we are also reducing carbon emissions, since they
sequester carbon from the atmosphere. Since the destruction of forests has a considerable impact on
climate change, this may also impinge on the multiple benefits for biodiversity and humanity. These include
reducing GHG emissions by acting as a carbon sink and the preservation of functioning virgin forests,
giving us a fighting chance to combat climate change. Forests and trees on farms, i.e., agroforestry, can
also be a significant carbon sink—one that can be can be enhanced through afforestation and conservation
efforts, including carbon sequestration in biomass and soils.
9.1.1  Importance of forests
Forests are areas of land with trees higher than five
metres and a minimum canopy cover of 10 percent,
excluding land that is mainly used for agriculture or urban
use. Trees may be temporarily absent in managed forests
and still be classified as forest land (FAO, 2015a). The
potential impacts of climate change on forests include
changes in species composition, shifts in forest ecosystem
boundaries and species ranges, changes in growth rates,
increased flora and fauna migration, loss of biodiversity, increased frequency and intensity of forest fires,
and increased reliance on trees and forests for survival, leading to over-exploitation. The majority of local
communities sustain their livelihoods by direct use of the goods and services. The forest ecosystem provides
for household consumption (food, fuelwood and medicines) and the generation of incomes from trade in
both timber and Non-timber Forest Products (NTFPs). To continue utilising these goods and services,
forests should be managed sustainably to support one of the Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 15).
Furthermore, the delivery of goods and services is threatened by climate change, consequently impacting
rural livelihoods and the forest industry.
In smallholder farming systems, forests and farms often form part of complex rural landscapes, which
collectively fulfil the livelihood needs of rural inhabitants. Increasing the resilience of forest systems to
maintain and enhance the flow of the ecosystem’s goods and services, mitigating emissions from the
sector by reducing deforestation and increasing forest cover and agroforestry are some of the interventions
that contribute to CSA, but these need to be considered in the context of the wider landscape (Mbow et al.,
2014; Locatelli et al., 2015).

9.1.2  Classification of forest resources in Zimbabwe
There are several classification systems for Zimbabwean forest ecosystems. One of them is the Ecosystem
Land Classification Approach adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) (2010a), which
divides Zimbabwe into five eco-regions, which are based not only on floral compositions but also on
landscape characteristics (Table 9.1).

Classification Approach (CBD, 2010a)

The other classification of the natural forest ecosystem is the Flora Zambesiaca and Afromontane phyto-
region based on floral composition (White, 1983). The Afromontane phyto-region covers 781 500 ha. The
Flora Zambesiaca comprises five woodlands types: dry Miombo (17 690 074 ha), Mopane (12 277 515 ha),
Combretum-Terminalia (2 374 729 ha), Acacia (1 581 070 ha) and Zambezi teak (1 404 544 ha).
Indigenous woodland conservation has become a priority in Zimbabwe. This has been made all the more
necessary by the increase in the number of smallholder tobacco farmers, who mainly depend on firewood
to cure tobacco (Manyanhaire and Kurangwa, 2014). Agriculture, and in particular tobacco production,
has become the major driver of deforestation, being up to 10 times more aggressive than the sum of all
other factors in Zimbabwe (Sacchetto, 2012). Clearing land for tobacco planting, barn construction and the
curing processes themselves requires large quantities of wood (up to 37 m3 wood/1 kg of tobacco) resulting
in deforestation and forest degradation (Sacchetto, 2012).
Plantation forests account for 0.4% of the land area covering 155 000 ha and consist of exotic species
of pines, eucalyptus and the black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) (Patterson et al., 2007). These plantations
are concentrated in the eastern part of the country, where rainfall is high enough to sustain tree growth
and productivity, and they are a source of timber, poles, pulp and paper, tannin and furniture. There are
also smaller plantations of eucalyptus in the central part of the country (Mvuma, Headlands, Norton and
Marondera) and in rural communities under the rural afforestation programme.
9.2  Deforestation and land degradation
Drivers of deforestation in Zimbabwe have been increasing since 2000, when significant environmental
and land-use changes began to take root due to land conversions for crop production, grazing land, energy
uses, fire and frequent droughts. On the other hand, population increase and migration have pushed
people to areas in the vicinity of protected forests, resulting in encroachments on forest land, both planted
and natural (GIZ, 2012). The conversion of forest land for agricultural purposes, its clearing for firewood
and over-grazing by livestock, mainly goats, has impacted negatively on forest and woodland regeneration
in Zimbabwe.
Sustainable forest management and agroforestry

122
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Figure 9.1 Zimbabwean forest cover changes between 2000 and 2015

Figure 9.1 shows the change in the forested areas of Zimbabwe over a 15-year period. Degradation is not
only a human-induced environmental change, but also nature-induced, especially in regions vulnerable
to climate change and climate variability (GIZ, 2012). However, agricultural productivity and food security
can be increased while halting or even reversing deforestation by using sustainable and climate-smart
technologies such as agroforestry (Garitty et al., 2010) and conservation agriculture.
Land-use change is a driver of environmental and climate change in Zimbabwe, especially through the
expansion of agriculture, as well as economic and technological development. Increasing population
pressure in the communal areas has led to the fragmentation and degradation of forests as a result of
their clearance for agriculture and harvesting for firewood, poles and other forest products. An estimated
300,000 hectares are converted annually to arable land and other uses (NCCR, 2015). Forests and climate
change are inextricably linked, i.e., there is a relation of interdependence between forests and climate
change. The potential impacts of climate on forests include changes in the following: forest ecosystem
boundaries, growth rates, fauna and flora migration, and species growth rates, among others. Reducing
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) through sustainable forest management,
forest conservation and the enhancement of carbon stocks is seen as a major strategy for mitigating
climate change. This is discussed in Section 9.3.2.
With respect to adaptation, appropriate strategies include the adoption of land-use plans that identify
forests for bona fide land use, the injection of upfront investments for supporting adaptation endeavours
and capacity-building for pertinent forest management plans in a changing climate, as well as intensifying
climate data acquisition for Monitoring and Evaluation Reporting (MVR).
9.3  Forests and the environment
Forests provide many services, including provisioning services, regulatory services, cultural services
and support services (Table 9.2). In order to maintain these multiple roles, it is important that forests are
managed sustainably after considering key environmental factors such as soils, water and biodiversity. The
conservation and improvement of soil resources is essential to sustainable forest management, and this
can only be done practically by having a working knowledge of the composition and functions of soils and
how they are affected by forest management operations.

9.3.1  Sustainable forest management
Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) is a responsive measure for climate change mitigation and
adaptation, and also contributes to sustainable food security in a number of ways. Climate-smart forestry
requires widespread application of SFM principles and practices.  Mainstreaming climate change into
forest policy and practice will entail the identifying of synergies and managing trade-offs with other forest
management goals. SFM can provide solutions to three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Goal 2
to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture; Goal 13
to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts; and Goal 15 (see Box 9.1).

Box 9.1  Two targets under Goal 15 of SDGs support SFM
“By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt
deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation
globally” and “By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity,
in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development”.

SFM can play an important role in integrating forests into strategies for development, food security, poverty
reduction, sustainable land use and climate change mitigation and adaptation. To enhance SFM as a
responsive measure, capacity-building in remedial practices is essential if Zimbabwe is to combat climate
change effectively. This capacity-building should include integrated fire management, integrated pest and
disease management, harvest planning (including road-building), silvicultural practices and  nutrient and
water regulation.
Environmentally, SFM also contributes to carbon sequestration. There is an important relationship between
carbon storage and sequestration by forests and changing temperatures: the more carbon that is stored
in forests, the lower are CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. This relationship is gaining traction in the
climate change negotiations, as tropical countries are preparing themselves to reduce emissions through
increasing forest carbon stock so as to benefit from REDD+ issues, as described in 9.3.2.
Sustainable forest management and agroforestry

124
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
Socially, SFM also contributes to the provision of a wide range of goods, such as food, wood and fibre, and
ecosystem services, such as climate regulation, water catchment protection, poverty reduction, spiritual
fulfilment, aesthetic enjoyment, income generation, and employment.
9.3.2  Deforestation and forest degradation
The UN in 2008, set in place the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD) which is supported by FAO,
UNEP and UNDP, and provides an economic incentive for conserving and enhancing forest carbon sinks
and changing the way forest resources are used (FAO/UNDP/UNEP, 2008). This is a new way of curbing
CO2 emissions, by paying for actions that prevent forest loss or degradation. The reduced CO2 emissions
can be traded as carbon credits, while people can be paid to manage forests. UNFCCC calls for action
to reduce human pressure on forests through the development and implementation of national strategies
or action plans for “reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation plus conservation,
sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries”
(REDD+; UNFCCC, 2002: 2016).
In Zimbabwe, the biggest REDD+ project is the Kariba project, managed by Carbon Green Africa, which
covers four rural district councils (Nyaminyami, Hurungwe, Mbire and Binga) extending over 1.4 million
hectares in two provinces. To support forest conservation, communities are taught skills to increase the
productivity of land sustainably, including marketing to increase the distribution and income from crops
which in turn prevents the future clearing of forests. The potential of international strategies such as REDD+
in woodlands and savannahs can be achieved by the recovery of woodlands after clearing, since most of
the woodland species have extensive rooting systems that facilitate recovery after cutting (Shirima et al.,
2015) and are able to sequester carbon.
9.4  Agroforestry
9.4.1  Agroforestry and climate change
Agroforestry has the potential to contribute to both climate change mitigation and adaptation by sequestering
carbon and enhanc­ing resilience. To provide the ser­vices needed to combat weather extremes and
other climate change associated impacts, agroforestry, like other man­agement options in the climate
change toolbox, ought to be practised proactively. For example, in the case of trees, this means planting
several years prior to the benefits. In this regard, these practices should be able to offset lost opportunity
costs by providing non-climate change mitigation and adaptation services that are valued by farmers,
in the meanwhile. This partially constitutes agroforestry’s appeal as a climate change mitigation and
adaptation tool.
Box 9.2
Agroforestry can also be defined as a dynamic, ecologically based natural resource management
system that, through the integration of trees on farms and in agricultural landscapes or through
the production of agricultural products in forests, diversifies and sustains production for increased
economic, social and environmental benefits for land users (FAO, 2016).
The accruing agroforestry benefits (favourable micro­climates, enhanced biodiversity, providing windbreaks,
improved soil fertility, diversification of production, and reduced nutrient runoff and erosion) are the elements
that can be tagged without losing sight of the ultimate goal of combating climate change through mitigation
and adaptation. Box 9.2 gives the socio-economic and environmental benefits.

125
9.4.2  Concepts and principles of agroforestry
Agroforestry is distinguished from traditional forestry by having the additional aspect of a closely associated
agricultural or forage crop. Agroforestry systems and practices vary with the needs of different farmers, and
outcomes may also differ considerably, depending on the conditions under which agroforestry is practised.
To be called agroforestry, a land-use practice must satisfy four key criteria—the 4 I’s (Gold, et al., 2013):
••
Intentional. Combinations of trees, crops and/or animals are intentionally designed and managed
as a whole unit rather than as individual elements in order to yield multiple products and benefits;
••
Intensive. Agroforestry practices are intensively managed to maintain their productive and protective
functions. These practices often involve annual operations such as weeding, cultivation, pruning,
pollarding and fertilisation;
••
Interactive. The biological and physical interactions between the tree, crop and animal components
are actively manipulated to yield multiple products and benefits; and
••
Integrated. The tree, crop and/or animal components are structurally and functionally combined into
a single integrated management unit. Integration may be horizontal or vertical, and above or below
ground, either sequentially or simultaneously.
The economic benefits include the reduction of agricultural inputs, especially when using leguminous
species which fix nitrogen to improve soil fertility. At the same time, this maintains or increases production
and may diversify production in farming systems, for example, food, fodder, lumber, building materials and
wood fuel.
The social benefits include improvements to the health and nutrition of the rural poor. The on-farm
production of several products, often collected from off-farm sources, can reduce the time and effort needed
to obtain them, often lessening the burden on women or generating money if the products can be sold.
The environmental benefits may include a range of environmental services such as improving soil fertility,
minimising soil erosion, giving crops and livestock protection from the wind, restoring degraded lands,
and water conservation. If properly designed and managed, agroforestry systems can also contribute to
biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation and mitigation. However, if not done properly,
agroforestry can cause decreases in production because of competition among trees and crops.
9.4.3  Agroforestry systems and practices
Agroforestry has been practiced for a very long time in many parts of the world and varies from landscape
to landscape, country to country and region to region, depending on human needs and capabilities
and the prevailing environmental, cultural and socio-economic conditions. Agroforestry systems can be
classified on the basis of their dominant components into agrisilviculture, silvopasture, agrosilvopasture,
silvoagriculture, silvoagropasture, pastoral silviculture, multipurpose and other systems, such as apiculture
with trees, aqua-forestry, and mixed woodlots. The arrangement of the components can vary in space and
time (Nair, 1985; Beetz, 2011; Gold et al., 2013).
Agroforestry practices used worldwide include improved fallows (3–4 year fallow with nitrogen fixing trees/
shrubs), alley cropping (trees planted in alleys, with crops between the alleys), taungya (plantation forestry
allowing farmers to plant crops in young stands), home gardens (multi-storey structures like gardens),
growing multipurpose trees and shrubs in farmlands, boundary planting, farm woodlots, orchards and
tree gardens, tree plantations, shelterbelts, windbreaks, conservation hedges, fodder banks, live fences,
silvopastoral systems, and apiculture with trees. Examples are shown in Figs 9.2 and 9.3.

9.4.4  Agroforestry and forestry contributions to CSA
Mitigation. Trees planted in fields as live fences, windbreaks, alley cropping, fodder banks, woodlots or
improved fallows can sequester carbon in biomass and soil and supply fuelwood, poles and other forest-
based products, thus preventing the destruction of natural forests (Mbow et al., 2014). This includes actions
that increase tree cover (afforestation, reforestation and agroforestry), thus reducing deforestation and
degradation (i.e., slowing down the rate of land degradation) and thereby increasing carbon sequestration
in biomass and soil.
Box 9.3
Mitigation aims to reduce GHGs or enhance carbon sinks, while Adaptation aims to reduce the
vulnerability of people and ecosystems to climate variability and change, i.e., the degree to which they
are susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse impacts of climate.

127
Adaptation. Tree canopies have the direct benefits of reducing soil temperature for crops planted
underneath and reducing runoff velocities caused by heavy rainfall. Healthy and diverse ecosystems are
more resilient to most natural hazards. Trees on farms can be used as shelterbelts or windbreaks and play
an important role in protecting against landslides and floods. They also stabilise riverbanks and mitigates
soil erosion (Van Noordwijk et al., 2011; Mbow et al., 2014). Agroforestry also helps restore and protect
ecosystem services related to soils and watersheds due to improved management systems and better
management of biomass, including crop residues (FAO, 2010).
Forest ecosystems provide human societies with a wide range of services that reduce vulnerability to
climate change impacts, particularly changes in temperature and rainfall, and the frequency, duration and
intensity of floods and droughts. Forests regulate water and climate by sequestering CO2 (i.e., mitigation)
and also prevent soil erosion. In order for communities to continue benefitting from forest ecosystem
services, adaptation strategies must also reduce the impacts of climate change on forest growth, species
diversity and ecosystem function. Box 9.3 shows these two components of CSA.
Production. Most agroforestry systems aim to increase or maintain the productivity of farming
systems. For example, by adopting agroforestry practices on farms, farmers are able to harvest tree
products, supplement their diets, and also develop additional income streams. The Garitty et al., (2010)
report showed increased maize yields in lands with Faidherbia albida in Malawi and Zambia over low
rainfall seasons.
Forests facilitate primary production, nutrient cycling, soil formation and the provision of ecosystem
goods, such as non-timber forest products, food and fuel. Therefore, for forest activities to support CSA,
adaptation actions targeted particularly at the most vulnerable communities and sectors of the population
(e.g., women, children, the elderly, indigenous populations) and forested ecosystems (e.g., woodlands,
mountains, wetlands) are required to focus on the most efficient and cost-effective adaptation options,
in addition to capitalising on adaptation-mitigation synergies. These options should focus on sustainable
forest management and/or agroforestry.
9.5  Forestry and related activities in Zimbabwe
9.5.1  Forestry, agroforestry and climate change in Zimbabwe
The Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (ZimASSET), clearly in line with
SDG Goal 15, shows the importance of conserving natural resources. Zimbabwe’s Intended Nationally
Determined Contributions (INDC) (2015) has a target of a 33% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, to be
achieved partly through CSA. Sustainable forest management should be considered a viable solution to the
challenges within the agriculture sector, especially in respect to the use of land and other natural resources.
Forests play a key role in maintaining the quality and quantity of water supplied by watersheds such as the
Mafungabutsi forests and the gazetted forests in Matabeleland. Therefore, forested watersheds have the
potential to affect water resources. Learning from other countries such as Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda and
Kenya, farmer-managed regeneration projects have potential for REDD+ activities (Mbow et al., 2012) and
for restoration of the degraded Miombo woodlands. Drivers of deforestation must be addressed to achieve
the goals of sustainability and REDD+ (Kissinger, 2011).
Several forest-related climate change adaptation measures have been introduced in Zimbabwe (Table 9.3).

Protection of stream banks and catchment areas to improve
water quality and quantity. Forest ecosystems store water,
regulate base flows, mitigate floods and reduce runoff, erosion
and sedimentation.
Reduced agricultural yields.
Sustainable forest management, as the rural poor increase
their collection of wild foods and other products from the forest.
Agroforestry.
Outbreaks of pests and
diseases.
Selection of resistant tree and crop species.
Agriculture is the mainstay of the Zimbabwean economy and forest land is being reduced to meet the rapidly
growing demand for both agricultural and non-agricultural products. That being the case, agroforestry
becomes a viable option for CSA as it provides several benefits including carbon sequestration. As a land-
use practice, agroforestry takes care of the best land use, soil fertility and farmer needs for food, fuel, timber
and fodder and simultaneously helps sustain rural economies and the environment. However, agroforestry
systems also have limitations, and a careful analysis should be carried out before they are introduced.
9.5.2  Role of higher and tertiary institutions in climate-smart agriculture
Higher and tertiary institutions have a role to play, especially in researching suitable agroforestry species
so that recommendations can be made to farmers and extension agents. They can also facilitate capacity-
building within local institutions and strengthen the governance process for SFM and REDD+. Furthermore,
higher and tertiary institutions can facilitate understanding and training in the REDD+ process, including
issues of Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV), as communities participate in REDD+ projects
(UNEP, 2014). In addition, the university curriculum should cover the issues of climate change and SFM,
including international agreements.
There is also a need for more research on physiological adaptations of species that are able to survive
in dry conditions as well as the biodiversity of dryland forests and woodlands to use as tools to underpin
sound forest management practices. The relative neglect in respect of domesticating trees reflects the
difficulties involved in manipulating them as trees are large organisms that take up a lot of space, making
their study expensive.

129
9.5.3  Policy implications, challenges and opportunities
Forest- and tree-based resources are supported not only by local legislation, but also by regional and
international treaties and arrangements. The development and up-scaling of traditional and improved
agroforestry systems also requires an enabling environment, such as clear land and tree tenure, a
robust legal framework, support for agroforestry product value chains and coordination of the various
sectors involved.
In light of the growth of the tobacco industry, the regulations of the tobacco wood energy programme
should be strictly adhered to in order to save forests from destruction. The laws regarding fire should be
enforced at all levels. Among policy recommendations are the following:
••
Forested land and catchment areas should not be tampered with as these are the key to water
supplies and electricity generation in Zimbabwe;
••
Given the increase in tobacco farming and the clearing of indigenous woodland and forests,
farmers should be encouraged to continue planting trees for energy or seek alternative sources
of energy;
••
Ensuring adequate new investment in the energy sector, including renewable energy;
••
Improving land management practices to promote agroforestry and limit the risk of environmentally
damaging veld fires;
••
Community involvement is critical in sustainable forest management, as it also enhances
community livelihoods, involves traditional leaders and undertakes inter-sectoral collaboration to
strengthen horizontal engagements;
••
Strategic partnerships with regional and global players can provide effective environmental
management and sustainability;
••
SFM is consistent with both adaptation and mitigation, hence there is a need to consider climate
change in management plans to reduce vulnerability and to facilitate adaptation to climate change;
••
Agroforestry promotes the growing of multipurpose trees that are also palatable to livestock as
trees and shrubs are threatened by the free-range policy for livestock during off-season periods;
and
••
In areas where goats are kept, the regeneration of natural forests and any attempts at agroforestry
may not succeed unless laws are modified to protect agroforestry in rural areas.
Despite the benefits that climate-smart practices can provide, the barriers that could make farmers reluctant
to adopt these practices include a lack of:
••
technical knowledge or capacity;
••
financing, and discouragement resulting from possible short-term crop yield reductions;
••
risk management options (e.g.,  insurance), tenure insecurity, local customs and traditions; and
••
access to new information and technologies.
There is a need for coordinated policies that utilise the frameworks of the landscape approach in order
to fulfil both climate and development objectives (Matthews et al., 2014). The specific policy tools and
actions that the government should strengthen or introduce, to deal with climate change include supporting
more forestry projects under the implementation of INDCs and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions
(NAMAs), among other priority sectors. The issue of illegal settlers needs total political commitment with
implementation of land reform following strict environmental protection mechanisms.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
9.6  Conclusion and recommendations
In light of the impending climate change risks associated with global warming, this chapter has focused
on how forests, sustainable forestry management, and agroforestry in Zimbabwe can contribute to
combating climate change. It has been clearly shown that the phenomena of virgin forests, sustainable
forest management, agroforestry, and land degradation are inextricably linked to climate change mitigation
and adaptation. The chapter has also demonstrated how sustainable forest management addresses
forest degradation and deforestation while increasing the direct benefits to people, and efforts to
combat climate change. The current emphasis on increasing resilience to climate change and reducing
agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, strengthens the support for sustainable forest management and
climate-smart agriculture.
Zimbabwe is endowed with natural capital—especially forest resources, land, and a climate which can
sustain the livelihoods and economy of the people in both urban and rural areas. Degradation of the
forest resource base results from a combination of factors that have their roots in the economy, social
organisation, policy/politics and ecology. However, mounting pressures on forest resources have caused
large-scale forest and land degradation—thus calling for immediate action in seeking newer approaches
to the farming system in order to meet the basic needs of present and future generations. There is a need
for the development and implementation of sustainable forest management and agroforestry projects for
purposes of mitigating and adapting to climate change.
The destruction of forests adversely affects the livelihoods of rural communities and if it continues,
massive crowds of environmental refugees and a tremendous decline in the biological productivity of these
ecosystems will become more evident. Therefore, to improve livelihoods, the economy, and environmental
sustainability, use of improved agroforestry systems using a combination of crops, multipurpose trees and
pastures will become inevitable. Agroforestry has the potential to stabilise the production of food, forage,
firewood and timber, as well as to protect the environment. The failure to develop appropriate sustainable
natural resource management, policy and increased investment in the forest sector will increase poverty,
environmental degradation, resource-based conflict and other illegal activities. The reduction of losses in
soil fertility, the reclamation of degraded lands and the promotion of synergistic interaction between crop
production and forests are generally suggested as good climate change policies.

10. Fisheries and aquaculture in
Zimbabwe
Abstract
In the last two decades, the fisheries and aquaculture sectors have been playing a critical role in
developing food resources, combating hunger, and ensuring food security in most developing countries.
In addition, fish-farming and the nurturing and harvesting of aquaculture produce have become viable
farming alternatives for food-insecure communities. Growing demand due to increased human populations
requires corresponding increase in food and agricultural production, including aquaculture, which will need
to expand by 60% to meet increased demand. Zimbabwe is already experiencing the debilitating effects
of climate change which also threaten fisheries and aquaculture production, among other factors. It is
therefore imperative that climate-smart agriculture practices highlighted in this chapter be developed and
used to cope with the impacts of the changing environment in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors of
the country. Zimbabwe has enormous potential to develop and grow its fisheries and aquaculture, given
the good climate, vast land reserves and its huge reservoir capacity (60% of southern African waters).
However, the success of CSA in fisheries and aquaculture will require substantial technical and financial
investments in order to achieve food security and nutrition, particularly in the agro-based economy of
Zimbabwe.
Key words: aquaculture, climate-smart agriculture, fisheries, fish-farming
Key messages
i.
Fisheries production from natural fish stocks has been declining globally, regionally and nationally
(Zimbabwe) due to climate change impacts and overfishing, among other factors;
ii.
Over the last two decades, the demand for fish has increased worldwide, including Africa;
iii. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in Africa, including Zimbabwe, have increased in dimension
and can make a significant contribution towards filling the demand gap of over 260% by 2020;
iv. Relevant CSA fisheries and aquaculture systems for Zimbabwe would include research and innovation
in technologies for affordable fish feed, breeding (hatchery) equipment and techniques,  good-
quality fish fingerlings, more effective feeding mechanisms, efficient post-harvest techniques and
value addition;
v.
A robust fisheries and aquaculture sector in Zimbabwe would address nine of the 17 sustainable
development goals, namely: no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being (1-3), clean
water and sanitation (6), industry, innovation and infrastructure (9), responsible consumption and
production (12), climate action (13), life below water (14) and life on land (15); and
vi. An enabling environment for CSA in fisheries and aquaculture for Zimbabwe involves financial,
technical and policy interventions, and an integrated approach.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
10.1  Introduction
10.1.1  Global and regional overview: fisheries and aquaculture production
The global Blue Revolution (http://www.economist.com/node/1974103) which began in the 1970s as an
initiative to boost protein production to combat hunger has led to the growth and development of the
aquaculture industry. Africa is no exception to this and has recorded increased fishery development and
aquaculture production in both natural waters and specifically-constructed aquaculture production units
(Coche, 1994; Kapetsky, 1994; Agular-Manjarrez and Nath, 1998; Moehl et al., 2006). Compared to capture
fisheries which are estimated to have reached their peak and are now recording decreasing production
generally, aquaculture is currently recognised as the fastest and economically sustainable food producing
sector in the world, growing at an annual rate of ten percent in Africa (FAO, 2014 http://www.iafi.net/
Resources/Documents/5%20Iddya%20Karybasagar%20for%20Lahsen%20Ababouch%20Keynote%20
Oct01.pdf. The development of aquaculture fits well into the CSA narrative, particularly when practiced in
smaller and intensive units in the tropics as opposed to its extensive use in the oceans which has been
associated with environmental destruction and degradation (https://newint.org/features/1992/08/05/blue).
Africa has a long history of fisheries and traditionally, the fisheries industry has been based on natural
fish stocks. In the past two to three decades, and concordant with global trends, these stocks have been
declining due to a myriad of factors, including over-harvesting,  climate change and variability, and changes
in land use and cover, among other factors, thus leading to increased pressure on fisheries (Ndebele-
Murisa et al., 2010; Ndebele-Murisa, 2014). Classic examples of declining fisheries in the continent include
those from Lakes Kariba, Malawi, Tanganyika and Victoria. In addition, depletion of fish stocks due to illegal
and unregulated fishing in the coastal zones and oceans surrounding the continent have also been noted.
While it is still modest, African aquaculture production has entered a steady phase of expansion (Jamu and
Aynla, 2003). Historically, the first instance of aquaculture dates back to 2,500 years ago when Egyptians are
recorded to have farmed tilapia fish in ponds adjacent to the Nile River (Rural Fisheries Programme, 2010).
Although the Nile Tilapia, locally known as ‘bream’ may have been grown thousands of years ago, there is
little tradition of fish culture in most African countries (Bardach et al., 1974; Ridler and Hishamunda, 2001).
Though aquaculture exists in varying degrees to many farming regions, when coupled with other factors
such as severe political and socio-economic constraints and a changing climate, as well as pressure
exerted on fisheries due to population expansion (Ndebele-Murisa et al., 2017), the result is a small
fisheries sector that makes only a small contribution to food security and economic development.
In 2008, nearly 10 million people, or 1.5% of Africa’s population were directly or indirectly dependant on
fish-farming with the continent realising about USD 3 billion from exports annually (AfDB, 2008). The
reported production of 121,905 tonnes in 1997 is more than three times that of the 36,685 tonnes reported
by FAO in 1984.  By 2014 (three decades later), the global per capita fish supply rate had risen to a record
breaking 20 kg per person. In 2014, Africa produced a total yield of 1.7 million tonnes of fish out of a total
73.7 million tonnes of global production, with an estimated value of about USD 160.2 billion (FAO, 2016a,
http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5555e.pdf), with fish from aquaculture contributing 44.1%, rising from 31.1% of
the total global fish production realised in 2004. As of 2016, aquaculture was providing half of all the
fish consumed by humans (FAO, 2016a). Currently, over 26 species of fish are utilised in aquaculture
production in Africa, of which Tilapia, Catfish, and the common carp are more predominant. Molluscs as
well as oysters are also bred in the coastal zones.
Concerns over the future of fisheries and aquaculture resources arise from the threats posed to natural
fish stocks by illegal harvesting done in unsustainable ways, as well as by climate change, among other
factors (Ndebele-Murisa et al., 2010; Hecky et al., 2010; Ndebele-Murisa, 2014; IPCC, 2007, 2013, 2014;
Oguto-Ohwayo et al., 2016; Efitre et al., 2017). This has driven investment into fish farming practices, as

135
well as policies being developed especially for poor communities in arid environments as a sustainable
livelihood measure and ultimately, poverty eradication. However, this is not without drawbacks. Most rural
households operate outside the cash economy, with some rural communities in arid Zimbabwe still relying
on barter trade and thus have little disposable income with which to purchase feed and fertiliser that make
aquaculture an economically viable trade. This has seen many donor organisations and in particular, the
African Development Bank (AfDB) venturing into fisheries and aquaculture in Africa in a bid to minimise the
threats posed by the over-exploitation of natural fish stocks, and aid in value addition, poverty eradication
through job creation and enhancement of sustainable livelihoods, among others. In Zimbabwe, for example,
the AfDB has supported the largest fish-farm, Lake Harvest (AfDB, 2011).
10.1.2  Fisheries and aquaculture production in Zimbabwe
In this chapter, aquaculture (which is used interchangeably with ‘fish farming’), is defined as the breeding,
rearing and harvesting of aquatic organisms (includes both animals and plants) under controlled or semi-
controlled conditions while fisheries are defined as natural, often open aquatic ecosystems (known as
‘capture’ fisheries). Both yield produce for subsistence, and hold commercial, recreational and ornamental
value. According to the Japanese Resource Council, Science and Technology Agency, aquaculture is
defined as, “… an industrial process of raising aquatic organisms up to final commercial production within
properly partitioned aquatic areas, controlling the environmental factors and administering the life history
of the organism positively and thus is considered as an independent industry from the fisheries hitherto.”
In our context, these definitions are used with a bias towards fish production as this is the most common
produce among other aquatic organisms such as crabs, crocodiles, crayfish, freshwater shrimp, and algae
in Zimbabwe. Being landlocked, only freshwater aquaculture can be practised in the country, as opposed
to marine and brackish water aquaculture.
Zimbabwe relies on animal husbandry as its main protein source. A growing awareness that capture fisheries
are reaching a peak (Ndebele-Murisa et al. 2011) has seen a rise in aquaculture production (www.herald.
co.zw/fish-farming-coprehensive-aquaculture-policy-in-zim/). Health consciousness, with a preference for
white over red meat has also increased demand for fish, which is also a cheaper source of protein thus
driving aquaculture production. Despite being landlocked, Zimbabwe, like many African countries, has
the desired climatic conditions for fresh water fish farming and the potential to develop aquaculture in
sustaining livelihoods (especially of the rural majority), food security and economic development through
value addition and export of fish and fish products (Jamu and Ayinla, 2003). According to the Zimbabwe
National Parks and Wildlife Authority, if all of Zimbabwe’s 41 major reservoirs were fully utilised there is
potential to increase fish production output up to 1.5 million tonnes, supporting 1.2 million people at the
primary production level. The country has one of the largest fish farming operations in Africa that produces
over 9,000 tonnes of Nile Tilapia per year. Zimbabwe holds an estimated 60 percent of all dammed water in
the Southern Africa Development Community region, i.e., close to 10,000 dams and produced over 18,000
tonnes of fish in 2014 (Table 10.1), which has since risen to over 21,000 tonnes against an estimated
demand of 60,000 tonnes per year (UNDESA, 2013, FAO, 2017).
The fishery sector in Zimbabwe comprises capture fisheries, aquaculture, recreational fisheries and a very
limited ornamental fish selection (www.fao.org/fishery/facp/ZWE/en). About 114 indigenous fish species
and an additional 30 exotic species are exploited, but only a few species (about six) have been used for
aquaculture production (FAO, 2016b). Despite this wide variety of fish being produced in Zimbabwe, two
species, Nile Tilapia ‘bream’ (Oreochromis niloticus) and the freshwater Tanganyika sardine, commonly
known as ‘Kapenta’, are the most commercially preferred fish and they contribute significantly to fish
production in Zimbabwe (FAO, 2003, 2007, 2016b). Rainbow trout (Onchorynchus mykiss) is also produced
in the Eastern Highlands, generally for the urban up-markets and for recreational fishing. Fisheries from
Lake Kariba are the mainstay of the fishery sector, with large aquaculture farms such as Lake Harvest and
Kariba Bream contributing significantly to fish production. Commercial fishing across the country occurs

mainly in the large reservoirs such as Lakes Kariba, Chivero, Mutirikwi, Manyame and Mazvikadei. Smaller
dams, rivers and ponds provide fish for subsistence purposes (FAO, 2017).

10.1.3  Recreational fishing
Recreational fishing is carried out in most of the reservoirs that qualify as recreational parks under the
Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZPWMA). Anglers are not regulated closely except
for the issuing of licences for fishing in reservoirs within park estates or for trout fishing in the Eastern
Highlands. Subsistence angling is a common activity in all reservoirs near urban centres, mainly Lakes
Chivero, Manyame and Kariba (ZPWMA, 2017). Sport fishing for trout is carried out in reservoirs and rivers
in Nyanga National Park in the Eastern Highlands and the Manyame, Mutirikwi, Manyuchi, Manjirenji,
Matopos, Muzhwi, Ncema, Osborne, Mayfair and Zhowe dams, are other reservoirs supporting fisheries,
with gillnet and seine net being the dominant gear in use (FAO, 2017; Katunga, 2016). Sport fishing for

137
tiger fish (Hydrocynus vittatus) is also permissible in Lake Kariba, and the annual Kariba International Tiger
Fishing Tournament brings in substantial revenue for the country (http://www.worldlakes.org/uploads/14_
Kariba_Reservoir_27February2006.pdf).
10.1.4  Aquaculture production
Aquaculture production in Zimbabwe is conducted for subsistence and commercial purposes. Subsistence
aquaculture occurs at household level and is generally limited to a few pond-based enterprises. There are
also a few donor-driven projects which aim to boost aquaculture and fish-farming across rural districts and
sustain the livelihoods of rural communities in the arid parts of the country. For example, a donor-driven
project led by World Vision International-Zimbabwe in partnership with Aquaculture Zimbabwe and the
Basilizwi Trust is currently running in Zimbabwe. The project is funded by the European Union (EU) and
focuses on enhancing fish-farming by promoting the untapped aquaculture sector in Zimbabwe which
has great potential to improve food security as a diversified livelihood strategy under changing climatic
conditions (Gumbo, 2015). The three implementing partners have the project running in eight selected
districts (Beitbridge, Binga, Hwange, Kariba, Insiza, Masvingo, Mwenezi and Umzingwane) across the
country. However, these efforts are not without challenges as climate change, explosive population growth
and the consequent overharvesting and degradation of water resources, among other factors are still to
be overcome. Commercial aquaculture enterprises in the country vary from small- to large-scale of which
the following farms—Lake Harvest Aquaculture Pvt Ltd, Kariba Bream Farm, Mazvikadei Fish Farm, Trout
Farm, Inn on the Ruparara Farm, Clairmont Trout Farm, and Radco Timber Farm stand out as large-scale.
10.1.5  Types of aquaculture
Determining the type of culture to practice is dependent on a number of factors, for example, intensity of
culture, level of water exchange, structures used, type of fish, and climate. Zimbabwe’s climate provides a
favourable environment for both capture and aquaculture fisheries production. Aquaculture can be broadly
categorised into extensive, intensive and semi-intensive. Extensive aquaculture is a low skilled practice
that involves the use of large stagnant ponds that only allows a limited number of stock receiving no
supplementary feed, and minimal attention. Extensive fisheries and aquaculture programmes have been
developed in Zimbabwe within dams and reservoirs such as Chivero, Kariba, Mazvikadei and Mutirikwi
- deriving secondary functions of commercial fisheries. On the other hand, semi-intensive aquaculture
requires a certain level of managerial skills and a much greater extent of intervention through supplementary
feed or water quality and air circulation systems. It also  tends to bear higher costs in setting up as well as
operations, with higher risks of mortalities because of diseases, poor management, and/or force majeure.
(FAO, 2017). Semi-intensive aquaculture systems have intermediator conditions between extensive and
intensive aquaculture.
Despite being more technical than extensive and semi-intensive culture systems, intensive aquaculture is
advocated for Zimbabwe in order to boost production. Intensive aquaculture relies on electricity to operate
and solely depends on supplementary feed to sustain the high stock rates while using a rather small space
in an efficient manner. Continuously flowing water is used in intensive aquaculture which is advantageous
for fish culture as it supplies abundant dissolved oxygen and flushes away waste products and unconsumed
feeds. Examples of intensive and commercial aquaculture ventures in Zimbabwe include Lake Harvest
Aquaculture, and Kariba Bream, both located in Kariba. The fish aquaculture types practiced in Zimbabwe
include open cage fish farming, open and closed recirculating systems and pond (mostly earthen) and
tank-based fish farming. These are described in detail in the context of CSA in ensuing sections.
10.2  Need for climate-smart agriculture in fisheries and aquaculture
In a bid to successfully tackle current food security and climate change challenges, the adoption of CSA
practices is essential. These practices increase productivity, enhances livelihood resilience and reduce
Fisheries and aquaculture in Zimbabwe

138
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
greenhouse gases (www.fao.org/3/a-an177epdf&ved=0ahU). The rural and less economically viable
communities in Zimbabwe that practise fisheries and aquaculture either use equipment such as cages and
nets provided by donor organisations or self-sustaining fish ponds that grow tilapia at varying scales. Climate
change and variability in the form of erratic rainfall patterns and increases in temperature negatively affect
fisheries and aquaculture production, livelihoods and ultimately the economy. Tilapia is a better option for
fish farming under unpredictable climatic conditions as they are generally more resilient and can tolerate
a wider range of tropical high temperatures (https://ccafs.cgiiar.org/news/swimming-towards-adaptation-
climate-smart-aquaculture#.WXxi58vRbqa). Given the historical trends of increasing temperatures and
more erratic rainfall patterns across the country - especially in Natural regions III to IV (Mugandani et al.,
2012; Ndebele-Murisa and Mubaya, 2015; Brazier, 2015), aquaculture works well as a strategy for coping
with and adopting to climate change and variability, and consequent increased aridity as it requires less
water for fish production as compared to the production of crops and livestock. Having a robust fisheries
and aquaculture sector in Zimbabwe would address nine out of the 17 sustainable development goals,
namely: no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being (1-3), clean water and sanitation (6), industry,
innovation and infrastructure (9), responsible consumption and production (12), climate action (13), life
below water (14) and life on land (15).
There exists great potential for the development of aquaculture in Zimbabwe given the large tracts of
land as well as good weather that can suit the breeding of various fish and other aquaculture species
(Mandima, 1994 and 1995). The recent recurrent droughts in southern Africa, Zimbabwe included (Sithole
and Murewi, 2009), have also had a toll on livestock production, which coupled with frequent outbreaks of
anthrax and foot and mouth disease, have seen a sharp decline in beef and dairy production, as well as
the banning of beef exports to the EU (Chingono, 2014, Mukaro, 2016). Thus, beef prices continue to rise
in Zimbabwe, and many consumers have switched to poultry consumption over the past decade. Analysis
of meat prices in Zimbabwe (Livestock and Meats Advisory Council) shows that, on average, beef and
chicken cost US$5-6 per kg and pork US$4.50 per kg in comparison with fish which costs US$2.50-3.50
per kg. The vast difference in prices between livestock and fish has aided in increasing the demand for the
cheaper protein source.
10.2.1  Current aquaculture systems in Zimbabwe
10.2.1.1  Pond culture
Pond culture is the most common form of aquaculture in Zimbabwe. It can be divided into static and
flowing water ponds, of which the latter are more suitable to highlands with flowing and good supplies of
water. Ponds vary in form from simple earthen ones to reinforced ones (cement, plastic) and can be raised
(watershed) or dug on flat ground (excavated) or drawn from reservoirs with raised sides (levee) (Whitis,
2002; Egna and Boyd, 1997). Ponds may be designed in such a way that they can be rain-fed (sky ponds)
and/or may have inlet and outlet systems for controlled water circulation. The water supply may be from a
stream or a canal or from underground sources such as wells. The water retentivity of the ponds depends
on soil composition of the pond bottom and subsoil water level. The sandier, the soil, the less likely it is to
retain water in the pond system. In order to enhance production, pond aquaculture systems may require
liming (to balance the water pH), application of manure and/or fertilisers (based on pond soil and water
quality), stocking of fingerlings, regular supplementary feeding of fish, and harvesting of fish at the right
time. Most of the training and capacity building of aquaculture in Zimbabwe is currently based on pond
culture as it is a simple form of production which is cost-effective. This is suitable for a suite of purposes
from subsistence to commercial; small to medium and large (intensive) scale with pond design, stocking
and feeding mechanisms applied accordingly (http://articles.extension.org/pages/58771/pond-culture). In
rare cases, such as in larger aquaculture ventures, fish breeding is being practised while smaller and
donor-driven operations rely on external sources for fish fry (see section 10.3.3). This addresses the issue
of sustainability of aquaculture for the local farmer, as ensuring good quality seed (fry) is important for

139
successful fish production and this could be one area of research, development, and training for extension
services and smallholder farmers in the country in order to boost aquaculture production.
10.2.1.2  Tanks
Earthen, polythene, galvanised steel, fibre glass, and concrete tanks can be placed along the course
of a river or stream or on any land surface to be used for aquaculture. These materials are used in the
construction of tanks because they do not easily become contaminated with poison or other toxic materials.
Tanks come in various shapes and sizes (http://www.farmB.com/aquaponics/aquaculture-tank) and are
easy and relatively cheap to maintain. Tanks are closed aquaculture systems and are therefore similar to
ponds in their operation. They can be operated indoors or outdoors (http://www.aquacare.com/products/
fish-farming-tanks/). The difference between ponds and tanks is that tanks are constructed above ground
but can be made to ‘interact’ with soil at the bottom. Often used for research and training purposes,
conditions in the tanks can be controlled and activities such as fertilisation, supplementary feeding and
stocking are essential. The harvesting of fish is easy in these aquaculture systems. Tanks are not popular
in Zimbabwe but are used for hatchery purposes with an example of them at Radco Timber Farm in
Bindura in the form of small tubs that are used to grow fry. However, tanks are one form of aquaculture
which can be widespread in Zimbabwe due to the advantages associated with closed aquaculture systems
as they can grow more fish with less feed, less water and less stress as compared to other closed systems.
However, unlike raceways (see section) 10.2.1.4, there is need for enhanced aeration and the water to be
cleaned regularly to avoid contamination and pollution.
10.2.1.3  Pen and cage culture
Basic procedures involved in the management of pen and cage culture are very much like those in pond
and tank cultures. These involve construction and preparation of the culture facilities for stocking, rearing,
and harvesting although some variations are to be expected. However, pens and cages, which can be
floating or submerged in flowing (rivers, streams, estuaries, seas) or stagnant waters (lakes, reservoirs,
large ponds) are open systems and are subject to less control than ponds and tanks, therefore, fertilisation,
liming and the application of pesticides is not possible. The advantage of cage culture as compared to pen
culture may be due to its greater flexibility in terms of siting the structures. Yields from pen and cage culture
are generally high, with or without supplemental feeding depending on the natural productivity of the water
body. Disadvantages of pen/cage culture include: the fact that they are difficult to handle when water is
rough; high dependence on artificial feeding and need for high quality feed in the form of protein, vitamins
and minerals; high levels of feed losses are recorded because of the open cage walls which also mean
that there is interference with natural fish populations around the pens/cages; and lastly, there is a high
risk of theft. Examples of cage culture in Zimbabwe include grow out cages set up by private enterprises
in Kariba, Karoi and Zhohwe Dams. Though few, these have been successful as commercial ventures
and with increased capital, cage culture can be increased across the country given the high number of
reservoirs that the country possesses.
10.2.1.4  Raceways
Raceways are culture chambers that are generally long and narrow through which water flows and
therefore provide good aeration and oxygen conditions. Unlike tanks that are a closed system, water
enters at one end and leaves through the other end in most cases. The advantages of tanks and raceways
is that they are closed aquaculture systems and therefore there is no water exchange with the environment
and the water can be subject to extensive treatment where high densities of organisms can be bred. In
this case the farmer has complete control over growing conditions where conditions such as temperature
can be regulated, parasites or predators controlled, and harvesting is simple. In addition, feed and drugs
can be administered efficiently into the system which enables the fish to grow quickly and uniformly. One
disadvantage, like in most closed system is the risk of disease outbreak which can easily spread and affect
Fisheries and aquaculture in Zimbabwe

140
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
large populations especially under intensive, high density culture. Raceways are not practiced widely in
Zimbabwe. Examples of raceways are found at Kariba Bream which breeds the Nile Tilapia. Like cages,
raceways can be encouraged as a form of aquaculture in Zimbabwe as they have been successfully used
in some places in Europe, to boost aquaculture production.
10.2.1.5  Recirculation aquaculture systems
In Recirculation Aquaculture Systems (RAS), a large amount of high-quality fish can be grown using a
small amount of water which is re-used or re-circulated. The water conservation and reuse aspect of RAS
is important as a CSA approach.
In addition, a properly functioning recirculation system aerates the water, adding oxygen and conversely
removing carbon dioxide, as well as the ammonia that fish excrete as a by-product of the catabolism of
protein (Figure 10.1). This helps create good water quality conditions which in turn, boost production.
However, because of the high costs involved in setting up a RAS, only a handful of operators in Zimbabwe
have managed to acquire this facility. A RAS can be run inside a greenhouse to ensure warm water
temperature throughout the growing cycle. Home-made biofilters are effective in purifying the water before
it can be recycled. Cheap materials such as wood chips and wheat straw have been shown to be more
effective biofilters than the traditional plastic media (Saliling et al., 2007).

10.2.1.6  Integrated aquaculture system
If sustainability is to be achieved, particularly under the projected warmer and increased arid conditions,
food production systems should be integrated in ways that allow sequential linkages between different
farming activities for efficient use of available scarce resources (Little et al., 2003). The integrated
aquaculture system is a sustainable way to address environmental scarcities which manifests in different
forms such as land shortages, financial stresses and various socio-economic constraints (http://www.
mekarn.org/workshops/environ/PDF/Lindberg). It entails production of fish, crops and other livestock
within a coordinated framework in which one production benefits from the other (Land based aquaculture
assessment framework, 2017). This system has been in practice for over 1,500 years in countries such as
India and China.
Given the scarcity of water resources, in part due to climate change and variability, integrated aquaculture
becomes the best practice to use resources efficiently. In fact, integrated aquaculture is regarded as
an alternative for efficient use of resources, water recycling, and energy saving (www.researchgate.
net/publication/226829080_Integrated_Agri-Aquaculture_Systems). The cost effectiveness of using

141
wastewater is also another advantage of this practice. While aquaculture is an important source of fish
stock, employment and profits, it also presents ecological, environmental and socio-economic challenges.
On the other hand, integrated aquaculture not only has minimum environmental impacts, but also increases
productivity (Angel and Freeman, 2009). However, this practice requires good management to balance
between inputs and nutrient flows (www.lbaaf.co.nz/land-based-aquaculture/integrated-aquaculture/). It
is important to note public health considerations and concerns (www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/FCIT/
Meetings/World_Water_Day_2011/5) when using wastewater for agricultural production (http://www.who.
int/water_sanitation_health/wastewater/Volume3_v2.pdf). In Zimbabwe, such concerns would fall under the
jurisdiction of regulatory authorities such as the Environmental Management Authority (EMA), Zimbabwe
National Water Authority (ZINWA) and the Standards Association of Zimbabwe (SAZ).
Integrated aquaculture involves the concurrent or sequential linkages of two or more activities, of which
at least one is fish-farming. These may occur directly on-site or indirectly through off-site needs and
opportunities. The benefits of integration are synergistic rather than additive (Little et al., 2003) and the fish,
crops and livestock components may benefit to varying degrees. In an integrated system, fish, livestock
and crops are produced within a coordinated framework, the waste products of one component serving
as a resource for the other. For example, manure from livestock and/or poultry production can be used
to enhance crop production, crop residues and by-products feed fish and animals, supplementing often
inadequate feed supplies, thus contributing to improved fish, crop and animal nutrition and productivity
(Figure 10.2).
Figure 10.2  An illustration of an integrated agri-aquaculture system
Source: Dumont et al., 2013 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23257276
The production and processing of livestock and crops generate by-products that can be used for fish-
farming. Direct use of livestock production waste is the most widespread and conventionally recognised
type of integrated farming. Production wastes include manure, urine and spilled feed, which may be used
as fresh inputs or be processed in some way before use. Water from fish ponds is rich in nutrients and
is therefore used to irrigate crops, thus completing the cycle. An example of an integrated aquaculture
programme which covers Hwange and Binga Districts is the EU-funded programme which was launched
in 2013, in partnership with the Basilwizi Trust, World Vision and Aquaculture Zimbabwe. In Hwange the
project is working with capture fisheries, and in Binga District both capture fisheries and aquaculture are
being implemented (http://www.basilwizi.org/basilwizi/projects/intergrated-aquaculture-agriculture-project).

10.2.1.7  Aquaponics
Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture and hydroponics (the soil-less growing of plants such
as crops and vegetables)—that is, growing fish and plants together in one integrated farming system
(Figure 10.3). This integrated approach to farming has been used since time immemorial especially by the
Chinampas of Mexico and in integrated paddy systems across parts of Asia (see: https://www.milkwood.
net/2014/01/20/aquaponics-a-brief-history/). It is currently, highly acclaimed particularly when used with
renewable energy sources such as solar. Environmentally friendly organic waste is circulated and used to
fertilise each component thus producing minimal waste http://www.dw.com/en/sustainable-farming-project-
combines-aquaculture-and-hydroponics/a-16927582. The waste from the fish ponds provides an organic
food source for the growing of plants. The plants provide a natural filter for the water the fish live in. Like
the integrated aquaculture system, aquaponics is a technology that is ideal for intensive commercial and
non-commercial aquaculture setups with the advantages of efficiency in water usage and conservation
(Gith, 2013, Bradeley, 2014).
Figure 10.3  How aquaponics work
Source: Ecolife (https://www.ecolifeconservation.org/aquaponics/)
The hydroponics technology works well for CSA because of the water conservation and farm integration
advantages as well as being a potentially more sustainable method of food production that uses 90%
less water and soil as compared to traditional agricultural methods of production (Diver, 2006; Rakocy et
al., 2006; Love et al., 2014; and (https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/viewhtml.php?id=56). Aquaponic systems
are beneficial in many ways which include the use of dissolved waste nutrients by plants, reduced waste
discharge, minimal water exchange and reduced operational costs particularly in arid environments. In
addition, these systems require substantially less water quality monitoring as compared to standalone
hydroponics or RAS. Because of its integrated nature, fish production through aquaponics requires less
land. Aquaponic systems require moderate capital investment, energy inputs and skilled management.
This method of aquaculture production has not been explored to a large extent in Zimbabwe despite
its suitability under CSA due to its soil and water conservation characteristics as well as its potential for
high productivity. However, the higher maintenance and costs associated with the setup, especially at
commercial scale, in comparison to other aquaculture methods may be viewed as disadvantageous.
10.2.1.8  Breeding and hatchery technologies
A hatchery is a place for artificial breeding, hatching, and rearing through the early life stages of animals
(Crespi and Coche, 2008). Proper site selection determines the success of a hatchery. This entails that

143
the site should be at close proximity to the market so as to minimise transport costs. The water should be
oxygen rich, of good quality, with optimum temperatures which is essential for successful spawning and
hatching. The first step in artificial reproduction is selection of females from broodstock and then their
transfer to the holding tanks within a hatchery. The most common technique employed to induce final
maturation and ovulation is to inject the female with hormones or pituitary gland material (http://www.
nefisco.org/downloads/Clarias). Ponds should be protected against predators such as birds by using bird-
netting and by low walls to keep out frogs. The ponds should also be inaccessible to wild fish. For southern
Africa, the recommended breeding span for broodstock is 3-4 years. Trout are usually ineffective breeders
after 2-3 years as they are a short-lived species. For breeding techniques for different types of fish see:
http://www.nda.agric.za/doaDev/sideMenu/fisheries/03_areasofwork/Aquaculture/AquaDocumentation/
ManualRuralFreshwaterAquaculture.pdf.
Developing hatcheries can be considered as a CSA activity in terms of increasing productivity, ensuring
good quality and reliable aquaculture seed, and therefore enhanced production. In a country whose
agriculture is currently rain-dependant, any enhancement of production that is not directly controlled by
nature (rain-dependant) can help farmers to combat and cope with adverse impacts of climate changes
and variability. To breed a species, one needs to know if the fish is a pair, hence determining the sex of the
fish is an important step. Once males and females have been distinguished, a suitable pair or spawning
group should be chosen. Before placing the parent fish together for spawning, they should be conditioned
by feeding the fish a variety of healthy foods to bring them to the best condition for spawning. Many species
can be conditioned using well-balanced flake food, although others can be conditioned on live foods such
as insect larvae and flying insects. Currently, aquaculture companies in Zimbabwe have been breeding for
in-house stocking with just a handful producing seed for sale (FAO, 2017).
Though some species readily spawn in an aquarium, the eggs or fry often do not survive because of
predatory parents or other fish. Often the fry die because of unfavourable and/or unclean water conditions.
Many species that practice brood care will harm other tank mates in attempting to guard the eggs. Because
of these issues, most aquarists who breed fish use separate spawning tanks. The spawning tank should
be like a hospital tank with a protected heater so that the fish are not burnt, a slow-moving filter (sponge
filter) so that the eggs or fry are not sucked up, and also have good aeration. In Zimbabwe, a number of
fish breeding centres and hatcheries have been developed by both government (Ministry of Agriculture,
Mechanisation and Irrigation Development; Zimbabwe National Parks; and Wildlife Management Authority)
and private actors such as Lake Harvest and Kariba Bream in Kariba as well as Radco Timber Fish
Farm in Bindura. The Zimbabwean government fish breeding structures, namely the Henderson Research
Centre and Chivero Hatchery are dilapidated as they were largely driven by donor funding which has since
dwindled while the private players are mostly producing fingerlings for their own production or to sell to a
few non-governmental aquaculture projects. This presents an opportunity to develop breeding technologies
and aquaculture hatcheries that can be used to grow the aquaculture sector as well as boost natural
fishery stocks.
10.2.1.9  Farm equipment and feed
This represents an important component of fisheries and aquaculture research and development. If these
sectors are to be grown and developed successfully in the context of CSA, there is need to develop
appropriate equipment and feed. Equipment requirements largely depend on the type of rearing to be done
and the level of production envisaged. The following considerations are essential:
i.
Pumping: In addition, to a reliable water source, there is need to ensure that water is supplied to
the aquaculture facility. When it is not possible to have a gravity water supply, pumping needs to be
studied.
ii.
Harvesting: This component of the fishery and aquaculture production is very important. This
is because there is need to handle the produce with much care in order to prevent harvesting
Fisheries and aquaculture in Zimbabwe

144
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
and post-harvest losses. There are several methods that can be used for harvesting and in open
fisheries these include different types of netting, hook and line, seining with a reed fence or basket
trapping. In ponds and tanks, the most efficient method is drainage of water down to 20-30% level
and subsequent seine netting. This yields an average 80% at the first attempt after which the water
can be further drained in order to harvest the rest of the fish. In the case of controlled environments
such as cages and RAS as well as aquaponics, the main advantage is that complete harvest of the
fish can be done.
iii.	 Aeration: This is essential in order to allow oxygen to diffuse from the atmosphere and dissolve in
the water as this is the form in which it can be assimilated by fish and other aquaculture animals.
Aeration can be natural (wind) but if the production of the farm is to be successful, there is need
to invest in aeration equipment (see: http://pentairaes.com/media/docs/03-PAES-Master-Catalog-
39th-Edition-Aeration.pdf). In this way, air can be infused from the bottom of the water or by surface
agitation from a fountain or spray-like device to allow for oxygen exchange at the surface. There
are two main aeration systems. One is aeration by pulsed air, in which a blower generates air at
relatively low pressure through the pipe to air stones or other diffusers. This system is particularly
well adapted to small-scale facilities and for fry and small fish, since it does not cause damage due
to water turbulence. The second is aeration by mechanical agitation. This has different aerators
(fountain aerator, paddlewheel and Venturi system), and these are more suitable to large-scale
aquaculture facilities where stocking densities are high.
iv.	 Fish graders: These are used to grade the fish and separate them according to their individual sizes.
This operation is very important because it allows a dramatic improvement in growth performance
and improves the overall management of the farm’s facilities. If the fish are not graded properly, the
smallest ones have difficulty in gaining access to the food (due to physical competition with larger
fish) and are stressed, resulting in poor growth performance.
v.
Complementary equipment: These include general equipment such as water quality measuring
meters. A daily check of temperature and oxygen is essential and is an integral part of the fish-farm’s
management.
vi.	 Feeding: manual or using machinery: Providing fish with a nutritionally balanced diet is essential
to grow a healthy stock of fish. In fish-farming, the variety of fish feed must be carefully considered
because feed represents 70% of the production cost.  Processed feeds are formulated to meet the
basic nutritional requirements of fish. Quality fish feeds also need to be supplied to supplement
essential nutrients, vitamins and minerals, making processed feed a convenient source of staple
food for most farm-raised and aquarium fish. Processed dry feed includes flake, tablet, pellet and
crumb forms. These feed types come in many different sizes to incorporate all types of fish. Some dry
feeds are designed to float, while others are designed to sink to accomodate bottom feeders. Live
fish food is an exceptionally good source of fish food. Feeding live food is necessary for fish with
specialised needs, as in the case of many carnivorous fish, wild specimens and fry. Not only does
live food mimic the feeding habits of fish in their natural environment, it can also provide many
benefits that commercial feeds have not been able to replicate to this day.
10.3  Climate-smart agriculture practices in fisheries and aquaculture
Although it has been widely recognised that some fishery and aquaculture practices can have negative
impacts on the environment, at the same time they also have some positive spin-offs towards environmental
sustainability. Such environmentally sensitive practices should also be done being cognisant of the changing
climate and climate variability to ensure sustained livelihoods. Aquaculture and fisheries best practices
have minimum impacts to the environment, low GHG emissions and consume low amounts of water. Such
practices promote innovation to reduce post-harvest losses. GHGs from fisheries and aquaculture can be
reduced by improving fuel efficiency and reducing travel distance by increasing consumption closer to the
source. CSA practices for fisheries and aquaculture are quite similar to other sectors such as agriculture
and forestry. For instance, water harvesting technologies can also be employed and water then can

145
become available for aquaculture throughout the year. While the preceding section highlighted the current
aquaculture systems in Zimbabwe, the changing environment requires innovations and technologies in
CSA that enhance fish production in both capture fisheries and aquaculture. Such practices may include
focus on the following research and development:
10.3.1  Fish feeds and fingerlings
Stock feeds gobble up 70% of the costs of aquaculture production. Currently, there is only one known
commercial supplier of fish stock feed in Zimbabwe, Aquafeeds, which operates as part of the Profeeds
Company (although Lake Harvest, the largest aquaculture producer in Zimbabwe supplies its local
operations from its own plant in Uganda). As a result, there is no competition or incentives that could help
reduce costs, and operating costs for aquaculture operators in Zimbabwe are quite high. Thus, approaches
which can reduce costs would be beneficial. Research and development on fish-stock products that can
provide essential trace minerals, as well as protein and fat at a reduced cost are vital if aquaculture feed
stock costs are to be reduced. Such research could concentrate on developing various options to enhance
feed stocks and could also include the use of locally available inputs such as maggots from domestic waste,
Kikuyu grass, breeding insects and other invertebrates (which are high in both protein and fat content) for
feed. This would ensure that fish stock feeds of various qualities and value are made available to farmers.
This is crucial if aquaculture is to expand to become a substantial contributor of fish and protein in the
country. Other methods that have been tried elsewhere and can be investigated and used for fish stocks in
Zimbabwe include the use of natural products such as manure, crop/plant residues and enhanced algal and
plankton production. Research can also be carried out on how to improve the quality of fingerlings coupled
with cost-effective fish feeds. Better feeds and feeding practices that are more ecosystem friendly need to
be adopted http://www.cfuzim.org/index.php/agriculture/8568-fish-farming-and-aquaculture-policy-in-zim.
10.3.2  Providing more effective and less wasteful feeding mechanisms
One of the problems plaguing fish-farmers in Zimbabwe is the wastage of food during the feeding of the
fish. In addition, as the fish jostle for the food, they end up hurting each other, causing reductions in the
productivity of the fish to some extent. There is therefore a need to devise better feeding mechanisms for a
host of different fish farming methods. These can include the use of automated systems for multi-sensing
and the analysis of water quality parameters interfaced with automatic controls to detect and regulate
conditions to optimise the aquaculture environment, including feeding mechanisms in aquaculture ponds.
10.3.3  Pond and hatchery design and stocking
This is related to the feeding problems highlighted in the preceding section. There is a need to investigate
the most effective designs of ponds, hatcheries and tanks that can house fish at different stages of
development, including fingerlings and juvenile fish. This refers to issues of water environment, quality and
quantity, fish-stocking densities, and ensuring optimum conditions for fish growth and development. http://
www.fao.org/docrep/t8598e/t8598e05.htm. It is envisaged that varying designs and a suite of ponds and
cages for housing fish can include ponds, tubs, tanks and raceways for use in different environments http://
www.fao.org/docrep/t8598e/t8598e05.htm.
10.3.4  Post-harvest techniques and value addition
If fisheries and aquaculture production are to be enhanced in Zimbabwe, there is a need to develop
smart post-harvest and value addition techniques. These may include such processes as deboning and
packaging, freezing, and training on managing and maintaining equipment and operations. The techniques
may also involve the use and application of well-researched preservation techniques in processing fish to
retain quality and increase shelf life, as well as adding value to produce a wide variety of products. This
also includes improved methods of known techniques such as drying fish by smoking, sun-drying and
Fisheries and aquaculture in Zimbabwe

146
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
salting. Novel technologies such as the use of solar dryers to mimic the natural drying process can be
applied, given that sunshine is in plentiful supply in Zimbabwe. Techniques and technologies can revolve
around the harvesting, storage, preservation, transporting and general handling of fish, while value addition
may include tinning, filleting, mincing and developing other products such as fish paste. In addition, the
production of several value-added products such as emulsion-based foods, Fish-protein Isolates (FPI),
Fish-protein Hydrolysate (FPH), Homogenised Fish Protein (HFP) and gelatine, can be investigated,
developed and continuously improved upon (Affognon et al., 2015).
10.3.5 Ecosystem approach
An ecosystem based approach is a holistic approach that encompasses all aspects of socio-economic
factors and biophysical environment (FAO, 2010). This approach not only focuses on fisheries but views
the sector as a combination of the various natural and manmade environments. It ensures use of practices
that are sustainable for future generations. Given this view, aquaculture practices should not have negative
impacts to other components of the environment. This practice also ensures the participation of various
stakeholders from the public and private sector which also ensures that these stakeholders contribute
towards capacity building, financial assistance, and formulation of new technologies for continued socio-
economic sustainability. In Zimbabwe, we recommend that issues such as land tenure be investigated
as in some cases farmers do not have rights over some resources such as land and water. There are
some communities which are dependent on shared scarce water resources which might increase their
vulnerabilities in the face of climate change http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1750e/i1750e00.htm.
Transformational adaptation
Case study: From crops to fish farming
Fish farming is being promoted in Mutasa District of Zimbabwe to diversify livelihood sources in the
face of a changing climate. This is a relatively new undertaking for many farmers in the area as fish is
not among the class of livestock often domesticated. Such “transformational” forms of adaptation where
farmers take on entirely new production systems in response to a changing climate are quite distinct from
more “incremental” approaches which seek to refine already existing systems. Involving new systems
and, transformational changes are often quite daunting for farmers as they represent a steep learning
curve. Sustained information, training and learning exchanges are key to this endeavour.
The “how” of fish farming
A key element of the interventions promoting fish farming in Mutasa District is the training and farmer
exchange programmes that aim to provide exposure to farmers. Although this might look like a daunting
undertaking for an outsider, those doing it emphasise that it is not as complicated as most might think.
As described by Mr Saphiri, the technology is quite simple.
Mr Saphiri—Transformational adaptation (from crops to fish)

147
Technical requirements of fish farming
“Recommended ponds are those measuring 10m x 10m that can carry 500 fish from when they are
fingerlings to maturity. The pond has a deeper end (1.5–1.8m) and shallow end (0.5 – 0.8m). The shallow
end is where he feeds them from. When it’s cold you see the fish going to the deeper end and when it’s
hot they prefer the shallow end. A pipe on the deep end is needed for cleaning purposes and drainage.
During the first week fish are to be fed with Juvenile I, then Juvenile II and III in Week 2 and 3 respectively.
It is important to check weight gain at regular intervals. After that, feed them Growers till harvesting time.
Planting trees around the pond is generally not encouraged. Trees will interfere with sunlight, fish like
warmer temperatures.

The issue of oxygen is critical—running water is the best as fresh water brings naturally dissolved
oxygen. Still water systems are also possible if one does not have running water. These just need more
regular cleaning to avoid accumulation of dirt from things like fish excreta. How do you detect low oxygen
levels? When you see fish staying on top of the water it suggests oxygen levels are low. The pond might
be dirty, so you need to clean and add fresh water. Ensure that there are not too many green plants in the
water as this may reduce oxygen levels, particularly in the evening when there is competition for oxygen
so fish may die. Algae has to be present but the quantities have to be managed to avoid competition.”
Mr Jombe, Agritex, Mutasa District
Can fish farming offer a viable CSA alternative at scale?
The idea of fish farming is getting broader acceptance. In this Ward alone two groups are
constructing ponds. Each group has 38 individuals, mostly women. The interest came after the field
day that was held by Mr Saphiri. The groups are using more water efficient systems of ponds that uses
plastic lining (dam liners) to prevent any seepage of water. Tilapia fish can easily adapt to most climates
and fish generally prefer warmer climates. This is compatible with a trend of rising temperatures that is
expected to continue with climate change in the country. As such fish farming (especially with breeds
like Tilapia) has the potential to do well in every part of country as long as one has a source of fresh
water. The low cost of infrastructure and low operating costs also mean that this option is accessible to
even poorly resourced farmers. The local market is grossly undersupplied with fish, meaning that there
is a huge opportunity for marketing of fish across the country. It’s clear that this is a viable investment
option for diversifying rural livelihoods in the face of a changing climate. Considerable investment is
however required for support training of extension staff, learning exchanges for farmers and for bigger
projects, deploying necessary financing.
Lessons Learnt from Mr Saphiri
Detailed technical understanding of fish farming displayed by the local AGRITEX official, Mr Jombe, and
the Fish Farmer himself, Mr Saphiri, is very encouraging. Even though this is a relatively new enterprise,
the training programmes seem to be very effective and the required information and experience is
now available locally. With more exposure for farmers through field days and additional investment in
extension services, the prospects for fish farming in Mutasa district seem good.
Fisheries and aquaculture in Zimbabwe

148
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
10.4  Fisheries
Inland capture fisheries have been the major source of fish in Zimbabwe where more yields were realised
when compared to yields from aquaculture. FAO statistics show that before 2014, more fish yields were
realised from capture fisheries rather than aquaculture (FAO, 2016b, http://www.fao.org/fishery/facp/ZWE/
en). Capture fisheries involve fish extraction from surface waters (Welcomme et al., 2010). This type
of fishery remains important to Zimbabwe’s fisheries sector as most of the country’s private and public
dams are home to the practice of capture and recreational fisheries. Large scale commercial capture
fisheries are present at Lake Kariba followed by Lakes Manyame and Mutirikwi as well as Chivero and
Mazvikadei Dam (FAO, 2003, http://www.fao.org/fi/oldsite/FCP/en/ZWE/body.htm). Inland capture fisheries
are often characterised by small-scale or household fishing which raises participation at various levels for
local consumption (Welcomme et al., 2010). More often, increased participation reportedly accounts for
overfishing, leading to reduced wild fish stocks and possible extinction of species in rivers and dams.
10.4.1	 Drivers of capture fisheries
Demand is the major driver which most often leads to an increase of capture fisheries.
Economic conditions drive and shape consumer choices especially when it comes to food. When
economic conditions deteriorate, people resort to cheaper sources of food and nutrients such as fish which
are a good yet cheap source of protein.
Policies and management/regulations of a country also drive demand to some extent as it creates an
enabling environment. Effective regulation of fisheries from guiding policies to enforcement stabilise capture
fisheries whilst lack of regulation and enforcement will lead to increased capture fisheries. Zimbabwe has
relatively progressive fisheries development policies whose objectives are inclusive of the following:
i.
Knowledge-based management approach;
ii.
Economic growth that is pro-poor; and
iii.	 Food security
The principal objective of the management of Lake Kariba and other water bodies is the maintenance of
optimum sustainable yields of fish populations by promulgating and enforcing conservation principles. The
development, control and management of fisheries in Zimbabwe are sufficiently covered by enabling laws.
Fishery enhancement is as a result of fish introductions to lakes for enhanced fish production. This
tends to promote increased capture fisheries as fish stocks are increased. An example of this driver is the
Command Fisheries Programme introduced by the Government of Zimbabwe in 2017 which has seen the
introduction of fish into major dams with 700,000 fingerlings distributed across 20 districts in the country
through the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate’s Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management
Authority. The Programme was launched in the newly commissioned Tokwe-Mukosi Dam where over
20,000 fingerlings were stocked with an additional 1.5 million fingerlings expected to be stocked in the
same reservoir by the end of the year (New ZIANA, 2017; http://www.bh24.co.zw/government-embarks-
on-command-fish-farming/). ZPWMA) has also recently stocked Insukamini Dam with 100,000 fingerlings
in Midlands Province, while over 110,000 fingerlings have been stocked in other dams that excludes
Insukamini. Figure 10.4 shows fish introduced into Biri Dam (Mashonaland West Province) as part of the
Programme. Unfortunately, these fish did not survive the introduction.

National Command Aquaculture Programme. Picture was taken during the annual waterfowl
count at Biri Dam (July 2017), courtesy of Chinhoyi University of Technology’s Department
of Wildlife, Ecology and Conservation
10.4.2  Current methods of capture farming (based on fishing gear) and
their impacts
Use of gill nets – gill nets are the most common gear used for fishing at commercial scale. The governing
body for capture fisheries, the Zimbabwe Parks and ZPWMA sets the specific mesh sizes of gillnets to be
used for fisheries and they also enforce the use of the standard mesh-sizes by fishing cooperatives. The
Authority is also responsible for regulating the material used in the manufacture of gill nets to minimise
the long-term effects of ghost-fishing when gillnets are torn and lost in lakes, dams or rivers. Ghost fishing
occurs when gillnets used for fishing are torn away from where they are set and are carried to other
parts of water bodies where they continue to “catch” fish or other organisms especially when they are not
biodegradable. Oftentimes, gill nets do not just catch fish, they can potentially catch anything that happens
to try and swim through them.
Seine-netting – This form of fishing is also used in the country besides gill-netting. An impact of this fishing
method is that it results in large amounts of by-catch. In Lake Kariba where the bulk of fishing is mainly
based on Kapenta (Limnothrissa miodon), use of seine nets results in by-catches of tigerfish (Hydrocynus
vittatus).
Electro-fishing – This type of fishing is mostly done as part of research when different sized fish from juveniles
to adults are sought. Special research permits from ZPWMA are required before this can be practiced.
Rods – Small scale fishing by local people usually involves the use of fishing rods which make use of
bait to capture fish. The number of hooks per fishing rod is restricted by the ZPWMA and a bag system
which restricts the number of fish to be caught per day is used. Overall, this method minimises the risk
of overfishing.
Other informal fishing methods – As capture fisheries are characterised by numerous small-scale fishers
for household consumption, some methods of fishing are often improvised at local level without adhering
to standard methods of fishing. Fishermen prefer to use traditional and illegal methods, which also kill
fingerlings. This can include drown nets, mosquito nets or old tin cans with food inside as fish bait which is
often detrimental to the growth of the fishing industry.
Fisheries and aquaculture in Zimbabwe

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
10.4.3  Conservation and sustainability of fisheries
The drivers of capture fisheries described in this chapter can lead to increased and unregulated fishing by
both commercial and small-scale fishers. This can threaten the sustainability of natural fish stock in dams
and more so, under a changing climate. Thus, conservation measures, including direct controls on catches
and/or fishing, are designed to reduce death rates due to fishing and pollution, especially on small juvenile
fish. These control measures include restricting fishing gear size, closing up areas which are restricted
from fishing such as river mouths, and permitting only licensed users to fish (FAO, 2016b). Similarly, there
will always be an incentive to reduce mesh size further or to fish in previously closed areas to catch more
abundant stocks of fish that are being protected by conservation measures.
Demand for fish and advances in  technology  have led to fishing practices that are depleting fishery
resources. Sustainable fishing guarantees that there will be populations of freshwater wildlife for the future
(Box 10.1).  It is important to follow practices such as those in the Philippines, where the Tagbanua people
have traditionally employed fishing practices that simultaneously harvest and maintain fish populations
(National Geographic Society, 2017, https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/sustainable-
fishing/). They fish for specific species only during certain times of the year and set aside certain areas,
such as protected spots, in which fishing is prohibited. They use hook-and-line methods, catching only
what they need to feed themselves and their communities. Conservation approaches are important in the
wake of climate change and variability which have been shown to bear a compounded negative effect
on fish production among other factors and have been attributed to the declining fish stocks in the major
fishery of Kariba (Ndebele-Murisa et al., 2011; Marshall, 2012).
BOX 10.1  Fishing nets in Africa
The Shangani people of South-eastern Zimbabwe use reed nets and fish traps (maduwo) that have
holes big enough to allow juvenile fish to pass through but small enough to trap the adult fish. This
ensures sustainability by allowing the younger fish to survive and provide a brood stock for the next
season. Present-day fish poachers use similar traps but these will be covered with mosquito nets which
trap every size of fish and preserve nothing for the future. Even most gillnets used by commercial and
artisanal fishermen today grossly infringe the mesh sizes prescribed by the Parks and Wildlife Act.
The Shangani Chiefs would prohibit fishing in nursery zones and during spawning periods, a method
also adopted in modern fishing regulations, but today we see a lot of protected areas being fished
out. Hopefully, the National Fisheries Policy being developed for Zimbabwe will address these issues
by reviewing traditional fishing methods and learning from them. Because of the need to feed more
people today and export our products, aquaculture should be encouraged so that we can balance the
conservation of wild fish populations versus demand with increased fish production.

151
10.5  Climate-smart agriculture: system approaches
System approaches denote that whole systems that lead to best practices for climate-smart agriculture
must be considered rather than looking at single elements or practices in CSA. System approaches in CSA
would therefore entail detailed analysis of ecosystems, value chains and landscapes (AG Team, 2016,
https://agrilinks.org/blog/watch-systems-approach-climate-smart-agriculture).
10.5.1  Ecosystems
10.5.1.1  Climate change
Evidence shows that many of the effects of a changing climate are already occurring, including an increase
in the surface water temperature of lakes and rivers (IPCC, 2014; NASA, 2017, https://climate.nasa.gov/
effects/). It is likely that these trends will continue and that there will be changes in the flow regime of
streams and rivers associated with projected changes in the amount, seasonality, intensity and distribution
of precipitation. This will cause an increase in the transport of sediments and nutrients downstream to
lakes, as well as changes in precipitation, evaporation and flooding dynamics that will cause changes
in water levels, habitat structure and water residence times in wetlands. Climate change will also result
in shifts in ecological conditions by supporting the spread of pathogens, parasites and diseases, with
potentially serious effects on human health, agriculture and fisheries.
10.5.1.2  Invasive species and diseases
Climate change-induced alterations of ecosystem conditions can enable the spread of invasive species
(Thomas et al, 2008) through both range expansion and the creation of habitats and conditions that are
suitable for newly introduced invasive species. Invasive species are generally viewed as having a broader
range of tolerances (i.e., a bigger bioclimatic envelope) than natives, thereby providing invaders with a
Fisheries and aquaculture in Zimbabwe

152
Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
wider array of suitable habitats (Walther et al., 2009). A shift in temperature, for example, might then
have significant impacts on a native species, but little impact on introduced species, thereby altering
the competitive dynamics between them. The broad categories of climate change impacts on species
composition and ecosystems are gradually becoming better defined, though the full implications of these
types of changes, particularly at the site level are still unknown and could be unique in each case.
10.5.1.3  Socioeconomic issues: livelihoods and resilience
Climate change has already had significant impacts on the livelihoods of communities and households,
especially in the drought-prone regions of Zimbabwe. In these areas, adequate water resources are
available (e.g., Binga with access to Lake Kariba), thus a shift towards greater dependence on aquaculture
and fishery resources is inevitable. The introduction of CSA methods is therefore vital for the sustainability
of such practices and for ensuring food security for these communities. It is also important to guard against
the imposition of certain technologies that may not be acceptable to these communities.
10.6  Value chains
10.6.1  Transportation of products from source to markets
Zimbabwe has a fairly good road network, but for fish products there is still need for specialised transport
vessels. The cost of fuels and the poor road conditions and networks compromises the market price of the
product, although fish remain relatively cheap compared to other livestock products.
10.6.2  Live translocation of aquatic animals
During the period that is required to bring the fry up to market size, the fish will be physically transferred
several times (from pond to pond, pond to cage etc.), it is therefore important to foresee the acquisition of
all the equipment necessary for these movements.
10.6.3  Post-harvest technologies
The supply chain includes all links from the point of production (point of catch or farm site in the case of
aquaculture) to the end-user or final consumer. The supply chain for fish and fishery products can involve
a large number of people between the fisher or fish-farmer and the final consumer. The supply side of fish
and fishery products is affected by factors such as market demand, prices, seasonality, climatic conditions,
population dynamics, economic situation, fuel prices, and the policy and legal environment. The perishable
nature of fish requires special attention to handling, grading and packing, and the market price is usually
dependent upon its quality, although this is not always the case when demand does not match supply.
The application of modern fishery technology starts from culture and ends in exporting the product. As
noted earlier, post-harvest fishery technology involves processing, preservation, handling, harvesting
and marketing. In developing countries, such as Zimbabwe where tropical weather and under-developed
infrastructure contribute to the problem, losses sometimes reach staggering proportions. Losses occur in
all operations, from harvesting to handling, storage, processing and marketing. Many developing-country
producers are marginalised from global supply chains due to their poor maintenance of quality standards.
In general, low-tech developing country suppliers earn less for their resources, whereas industrial nations
earn extra premiums by means of marketing information systems, supply chain management, quality
assurance regimes, transport, handling, post-harvest and production technologies. A number of the donor-
driven aquaculture initiatives as mentioned earlier in this chapter endeavour to teach fish farmers some
post-harvest techniques but this knowledge and practice has not been fully utilised to prolong the shelf life of
fish post-harvest. However, notable examples of best practices when it comes to meeting high standards for
harvesting fish such as Lake Harvest and Kariba Bream can be emulated and encouraged across the nation.

153
10.6.4  Public health issues
As with any agricultural commodity, both actual and potential public health hazards exist. Some of these can
be prevented, but others are still unknown because of the lack of science-based assessment of human risk
and inadequate diagnostic and detection procedures. The proper cleaning, processing, storage, handling
and marketing of these highly perishable products, the restriction of consumption to properly cooked products
and attention to sanitary operating procedures will minimise potential safety hazards. Health problems may
arise when abuse of regulations and carelessness occur. Other public-health risks in some locations are
linked to the transmission of diseases by insect or snail vectors, such as schistosomiasis and malaria.
10.7  Enabling environment for CSA
Enabling CSA environments are the framework conditions that facilitate and support the adoption of
climate-smart technologies and practices. They include policies, institutional arrangements, stakeholder
involvement, gender considerations, infrastructure and insurance schemes, as well as access to weather
information and advisory services. They help build institutional capacity at all levels and reduce the risks
that deter farmers from investing in new technologies and practices (https://www.csa.guide/csa/enabling-
environments).
Policies should be put in place that strengthen institutions in support of CSA for fisheries and aquaculture
development in Zimbabwe. All stakeholders from private and public sectors will need to be involved in the
development of context-specific options to ensure the fisheries and aquaculture sector is climate-smart.
There should also be capacity building at grassroots level as some CSA practices require expertise in
order for them to be successful. There is need as a country to think around how we can acquire the
necessary competencies and integrate the various stakeholders so as to provide resilience through an
interdisciplinary approach.
10.7.1  Policy review and analysis
The creation and implementation of appropriate policies and an enabling environment are essential for
achieving the widespread adoption of CSA in Zimbabwe. In general, the objective in CSA policy engagement
is to guide policies and remove components that act as disincentives for adopting CSA such as public
subsidies, while reallocating resources to programmes that provide incentives for the adoption of CSA.
Policy tools and instruments, such as rural credit programmes, input- and output-pricing policies, subsidies,
support for investments with public-good benefits, property rights, research and extension services and
safety net programmes can all be used to increase the incentives for the actors involved, including farmers,
to modify production systems and build capacities for CSA (FAO, 2013). Zimbabwe’s bilateral/international
obligations include the Protocol on Economic and Technical Cooperation concerning the Management
and Development of Fisheries on Lake Kariba and the Transboundary Waters of the Zambezi River, the
SADC Protocol on Fisheries, the Convention on Biological Diversity, CITES and the Ramsar Convention.
Zimbabwe is also a member of the Aquaculture Network for Africa (ANAF), all of which are more technically
binding and aimed at conservation rather than sustainable use.
10.7.2  Legislation
The Parks and Wildlife Act (Chapter 20:14) lays down the regulations for aquaculture management in
Zimbabwe, while the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority grants authority for the
development of aquaculture on state dams and in waters designated as recreational parks. However,
recent developments within the Ministries of Water, Environment and Climate, and that of Agriculture,
Mechanisation and Irrigation Development are overseeing the development of a fisheries and aquaculture
policy framework that will revolutionise the implementation of aquaculture programmes in the country and
its development is set to be finalised soon.

10.7.3  Role of Public-Private Partnerships
Public-private Partnerships (PPP) will strengthen the implementation of sustainable aquaculture and
fisheries programmes. For example, the recent formation of the Zimbabwe Fish Producers Association
in 2016, which is all inclusive and focuses on increasing aquaculture production in the country is a case
in point.
10.7.4  Research and development, training and extension
Research institutions and academia continue to play a leading role in CSA initiatives in the aquaculture
sector and a key area in this regard is the improvement of fingerling and feed production and supply as
mentioned earlier, as well as extension services. In terms of training, the development of robust capacity
building and curricula in fisheries and aquaculture that meet the industry’s needs as well as tailored
internships and mentorship at fish farms and aquaculture-related industries as reflected by the resolutions
made by the SADC-WorldFish-FAO Aquaculture Expert Working Group (2016) are essential for Zimbabwe.
A few positive steps have been made in that direction with the University of Zimbabwe’s, University Lake
Kariba Research Station (ULKRS), for instance, having been awarded EU funding via World Vision for
the construction of an experimental aquaculture facility that will spearhead research in the country. The
Department of Freshwater and Fishery Science at Chinhoyi University is working with WorldFish and Lake
Harvest towards the development of aquaculture research and training services such as short courses
and attachment for practical experience. The Zimbabwean Government, through the Research Council of
Zimbabwe, should prioritise the funding of CSA research in line with the national economic blueprint—the
Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (ZimAsset).
10.7.5  Gender issues
Gender mainstreaming in the fisheries and aquaculture industries is of paramount value in CSA, as most
vulnerable populations include women and children. The empowerment of women in fish production
sectors has already set a pace in aquaculture production and poverty alleviation. Most case studies and
running projects in fish farming in Zimbabwe have women in leading roles. Drawing more attention and
education of women in this sector will be one of the key drivers of success in the implementation of CSA.
10.8  Conclusions
This chapter has described the history, development, status and potential of the fisheries and aquaculture
sectors of Zimbabwe. Scenarios of the development and implementation of climate-smart approaches in
these sectors were discussed. Zimbabwe is set for increased production and development in fisheries
and aquaculture despite a changing climate. CSA approaches and practices present opportunities to grow
the fisheries and aquaculture industry in order to meet growing demand and to enable water and soil
conservation within a sustainable framework.

11.	 Energy management in

agriculture
Abstract
Energy is essential for agriculture in Zimbabwe. On the other hand, energy generated from fossil fuels results
in emissions of greenhouse gases which are linked to climate change. Therefore this chapter endeavours
to advocate renewable forms of energy which have a benign effect on climate change. These renewable
sources of energy are the sun (solar energy), wind, water and geothermal energy. The intensive use of
energy in modern agriculture calls for judicious management of traditional forms of energy, coupled with
the accelerated diffusion of technologies that are related to renewable forms of energy. This is imperative
for sustainable food production. The chapter assesses the extent to which renewable energies and energy
management opportunities can support the triple-win strategy being promoted through the CSA concept.
The combination of renewable energy and improvements in efficiency contribute to all three pillars of CSA,
i.e., improving productivity, climate resilience and reducing emissions from fossil fuel utilisation. Zimbabwe
has a high potential for the exploitation of renewable energy. A number of solar PV projects have been
implemented demonstrating the suitability, sustainability and economic convenience of off-grid solar power
installations. Other projects that have shown good results are biomass use from wood waste, bagasse, and
biogas generation from bio-digesters. Although the average wind speed in Zimbabwe (3m/s) is relatively
low, developments in wind technology make power generation and water pumping feasible. Finally, the
chapter shows that there is need for the capacity-building and strengthening of tertiary institutions that
teach and conduct research on energy efficiency and renewables.
Key Words: adaptation, energy conservation, energy efficiency, energy management, GHG emissions
mitigation, renewable energy

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
11.1  Introduction
11.1.1  Definitions of energy management and renewable energy
Energy management (EM), in the context of this chapter, refers to managing all forms of energy used at
the farm and beyond the farm gate, as well as optimising operations and processes of value chain addition
to reduce energy usage and costs by implementing an Energy Management System (EMS). This requires
the judicious and effective use of energy to maximise profits (minimise costs) and enhance competitive
positions. EM requires use of action plans that focus on two major components: Energy Conservation (EC)
and Energy Efficiency (EE). Simply put, EM uses less energy for the same output without compromising
on quality.
Energy conservation involves activities which reduce the wasteful use of energy usage through
appropriate behavioural aspects (i.e., if you do not need, switch it off). The term energy efficiency is widely
used, but not always well understood. According to UNIDO (2011), EE may be defined as the ratio of useful
outputs to energy inputs for a system where the latter may be an individual energy conversion device (e.g.,
a boiler), a building, an industrial process, a firm, a sector or an entire economy.10
Renewable Energy (RE) is any energy source that is naturally replenished, that is, from a source that is
not depleted when used, such as solar, wind, geothermal, biomass or hydroelectric generation.
11.1.2  Energy, climate change and agriculture
Worldwide agricultural energy activities are largely fossil-dependent. To enhance food security while at the
same time reducing reliance on fossil fuels in agro-processing activities, there is need to engage in sound
management of energy systems (to decouple energy use from increased agricultural productivity), as well
as to shift to the use of renewables to mitigate climate change. Climate change threatens the stability and
productivity of agricultural systems in Zimbabwe. Agriculture is itself the second major GHG-emitting sector
after the energy sector. Therefore, there is a need to address issues of sustainable food production, climate
resilience and mitigation.
11.1.3  Energy and gender in agriculture
In Zimbabwe, women and girls are often primarily responsible for gathering biomass for the household’s
energy needs, a reflection of traditional socio-cultural roles. Rural electricity access is only about 21%,
reflecting the challenge of energy scarcity and thus increasing biomass usage. According to the SADC
Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Status Report (REN 21, 2015), Household Air Pollution (HAP)
arising from the use of biomass for cooking is affecting about 9.6 million people in Zimbabwe, and
approximately 9,200 deaths a year are attributed to it. Sociological and behavioural changes, as well as
economic and financial incentives to broaden technical options should be explored to lessen the domestic
energy burden on these women and girls. These include, improved cooking stoves and fuel efficiency, a
switch to local renewable energy resources for electricity generation, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) use
and raising awareness.
11.2  Energy management and renewable energy in Zimbabwe
Sustainable agriculture uses farming techniques that ensure good environmental health, economic
profitability, and social and economic equality without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs (Brundtland Commission, 1987). However, as a result of the industrialisation and
consolidation of agriculture, food production has become increasingly dependent on energy derived from
10

161
fossil fuels (FAO, 2014), a condition that is largely unsustainable. There is a need for the reduced use of
non-renewable energy sources and their replacement with renewable sources and/or physical labour to
the extent that this is economically feasible.
11.2.1  Energy sources: supply and demand in Zimbabwe
The main sources of energy in Zimbabwe are coal, wood fuel, electricity and petroleum fuels. According to
the 2009 national energy balance, wood fuel provides the bulk (61%) of the total energy supply, followed by
liquid fuels (18%), electricity (13%) and coal (8%) (NEP, 2012). Regarding electricity, coal is still the main
pillar of installed capacity (58%), followed by large hydroelectric (37%), whereas clean energy sources
(small hydroelectric plants, biomass and waste) cover only 5% of national needs (MoEPD, 2016a). The
majority (67%) of the Zimbabwean population live in rural areas and derive their livelihoods directly from
agriculture-related activities.
The national electrification percentage is about 40%, there being little penetration of other forms of energy such
as LPG, and charcoal, or renewables such as solar, biogas, wind power and small hydro-power. Zimbabwe’s
national electricity peak demand at current suppressed industrial capacity utilisation is 1,400 MW against
an average supply of 1,000 MW, leaving a supply deficit of 400 MW (MoEPD, 2016b), which is met through
imports of energy from neighbouring countries. The deficit can be reduced by increased use of energy-efficient
measures and renewable energy interventions in all sectors of the economy, including agriculture.
11.2.2  Energy consumption in agriculture
According to the 2014 International Energy Agency report, Zimbabwe’s energy balance for the agricultural
sector was 584 kilo tonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe) which is equivalent to 6,791.92 GWh. The proportion of
energy sources used in agriculture are shown in Figure 11.1 (a). The agriculture sector in Zimbabwe directly
used 6% of the total electricity consumed (9,341 GWh) in 2013 (ZERA, 2014), as shown in Figure 11.1(b).
Figure 11.1  Energy consumption
Source: IEA, 2014

Source: ZERA, 2014
The sector has the potential to save 12% (58.75 GWh/year) in electricity consumption through a number
of energy-efficient measures (ZERA, 2015). In Zimbabwe, electricity and fossil fuels are used by small-
to large-scale commercial farming systems, whereas in most rural areas, animal-drawn and human
labour are the most exploitable sources of power for subsistence farming and small family farming units.
Table 11.1 shows the main energy sources used in the agricultural production cycle.

11.2.3  Emissions from agriculture
Globally, agriculture is a significant sector in terms of GHG emissions. The sector contributes 5.0 to 5.8
GtCO2eq/year, corresponding to 10–12% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions (Smith et al., 2014). If pre-
and post-process emissions are included, global food systems contribute between 19% and 29% of global
GHG emissions (Vermeulen et al., 2012). The majority of agriculture-related emissions are generated in
developing countries, with an average contribution of 35% to global emissions (Smith et al., 2014). Figure 11.2
shows the relative contributions of agriculture processes, activities or sectors to global agriculture emissions.
Figure 11.2  Breakdown of agricultural emissions
Source: MICCA, 2015

163
Most of the sub-sectors mentioned in Figure 11.2 are energy-related, either because they are heavily
energy-demanding in their production processes (synthetic fertilisers, for instance), or just because they
might constitute an on-farm costless source of energy (manure).
As mentioned earlier, agriculture is the second major national source of GHG emissions, contributing
about 44% of total emissions (22,019.566 Gg CO2eq) in Zimbabwe. This percentage (44%) is higher than
the average mentioned for developing countries. Thus, it is clear that there is urgent need to decouple
increased agricultural productivity from increased emissions.
There are tools which can be used to estimate GHG emissions and carbon sequestration, such as the EX-
ACT (EX-Ante Carbon-balance Tool),11 which provides ex-ante estimates of the impact of agriculture and
forestry development projects, programmes and policies on GHG emissions and carbon sequestration.
11.2.4  Energy management standards
Zimbabwe has developed energy standards (ZWISO 50002-4:2014, ZWISO 50015:2014) modelled on
the international energy standards ISO 50000 series, which can help the country to manage, track and
improve its energy use. The standards help in implementing an energy management system based on the
Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. Good energy management plugs unnecessary energy leaks, improves the cost
competitiveness of the product and hence boosts incomes.
11.3  Opportunities for energy management and renewable energy
The key steps in implementing EM opportunities involve establishing the baseline energy use (energy
auditing) and identification of all Significant Energy Users (SEUs). Once key energy users are identified,
steps are taken to identify the key drivers for the energy use. Energy-saving opportunities are then identified
and energy targets set before they are implemented. The energy consumption with EM measures in place
is then measured, monitored and tracked to evaluate the implemented measure’s energy savings. The ISO
50001 management model can be used for continual improvements of energy use. EM opportunities are
implemented as mitigation measures to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions.
The profitability and sustainability of all the components of the agro-value chains may be improved
by addressing their energy intensity through energy-efficient measures. Table 11.2 summarises the
opportunities for cost savings offered by the introduction of energy-efficient measures in each element of
the value chain, expressing them as impacts or benefits.
Only a few measures may end up showing a trade-off with other issues, such as the case of conservation
agriculture (low mechanisation and soil disturbance versus high labour demand) or drying field crops
(no energy costs versus potential increase of post-harvest losses). Drivers of energy usage need to be
identified and addressed.
11.3.1  Barriers and strategies for implementation of EM and RE
The following are some of the general barriers to implementing EM and RE in the agricultural sector:
••
Lack of enabling policy and regulatory framework for EM and RE;
••
Lack of awareness of the benefits of EE;
••
Limited or lack of technical expertise in energy systems, e.g., energy auditing;
••
Focus is on yield (output) instead of on energy efficiency and energy conservation;
••
Component approach instead of systems approach in energy systems;

Government should enact enabling policies and policy instruments that promote EE and EC through
relevant institutions;
••
Training of experts on EM, RE and energy auditing, including measurement, monitoring and
verification;
••
Documenting and sharing the achievement of annual energy goals and targets;

11.3.2  Adaptation measures to reduce losses and risks in the energy system
Due to the current food insecurity in the country, Zimbabwe prioritises adaptation initiatives to climate
change as set out in her INDCs submitted to the UNFCCC in 2015. Table 11.3 summarises the adaptation
measures which can be pursued under CSA in Zimbabwe:

11.3.3  Mitigation measures to reduce GHG emissions
Zimbabwe is pursuing mitigation measures to reduce GHG emissions in agriculture when these exist as
the core benefits of an adaptation measure. For example, the push to mechanised farming and improved
irrigation water efficiency is not borne out of the need to reduce emissions from fuel use or electricity, but
to improve yields in the face of dwindling water supplies (adaptation).
There are three main GHG mitigation options in agriculture:
••
Increasing carbon dioxide storage in soils and biomass;
••
Reducing emissions during agricultural production; and
••
Indirectly, reducing the required volume of agricultural production.
These mitigation options are due to a number of measures, some of which are shown in Table 11.4.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
11.3.4  Renewable energy resources with potential in agriculture
Zimbabwe is endowed with relevant potentialities for the exploitation of renewable energy. For agricultural
purposes, solar, wind, biomass and hydropower are discussed in this section due to their wide applicability
in the sector.
11.3.4.1  Solar photovoltaic, solar thermal and wind resources
An assessment by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) on Solar Photovoltaics (PV),
Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and wind energy zones covering countries in the power pools of eastern
and southern Africa, identified the following potential for renewable energy sources in Zimbabwe:
••
Solar PV: 109 GW (at 230 W/m2),
••
CSP: 39.5 GW (at 270 W/m2)
••
Wind power: of 39.3 GW (at 200 W/m2)
With an average solar energy of 16–20MJ/m2 (4.4–5.5 MW/m2) and 3,000 sun-hours annually (NEP, 2012),
solar PV, solar thermal, and CSP are feasible and attractive in most parts of the country. Solar intensity
and sunshine hours are the two variables that are essential for evaluating the feasibility and profitability
of solar system installations. The assessment is based on specific site, farm or production system energy
demands. PV and CSP are also suitable for on-farm power generation, while solar thermal can address
hot water needs in households and on farms. It is possible to use online web-tools and calculators capable
of attributing these variables to a specific place by providing the geographical coordinates such as the
Renewable Energy Target (RET) Screen or the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS).
Wind power, with an average wind speed of about 3m/s, (NEP, 2012) constitutes a concrete energy potential,
but that potential is highly site-specific. However, average wind speed is suitable for water-pumping for
various farm requirements, while at higher altitudes and with advanced technology, the resource can be
used for power generation.
11.3.4.2  Biomass
Zimbabwe has ample biomass resources with a potential of 1,000 MW (Draft Renewable Energy Policy,
2016), ranging from bagasse from sugar-milling to sawdust from timber-processing and forestry waste, as
well as agricultural and livestock waste. Agricultural and livestock waste can be used for biogas production
for domestic and farm needs, while sawdust can be used to make briquettes for domestic use or for
electricity generation. Examples include the 78 MW Tongaat Hulett bagasse-fed plants, the 18 MW Green
Fuel (bagasse) plant and the 0.5 MW Border Timbers (timber waste) plant. Household and institutional
bio-digesters are being installed by the Rural Electrification Agency and some NGOs. The objective is to
broaden the energy mix and lessen the demand for electricity and fossil fuels used for heating and cooking
purposes. Figure 11.3 shows the biomass potential in Zimbabwe.
11.3.4.3  Hydropower
Zimbabwe’s large hydropower projects produce more than 3,840 MW, mainly concentrated along the
Zambezi River, including the 2,400 MW Batoka Gorge plant. Most of Zimbabwe’s small and mini-hydro
potential is located in the Eastern Highlands, which are mainly run-off river schemes. Currently, the installed
mini-hydro capacity is 25 MW (ZERA, 2015). There is potential to generate 120 MW from small and mini-
hydro resources (NIB, 2008). The draft renewable-energy policy has provisions for the construction of
small-hydro plants at all major irrigation dams, thus using water to produce electricity before it is used for
irrigation. Figure 11.3 shows the potential for biomass and hydropower generation in Zimbabwe.

11.4  Importance of energy management in CSA
11.4.1  Role of tertiary and research institutions
In meeting the mitigation pillar for CSA, Zimbabwe should pursue a low-emissions development pathway.
Tertiary and research institutions should have support for the research, development, deployment and
diffusion of new green technologies in the agricultural sector. These institutions should also:
••
Conduct capacity-building for extension workers: pre-train and in-service training of extension
workers (on EE and RE in agriculture) under the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation;
••
Conduct adaptive capacity and vulnerability assessments; and
••
Design curricula on energy management for CSA from the primary education level to the tertiary level.
11.4.2  Relevance to agricultural extension officers
Energy is the key to attaining food security. Extension workers who are in direct contact with farmers should
be knowledgeable about energy trends, costs, efficient technologies and new technologies and should
also be able to disseminate their knowledge effectively by directing appropriate information communication
technologies on energy and energy management information to various stakeholders in the agro-value chain.
11.4.3  Financing sustainable energy use in agriculture
The financing of CSA activities from public resources in Zimbabwe is rather inadequate. The increasing
risk and uncertainty that farmers face due to climate change impacts is having serious implications for
agricultural investment. Therefore, a blend of different financing mechanisms should be adopted in order
to have a significant impact on energy management in CSA in Zimbabwe.
The financing mechanisms may include the following:
••
Public finance;
••
Innovative business models like Energy Service Companies (ESCOs);
••
Local or regional development banks such as the AfDB;
••
Financial instruments, such as feed-in-tariffs;
••
Public-private sector partnerships; and
••
Private sector

11.5  Case studies
Transition to CSA and the achievement of sustainable food production, climate adaptation and mitigation
and energy security can only happen if existing examples of energy-smart food systems can be scaled
up significantly (FAO, 2013). This section gives examples of sustainable-energy projects that have been
implemented successfully in Zimbabwe.
11.5.1  Electricity and heat production at Charter Saw Mill in Chimanimani
This combined heat and power plant (Figure 11.4) produces 0.5 MW of electricity and 5 MW of process
heat. The project was successfully connected to the national grid in June 2011. The waste wood and
sawdust that is produced within the sawmill itself (both renewable resources) forms the heat source for the
boilers, which produce steam that is then turned into electricity. Use of saw mill waste has helped to solve
the problem of waste disposal.

11.5.2  Chipendeke mini-hydro (Practical Action Zimbabwe)
The 25 kW micro-hydro scheme at Chipendeke (Figure 11.4), Mutare South, was commissioned in 2008.
The run-off river scheme has a mini-grid for 27 households, six shops, a school and a clinic.
11.5.3  Biodigesters: Victory Farm
Waste from pig pens is channelled into the biogas digester (Figure 11.5), which produces power for the
farm. Excess methane gas is pressurised and stored in gas tanks. This gas is used to power the generator.
The farmer has also developed a small mobile digester made from a 200-litre oil drum. The waste produced
from his kitchen is fed into this digester on a daily basis, and it provides enough energy for cooking.

11.5.4  Drying
The Kutsaga barn is designed to promote high-combustion efficiency, minimising the release of greenhouse
gas emissions. As a result, it uses up to 62% less fuelwood than rocket or conventional barns. While the
conventional barn uses 9 kg of wood to cure a kilogramme of tobacco, and the rocket barn between 4 and
4.5 kg, the Kutsaga barn shown in Figure 11.5 uses just 3 to 3.5 kg.
11.5.5  Solar-powered irrigation scheme at a Selous farm, Norton
A 0.96 kWp solar-powered drip-irrigation demonstration unit (Figure 11.6) was set up at a Selous farm,
Chegutu District, with a 0.75 hp solar pump unit. The system produces 10,000 litres of water per day, which
is fed via a 2,000-litre storage tank. Water flows by gravity to irrigate one acre of vegetables (Figure 11.6).

11.5.6  Village Case studies
11.5.6.1  Case study on solar powered drip irrigation: Zinkondweni irrigation scheme,
Umzingwane District
The use of solar powered pumping systems is a recent innovation that promises to be a game changer
for low-cost, sustainable irrigation design.
Can solar powered drip irrigation play a significant role in upscaling?
The case of Zinkondweni irrigation scheme shows that the era of solar powered irrigation has arrived.
Such off grid systems mean that irrigation is no longer restricted to areas with electricity or to those
that can afford the high operating costs of diesel powered pumping systems. Solar powered irrigation
systems can be installed anywhere, utilising both surface and underground water sources. Groundwater
sources are generally underutilised in Zimbabwe yet trends in climate such as the rising temperatures
suggest that these are more secure water sources than surface storage that is prone to high evaporative
losses. Developing and managing ground water sources is perhaps one of the most important adaptation
investments that justify deployment of public, private and development financing. Although the initial
cost may seem high, the infrastructure is designed to last for many years and with high-value crops
and all year round production, payback periods are very short. Such investments are potential areas of
partnerships with the private sector and financial institutions to leverage financing.
Drip irrigation technology is low-cost, versatile, and highly water-efficient, ensuring that every drop goes
to improving productivity. As reduced availability of water is one of the main impacts of climate change in
many parts of the country, improving water use efficiency is a top priority.

11.5.6.2  Example of integration of clean energy (biogas) into CSA systems,
Goromonzi District
The Ngwerume family in Mawanga, Ward 24, Goromonzi District have discovered the benefits of a
“green living” approach to every aspect of the household. They now fully appreciate that most aspects
of their farming system and the household are connected and often complement each other in ways
that drive much better outcomes than when they are treated as stand-alone entities. Their objective is
to have an integrated climate-smart farming system that maximises such complementarities. Although
the Ngwerumes are farmers they believe a green living approach needs to touch every aspect of their
life beyond crops and livestock. In many ways they view their personal lives as intricately connected
to the farming elements of the household. As such their climate-smart investments are not only aimed
at sustainably increasing productivity and resilience of crop/livestock systems, but should also drive
improvement in overall quality of life for the household.
Key elements of the Ngwerume ”green” household include production of biogas from livestock manure
for cooking, the use of conservation agriculture (including use of compost from the biogas) for crops,
production of legume fodder for livestock. A unit for solar drying is also used for preservation of crops,
vegetables and fruits. Around the homestead the family also manages a variety of exotic and indigenous
trees for multiple purposes.

173
11.5.6.3  Biogas fuel for cooking
The concept was introduced by SNV to many farmers in Goromonzi district but only a few have been
able to use it as they do not have the required minimum number of cattle and co-financing that was
needed to build the bio-digesters. One needs at least six animals to have a functional biogas plant and
most farmers do not have such numbers.
Technical details (in farmer’s language)
“I opted for the nine cubic metre system. For the construction, I needed 35 bags of cement and other
additional inputs such as impermo12 that was used to make the digester water tight. After construction
was complete we had a problem because we needed two tonnes of fresh manure for initial feeding into
the digester. I had to go to an abattoir in Goromonzi to get fresh manure. We then mixed cow dung and
water in the same proportion and fed it through the inlet. It takes about one week for fermentation to
occur. After about two weeks the system is producing a lot of gas, enough to cook all day. You need to
feed the digester daily. I use four buckets of cow dung per day, mixed with 20 litres of water. The mixture
needs stirring to get a consistent liquid that is then poured into the digester through the inlet. The digester
is like a big pot—it’s in the centre. This is where you have the gas collection pipe that goes to the kitchen.
You have valves that can be can be opened and closed to regulate flow of gas. As you add fresh dung
every day, an equal volume of slurry is pushed out of the digester through the outlet point into the pits.
The sludge is fully digested so it does not have any odours or grass seed. We mix the sludge with other
green plant matter in alternating layers for about a month to make very high quality compost. We have
researchers that have analysed the nutrient content of the compost and they found it to be of very high
quality. Now I am now adding poultry manure to my compost mix and I believe it is even getting better.
That’s what we use for our crops and the results are better than inorganic fertilisers. I even sell excess
compost to other farmers.”
“The biogas is very safe unlike other forms of gas. We get enough gas to cook as much as we want all
day. We are even cooking beans! The heat is safe for pots. We have been using this for 3 years with no
problems. We don’t even know about collecting firewood.”
Mr Ngwerume, Farmer, Goromonzi District
11.5.6.4  Solar water heating
Rural households that have access to electricity are a small minority in Zimbabwe. Unfortunately, even
for those that are lucky to be connected to the grid, the high cost of electricity often means that they
can only use electrical power for basic functions such as lighting. The Ngwerumes were motivated by
these realities to invest in a solar water heating system to reduce their cost of electricity. Not only is
this contributing to their intentions to be a green household and better quality of life, it has significantly
reduced their electricity costs.
“We installed a solar water heating system to reduce electricity cost. This geyser gives us hot water all
the time. Since we started cooking with biogas and using the solar geyser, our electricity bill has come
down from USD 50 to only USD 20 despite my large family.”
Mr Ngwerume, Farmer, Goromonzi District

11.5.6.5  Solar drying to preserve output
Like most farmers the Ngwerumes grapple with the challenge of minimising post-harvest losses and
spreading supply of key products beyond peak season. A solar dryer for preserving a variety of products
such as vegetables, fruits and even meat is now enabling the household to minimise losses due to
oversupply during peak harvest seasons and take advantage of higher prices during the off-season
periods.
Extending the season with solar drying
“We use solar dryer for all things that require drying, such as meat, cassava, sweet potatoes, all types
of vegetables and even tomatoes and fruits like bananas. This minimises losses due to oversupply
during the peak season when the markets are flooded. We can store for long periods after drying. It’s
helpful because you have supplies even during the off-season. Even indigenous vegetables that are very
nutritious can be made available throughout the year. Fresh is good but the dried stuff is more valuable
when you sell it offseason when supplies are at their lowest. If it’s very hot two days is enough to dry
most things.”
Mrs Ngwerume, Farmer, Goromonzi District
11.6  Recommendations
Zimbabwe’s greatest barriers in achieving energy efficiency and energy management are information
dissemination, a lack of legal or statutory instruments to enforce energy management and to some extent,
the technical capacity to carry out energy audits to account for energy use, identify energy leakages and
decide how to plug them. For large-scale agro-commercial enterprises, it is recommended that energy
champions for energy efficiency and energy management activities be appointed. Smallholders should
be trained to measure, monitor and track their energy use. The capacity-building of extension workers in
areas of energy management is vital. Energy information on efficiency measures, as well as alternative
sources of energy, should be readily available to both large- and small-scale farmers. The information
gap on financing mechanisms, the causes of global warming and climate change impacts, as well as how
resilience and mitigation can be achieved should be addressed. This will encourage energy management
in the agro-value chain process. Policy and policy instruments addressing energy efficiency and energy
management should be strengthened.
11.7  Conclusion
The dependence of agriculture and the agro-value chain process on fossil fuels increases Zimbabwe’s
energy insecurity and presents a threat to its food security while increasing its GHG emissions. To increase
food productivity at competitive prices, the country should adopt CSA embracing energy management.
The benefits of energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies are environmental, economic and
social. These include reduced energy intensities and reduced GHG emissions and therefore the cost
competitiveness of products. Use of alternative energy increases adaptive capacity, while energy efficiency
is a mitigation measure with core adaptation benefits. Energy management contributes to the three pillars of
CSA: sustainable food productivity, resilience and mitigation, while enhancing food and nutritional security.

12. Climate-smart agriculture in
Zimbabwe—the way forward
12.1  Introduction
This chapter is based on the conclusions of all the preceding chapters of the Climate-smart Agriculture
Manual for University Level and Professional Level Agriculture Education in Zimbabwe. It is centred on
three broad categories namely: Enabling Environments; Systems Approaches and Practices.  The multi-
stakeholder approaches, steps and processes show that Zimbabwe as a country needs to stay abreast with
the global trends and developments in CSA as well as address the needs of its stakeholder communities
including higher and tertiary institutions of agriculture.
This chapter evaluates the CSA Manual’s approach vis-à-vis the Climate Technology Centre and Network
Response Plan to climate change keeping in mind the agents (individuals and institutions) through whom
desirable change can be wrought.  This chapter also explains what the targeted readers of the Manual
must do regardless of the barriers they may contend with to put CSA knowledge into practice.
The 11 chapters in the Manual will surely facilitate the development of methodologies associated with climate
change mitigation and adaptation, food security, and sustainable development. The focus of the Manual
is to highlight the importance of assessing the mitigation and adaptation benefits of identified practices
which increase productivity. The barriers to their adoption as well as the incentives available are clearly
enunciated, as are its positive impacts on food security, income, and livelihoods of rural and commercial
farmers, and smallholders in particular. Some of the CSA concepts discussed are: zero tillage, raised bed
planting, crop residue management or mulching, crop diversification (horticulture, mushroom cultivation,
etc.), agroforestry, nutrient management, water management (drip irrigation), rangeland management,
seed bank nurturing, advisories based on improved weather forecasting and ICT, general capacity building
and knowledge sharing, energy management and efficiency, and fisheries and aquaculture.
12.2  Background of the chapter themes
Agricultural production and productivity are reliant on the conditions of climate, soils, crops, livestock and
others, and also on the actions of mankind within a changing climate.
The CSA Manual was developed as the result of a series of national stakeholder workshops which involved
participants from various agricultural sectors. These participants included the offices of the President and
Cabinet; Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development; Ministry of Environment, Water
and Climate;  AGRITEX; UN Agencies; seed companies; civil society organisations; academia; farmers’
organisations; research institutions; and the media.
In order to address the three themes of CSA as per definition, the Manual focuses on the three categories
alluded to above, enabling environment, systems approach and practices. In attempting to address climate
change in the agricultural sector, the CSA Manual also draws on Zimbabwe’s agricultural productivity
landscape. Weather-based index insurance, gender and social inclusion, climate information services are
also looked into comprehensively.

Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Zimbabwe
12.3  Key challenges in implementing CSA in Zimbabwe
••
Lack of skilled human resources. Many smallholder farmers continue to follow environmentally
unsustainable conventional tillage, unsustainable water management practices, cutting down of
trees, use of slash and burn methods, and flood irrigation (in a water-stressed region) which further
increases forest degradation and soil infertility due to low soil moisture content.
••
Lack of adequate institutional and technological capacity to maximise germplasm of crop and
livestock as well as the absence of climate change mitigation and adaptation education, information,
and training in colleges of agriculture, universities and extension services.
••
In many parts of Zimbabwe livestock husbandry consists of open grazing, land degradation and the
loss of forest cover. This often leads to the releasing of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,  thus
buttressing the fact that livestock rearing is a major source of global methane emissions.
••
Lack of knowledge and access to credit and climate finance which can increase and sustain adoption
of CSA measures.
••
Gender inequality is an important factor because women face an unequal playing field vis-à-vis lack
of land ownership and tenure, access to inputs, resources and credit, education, and extension
services in some instances.
••
There is a yawning gap in the lack of documentation of traditional soil and water conservation
methods. A  good example of this are the “Zephania Phiri pits” described in Chapter 6 of this Manual.
Farming activities around the otherwise arid lands in the area were transformed through Phiri’s
innovations. However, his methods are only documented sketchily. The methods could be used
for upscaling CSA practices in the country. There is often limited information and documented
experience about alternative techniques that can aid the adoption of CSA practices. These need to
be studied, documented and shared.
••
The costs involved in the adoption of most CSA practices are a major barrier as in most cases
the accruing benefits are not realised until some years later. Among these costs are opportunity
costs of land and labour, upfront cash outlays that in most cases are out of reach of smallholder
farmers. When all is said and done the promotion of CSA technologies tend to cost more than what is
proffered in climate change literature. The ideal situation would be the adoption of CSA technologies
that can be leveraged with earmarked funds for the promotion of these practices at the national level.
There is therefore a need for greater access to finance at different phases of the growing period.
12.4 Conclusions
••
Zimbabwe has moved in the right direction by incorporating climate change issues in national policies
and strategies, however, there are still notable gaps which need to be addressed. The policies
should be intertwined into agriculture extension guidelines and manuals in a way that resonates with
the vast majority of the rural farming population so that they embrace them in their farming practices.
••
In Zimbabwe there are projects and programmes that conduct and promote climate-smart agricultural
practices and technologies. However, these programmes and projects are being implemented in a
fragmented project-based manner which does not augur well for the adoption of CSA practices at
national level. Good examples of such projects and programmes are the Green Innovation Hub
(Muzarabani), Climate-smart Villages (Nkayi), and OneAcre Management (Gokwe North).
••
There are a number of institutions/organisations and government departments involved in sustainable
agriculture in Zimbabwe but they need to coordinate their endeavours in ways that mutually benefit
each other. As the situation stands, they seem to be duplicating many functions or worse still, working
at odds with each other in their operations.

12.5 Recommendations
a. 	 According to the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) Technical Assistance Response
Plan, the CSA Manual is expected to bring in consistency between sustainable agriculture, food
security and climate change policies in Zimbabwe. It will also assist in other issues, viz.:
i.	 Capacitate students from colleges of agriculture and higher and tertiary institutions to provide
CSA extension services;
ii.	 Increase CSA adoption in smallholder farming communities, rural villages, and agricultural
enterprises through training, monitoring and evaluation;
iii.	 Reduce GHG emissions in on-farm activities through CSA training, and water and energy
management; and
iv.	 Improve transfer of knowledge by current extension workers and increase agriculture productivity
in smallholder farming communities, rural villages and agriculture enterprises.

With respect to post-assistance plans and actions, NGOs like Green Impact Trust and other interested
organisations could utilise the CSA Manual as follows:
i.	 In consultation with the Zimbabwe Government develop a CSA Policy and Strategy or Framework;
ii.	 Promote Green Impact Trust student exchange programmes within Africa and in  South-South
cooperation so as to share experiences and integrate solutions to develop agriculture;
iii.	 Increase stakeholder awareness of CSA across the value chain, especially in rural communities;
iv.	 Develop CSA demonstration centres in all government-run colleges of agriculture across the
country;
v.	 Develop CSA demonstration centres in traditional chief’s homesteads; and
vi.	Develop a climate-smart village as model for rural development.
b. 	 CSA needs to be integrated into main government strategies, guidelines, manuals and development
plans. In this regard, it is commendable that the MoAMD recognised this need and asked for the
development of this CSA Manual for agriculture institutions and extension cadres. Priority needs to
be given to CSA practices that enhance productivity, resilience as well as GHG emissions.
c.  	 Some measures are required to bring the livestock sector in line with  climate-change responses.
These include improving production and feeding systems, breeding of low methane-emitting animals
as well as introducing manure management methods that enhance reduction of emissions. Efforts
should also be made towards introducing restricted grazing so as to avoid overgrazing which results
in land degradation, and crop residue removal associated with open grazing.
d. 	 It is important to have a proactive platform for governmental institutions, NGOs, donors, private
sector and civil society organisations in Zimbabwe to fill gaps and enhance collective action on CSA.
Such a platform would enable the existing sustainable agriculture implementing institutions to share
information, knowledge and experience which is crucial.
e. 	 In order to overcome these challenges, we continue to urge the Zimbabwe Government to introduce
targeted programmes for the much needed CSA practices for small/marginal farmers. This will
require significant Government innovative interventions and investments across policy, regulatory
and infrastructural aspects of the agricultural and allied sectors.
