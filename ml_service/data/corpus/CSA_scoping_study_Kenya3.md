Climate Smart Agriculture in Kenya

Scoping Study on Climate-Smart Agriculture in
Smallholders Integrated Crop-Livestock Farming Systems

Kenya National Workshop on
Climate Change and Agriculture
9th October 2014, Nairobi

Objectives of the Scoping Study
• To identify and analyze Climate-Smart Agriculture initiatives
taking place in Kenya, including policies, strategies, programs,
projects and actions

• To gather examples of Climate-Smart Agriculture practices in
non-ASAL smallholder integrated crop-livestock farming
systems

Climate-Smart Agriculture
CSA is an integrative approach to address the interlinked
challenges of food security and climate change, and has three
objectives:
1. Sustainably increasing agricultural productivity
2. Adapting and building resilience of agricultural systems
3. Reducing GHG emissions

+ on multiple scale: farm to landscape, local to global, short
and long term

+ considering national and local context and priorities

GHG Emissions in Kenya
• Agriculture and forestry are the largest emitters
(2010) mainly due to emissions from livestock
(methane) and land use change/deforestation
(fuelwood, charcoal production and agricultural
expansion)

• GHG emissions will rise as Kenya achieves its
development goal as specified in the Kenya Vision
2030

GHG Emissions in Kenya

Policies relevant to Agriculture & Climate Change
•
The constitution of Kenya: Chapter five on Land and Environment – for
sustainable NRM; tree cover of at least 10% of the land area of Kenya; indigenous
knowledge of biodiversity and the genetic resources of the communities

•
The National Land Policy: Intensification of use in high-potential, densely
populated areas, through the application of efficient methods; improvement of the
condition and productivity of degraded lands in rural and urban areas; application
of cost-effective irrigation methods in areas of low agricultural potential

•
CAADP Compact (of NEPAD): Land and water management; incorporating
Climate-Smart Agriculture into national and local programs

•
Kenya Vision 2030: Environmental issues in general

•
National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS, 2010): Various measures
for adapting agriculture to climate change, and for mitigating the emissions of
greenhouse gases in agriculture

Policies relevant to Agriculture & Climate Change
•
Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (2010): Sustainable Land and
Natural Resource Management – borrows heavily from the NCCRS

•
National Food and Nutrition Policy (2011): recognizes climate change as
an emerging issue for food and nutrition security; advocates for adaptation;
recognizes the role of mitigation in addressing climate change

•
National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP, 2012): to implement the
NCCRS

•
Draft National Climate Change Framework Policy (2014): Policy
statements to enhance climate resilience and adaptive capacity; to promote
low carbon growth; and to mainstream climate change into planning
processes

Priority Actions Identified for Low Carbon
Climate Resilient Development Pathway in the
KCCAP 2013-2017 www.kccap.info
4/6 options related with agriculture and environment:

-
Climate-smart agriculture and agroforestry
-
Restoration of forest and degraded lands
-
Improved water resource management
-
Clean energy solutions (incl. improved cook stoves and biogas
digesters)
-
Geothermal power generation
-
Infrastructure

Adaptation Options Proposed in the KCCAP
• Agroforestry
• Conservation agriculture, and integrated soil fertility mgmt.
• Drought tolerant crops
• Water harvesting
• Drip irrigation
• Price stabilization scheme for livestock
• Strategic food reserve
• Index-based weather insurance
• Climate information

Selected Practices for Mitigation in the KCCAP
(and estimated emissions reduction by 2030)
•
Restoration of forest on degraded lands 30 Mt CO2 eq per year in
2030
•
REDD+: avoid deforestation 6.1 Mt CO2 eq, and forest degradation
1.6 Mt CO2 eq
•
Agroforestry: 4.2 Mt CO2 eq and increase tree cover to 10% of total
land area (Kenya Constitution 2010)
•
Conservation tillage + limiting use of fire on cropland 1.2 Mt CO2 eq
•
Rangement mgmt.: 1.1 Mt CO2 eq
•
Improved cook stoves and biogas
•
Mainstream CC into agricultural extension services
=> with sustainable development and climate resilience benefits

Many initiatives have elements
of CSA but are not calling them
CSA, or using a climate change
lens

Challenges facing CSA

• Climate finance internationally and nationally
• Land tenure security that make investments worthwhile
• Estimating only parts/segments of the whole farm system omits
potential elements/benefits
• Access to knowledge, information & practices
• Estimating benefits of CSA
• Others..

But many synergies and opportunities!

Next steps to move forward from the KCCAP
•
Operational national CC secretariat within the coordinating ministry
responsible for coordination and national reporting obligations
•
Develop knowledge sharing system and a capacity development
strategy
•
Mainstream CSA in planning processes at national and sub-national
levels
•
Identify and remove barriers for adaptation and mitigation
•
Put in place a national performance and benefit measurement
system (NPBM) for MRV of adaptation, mitigation and synergies
•
Encourage investment in climate-smart agriculture and set up a
national climate fund and carbon trading platform
•
Move the action plan forward via climate finance mechanisms like
GCF, AF, NAMAs, and REDD+

Status on NAPs and NAMAs
National Adaptation Plans (NAPs):
•
Proposed actions in KCCAP 2012 informed the drafting of the National
Adaptation Plan
– A comprehensive National Adaptation Plan (NAP) has been drafted
for Kenya to accompany the NCCAP based on assessments of
development needs and climate vulnerability
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs):
•
KCCAP considered the development of NAMAs for mitigation priority
actions e.g.:
- Climate-smart agriculture and agroforestry
- Livestock (idea on the table)
- Restoration of forest and degraded lands
- Clean energy solutions
•
NAMA framework development is still in the pipeline
