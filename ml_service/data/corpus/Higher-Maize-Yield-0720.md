Land prepared in readiness
for maize planting.
LAND
PREPARATION
•	 Start field preparation 2 to
3 weeks before the start of
the rainy season.
•	 First clear overgrown
weeds, shrubs and stumps.
They can be ploughed
back to the soil to build
soil organic matter.
•	 Plough land when it
is dry to minimize soil
compaction.
•	 Till the soil uniformly to a
depth of 20 to 30 cm.
•	 Tilling helps to control
weeds, kill some insects
and also makes it easier to
incorporate manure, apply
fertilizer, and plant.
•	 If large clods form after
the first ploughing, a
second ploughing, or
harrowing is necessary to
break the clods.
•	 Weeds can also be
controlled by use of
herbicides. After weeds
are killed with herbicides,
the seeds can be planted
directly without tilling land.
This practice is known
as no-till or conservation
agriculture.

SEED
SELECTION &SEED
R
A T E
•	 Plant newly purchased seed every season instead of
recycling old grain.
•	 Care should be taken to ensure that the purchased planting
seeds are certified. This can be accomplished by checking
for certification details on the pack and buying from
certified seed dealers.
•	 Read the instructions on the seed packet to understand
the seeding rate, the genetic potential, the suitable agro-
ecological zone and the expiry date of the seed.
•	 Using high quality seeds that are adapted to the local
environment is crucial for good germination and high yields.
•	 Select seeds suitable for the target agro-ecological zone, for
example arid and semi-arid lands require drought-tolerant
seed varieties, while high-rainfall zones require varieties that
can withstand high rainfall (Table 1).
•	 The seeding rate depends on the plant spacing used. In
areas with high yield potential, the recommended inter-row
spacing is 75 cm and the recommended distance between
the plants is 25 cm.
•	 In arid and semi-arid regions and other low rainfall zones,
the recommended spacing between the rows is 90 cm and
the distance between the plants is 30 cm.
•	 A spacing of 75 cm row to row and 25 cm between plants in
a row should be used where the target is to have one plant
per row.
•	 The distance between the plants should be doubled to 50 cm
where farmers intend to retain 2 plants per hole.
•	 Planting holes should be about 5 cm deep.

Planting
At planting, the right fertilizers are phosphorus-rich sources
like diammonium phosphate (DAP), monoammonium
phosphate (MAP), triple superphosphate (TSP), NPK
fertilizers such as 23-23-0 or 17-17-17. At this stage,
phosphorus is crucial for root establishment. Good root
growth is crucial for crops to take up nutrients and water.
Crops with poor root establishment and development
may show symptoms of nutrient deficiencies, even when
nutrients are in good supply.
•	 Nitrogen and phosphorus are the most important
nutrients for maize production. The two account for more
than 70% of the maize grain yield.
•	 Balanced fertilization with fertilizers that contain other
nutrients, like secondary and micro-nutrients enable the
crop to get balanced nourishment and attain high yields.
•	 In cases where the nutrient source is a bulk blended
multinutrient fertilizer, the blend should be mixed
thoroughly to ensure proper distribution of the granules
in every fertilizer scoop.

Examples of two multinutrient fertilizer blends with macro, secondary, and micro
nutrients. Depending on the fertilizers constituting the blend, the appearance could
be different.
•	 Potassium should be applied at planting especially where
soils are sandy and where low levels of potassium have
been detected through soil analysis.
•	 The lower the amount of P2O5 indicated on a bag of
fertilizer, the higher the number of fertilizer bags will be
required to meet the crop requirements.
•	 For regions that are prone to soil acidification, farmers
should apply approximately 2.5 tonnes of agricultural
lime per hectare (1000 kg/acre) after every three years.
Neutralizing excess soil acidity promotes healthy root
growth that ensures optimal response of crops to fertilizer.
t
t
Example: If the recommended phosphorus can be
met by applying two 50 kg bags fertilizer that has a
P2O5 concentration of DAP of 46% (DAP = 18-46-0),
then to provide the same rate of phosphorus using a
different fertilizer like NPK 23-23-0 that has a P2O5
concentration of 23%, four (50 kg) bags would be
required.
t

Top Dressing
•	 The right fertilizers for top dressing are nitrogen-
rich sources like calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN)
and urea. Urea (46% N) is the cheapest source of
nitrogen compared to CAN (27% N). In addition,
different fertilizer companies have developed special
multinutrient fertilizers for maize topdressing. Consult
your local extension officer or fertilizer company
agronomist for advice on other multinutrient fertilizers
available in your local market for topdressing.
•	 Top-dressing should be done when the soil is moist, to
enhance dissolution and uptake of nutrients.
•	 Nitrogen should be applied in 3 equal splits occurring
first at planting (can be applied as DAP) and 3 and 6
weeks after germination.
•	 Apply fertilizer around each plant about 5 cm away from
the plant.
•	 Avoid fertilizer getting into contact with the plant as it
could damage the plant as the fertilizer dissolves.
•	 Cover the fertilizer with soil to avoid losses of ammonia
nitrogen through volatilization.
•	 As shown in Table 2 and 3, the right fertilizer rate
is determined by the target yield and nutrient
concentration of the fertilizer.

Notes: Current/baseline yield assumed to be around 1 tonne per hectare. The estimates
are based on spacing of 75 cm between rows (intra-row) and 50 cm along rows (inter-row),
equivalent to 26,667 planting holes per hectare, with 2 plants per hole; 1 hectare = 2.47
acres. Fertilizer application for an acre for the same plant spacing/plant density can be cal-
culated by dividing the values presented in the Table by 2.47. (Adapted from Baijukya et
al, 2016)

Other Considerations for Fertilizer Use
•	 Fertilizer products are most effective, when used on soil
with a pH of 5.5 and above. If measurements indicate a
soil pH of less than 5.5, soils should be limed for better
crop response to fertilizers.
•	 For places where potassium is deficient, farmers could
use either NPK 17-17-17 applied basally, or a mixture
of DAP and KCl (potassium chloride or muriate of
potash).
•	 It is important to note that NPK 17-17-17 fertilizer has
less nitrogen and phosphorus than DAP. Since DAP
contains 46% P2O5 compared to 17% in NPK 17-17-17,
almost three times more NPK 17-17-17 is required to
provide the same amount of phosphorus.
•	 In addition to common fertilizers like DAP and TSP,
fertilizer companies in different regions have developed
multinutrient fertilizers that can be used specifically
for maize. These multinutrient fertilizers have the
additional benefit of supplying the secondary and micro
nutrients required for higher yields.
•	 Some of the most popular multinutrient fertilizers
containing, the macro, secondary, and micro nutrients
available for maize production in Kenya are listed in
Table 4.

• 	 To achieve high maize yields (above 5 t/ha) the crop will
also require secondary nutrients and micro nutrients.
•	 Where soils fail to meet the crop requirement for
secondary and micro nutrients, they should be applied
either as straight fertilizer or multinutrient fertilizer
sources.
•	 In addition to being a source of nitrogen and
phosphorus, some multinutrient fertilizers are also rich
in calcium, magnesium, sulphur, zinc, and boron.
•	 Micro nutrients are required in very small quantities but
their functions in crop growth are crucial for high yields.
•	 Follow the principles of 4R Nutrient Stewardship,
which provides guidelines on the best way to manage
fertilizers. Each “R” in 4R Nutrient Stewardship
summarizes a “Right” practice to consider while
providing nutrients to a crop. Nutrient applications
should equally consider the Right Source of nutrients
needed by a plant, the Right Rate needed to supply the
proper nutrient quantity, the Right Time to best match
plant nutrient uptake, and the Right Place to ensure
good accessibility of nutrients by plant roots. Farmers
can manage these four Rights for higher yield and
sustainable management of plant nutrition. Adopting 4R
management practices will result in increased crop yields
and incomes, and prevent soil nutrient depletion.

Example: One tonne of maize removes about 0.05
kg Zn/ha and thus application of about 2 kg/ha is
recommended every year. Zinc could be applied as
zinc sulphate.

•	 When available, manure and other organic resources should
be incorporated into the soil prior to planting.
•	 Organic matter improves the soil fertility, soil health and
the soil water-holding capacity.
•	 Note that most organic resources have low nutrient
concentrations and their nutrient release pattern does not
always match the nutrient needs of the crop at various
phases of crop growth.
•	 Unlike fertilizer nutrients, which are readily available to
plants, organic inputs need time to decompose and release
nutrients and are therefore a ‘slow release’ source of
nutrients.
•	 Application of both organic resources and inorganic
fertilizer (mineral fertilizer) is a preferred option for ensuring
that the soils remain fertile, the water-holding capacity
of the soil is high, and the crop has access to the required
nutrients in the right amounts throughout the growing
season.
•	 Using organic inputs in combination with fertilizers can
increase fertilizer use efficiency. When fertilizers are
applied in the presence of organic residues, more of the
nutrients contained in the fertilizer are taken up by the
crops.

• 	 The nitrogen concentration of most plant materials used as
green manure (from cereal straw to leguminous agroforestry
species and leguminous cover crops) range between 0.9%
and 4.5%. Therefore a tonne of dry biomass of such material
would supply between 9 and 45 kg of nitrogen.
•	 The phosphorus content of most plant materials used
as mulch (from cereal straw to leguminous agroforestry
species and leguminous cover crops) range between 0.07%
to 0.3%. Therefore a tonne of dry biomass of such material
would supply between 0.7 and 3 kg of phosphorus.
•	 Using these low nutrient organic materials alone
requires huge amounts of organic resources to meet any
large-scale production needs, which is not feasible for
the majority of farmers. Since inorganic fertilizers have
a high nutrient concentration, a 50 kg bag can provide
more nutrients than a tonne of organic resources.
t
t
t
Example: Fresh goat manure on average contains 7
kg P/t (equivalent to 16 kg/t P2O5). By comparison,
one tonne of triple superphosphate (TSP) fertilizer
contains 200 kg P or 460 kg P2O5. If the goal is to
apply 50 kg/ha P2O5, this could be delivered in about
3 tonnes of goat manure but just 109 kg TSP.

13
Spreading maize straw improves water retention and the straw adds useful nutrients
to soil when it decomposes.
•	 If the farmer does not have livestock and plans to buy animal manures,
it is worthwhile to compare the cost of nutrients in fertilizers and
animal manures and then select the most appropriate source. The value
of added organic matter on soil improvement is difficult to measure.

•	 Protect the plants from attack by rodents and birds using local
methods.
•	 At 10 days after planting, check for gaps along the rows and
plant additional seed to fill the gaps.
•	 Continuously check for pest and disease attack.
•	 Scout for pests by walking through the farm in a zig zag or ‘W’
route every week. Perforated leaves, the presence of larvae and
egg clusters, or large groups of insects are indicators of pests.
•	 Use appropriate treatments to reduce the effects of pest and
diseases on crop yield.
•	 Disease and pest control should be carried out in good time to
allow the crop time to recover.
•	 Weed the field at 3 and 6 weeks after seed germination. Shake
off soil from the weed roots to avoid regrowth of the weeds.
•	 Immediately after the first weeding, top dress the crop with
a third of the nitrogen fertilizer, for example urea or CAN.
Top-dress for the second time immediately after the second
weeding with the remaining a third of recommended nitrogen.

Water harvesting ridges hold water for extended periods after the cessation of rain.
•	 Tied ridges/water harvesting structures increase water
infiltration and improve crop rooting.
•	 Use wider spacing within and between the rows to reduce
competition for moisture, especially under drought
conditions: up to 1 meter between rows.
•	 Choose early-maturing varieties to avoid periods of drought.
•	 Nutrient-moisture interactions are crucial. In absence of
moisture the crop does not take up nutrients. It is therefore
advisable to top dress when the soil is moist.
•	 Harvested grain should be dried to about 13% moisture
content to avoid the possibility of fungal colonization of
stored maize.
