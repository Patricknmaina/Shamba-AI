EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The agriculture sector is a key to overall economic growth and development of Uganda.
The sector contributes 20.9 percent of the National Gross Domestic Product and 80
percent of the export earnings. Real growth in agricultural output has declined steadily,
from 7.9 percent in 2000/01 to 0.7 percent in 2007/08 (although it did show signs of
recovery in 2008/09, with a 2.6 percent growth rate). Agricultural production has
increased over the years and this increase is attributed to area expansion rather than
increase in productivity with over 95% of the farmers being smallholders with
landholdings averaging 2 ha.

The country has a total area of 241,551 km2 of which about 30% is highly degraded.
Available data between 1999 and 2006 indicate that trends of the major crops showed
positive increases for cereals (maize, millet, rice and sorghum), beans and simsim, while
there has been a significant decline noted for root crops (cassava, Irish and sweet
potatoes) as well as export crops (coffee and cotton). The livestock census of UBOS
(2009) showed that total cattle ownership increased by 54% since 2005, showing an
increasing trend of livestock integration into the farming systems. While fish exports
increased dramatically from 1991, there was a sharp decline, falling from a peak of
39,201 tons in 2005 to about 24,965 tons in 2008 as a consequence of overfishing leading
to falling stocks and declining catches. Lake Victoria continues to provide the biggest
percentage (41.8 percent) of total fish catch, which are dwindling fast, the situation for the other
lakes is even worse.

The country’s agricultural production system is diverse spread within14 Agro-ecological
Zones (AEZs). The zones are characterized by different farming systems determined by
soil types, climate, landforms, socio-economic and cultural factors. Poor agricultural land
management, increased extreme weather events, and population pressure have escalated
land degradation in all the AEZs. The AEZs experience varying levels of vulnerability to
climate-related hazards which include drought, floods, storms, and pests and diseases.
Furthermore, the International Climate Risk Report labels Uganda as one of the most
unprepared and most vulnerable countries in the world. Agriculture is the sector most
vulnerable to climate change due to its high dependence on climate and weather. Climate
projections show that agriculture systems will suffer with climate change, thus,
threatening food production systems and therefore the livelihoods and food security of
millions of people, especially women who depend on agriculture. Consistent warming
trends and more frequent and intense extreme weather events, particularly droughts and
floods have been observed across the country in recent decades. In line with these trends,
climate change scenarios consistently project temperature increases across the region,
which will require farmers to adapt to changing conditions.

Total dependence on rain-fed agriculture and poor soil health coupled with land
degradation increases vulnerability of farming systems and predisposes rural households

to food insecurity and poverty thus eroding their productive assets and weakening their
coping strategies and resilience. Increasingly, the onset, duration and intensity of these
rains vary considerably from year to year, while the frequency and intensity of the
extreme weather events such as drought and floods are on the increase with devastating
impacts on the national economy and the livelihoods of the people. Drastic and
innovative measures are needed to help farmers and consumers cope with the changes in
emerging and projected weather patterns. To address this challenge, the Government of
Uganda has identified six strategic priorities as sources of Uganda’s agricultural
development and growth in a changing climate. The six strategic priorities are:

Improved Productivity and incomes – a pro-growth, pro-poor development agenda that
supports agricultural sustainability and includes better targeting to climate change
impacts will improve resilience and climate change adaptation. Because climate change
has a negative impact on agricultural production, achieving any given food and nutrition
security target will require greater investments in agricultural productivity. Public and
private sectors as well as public-private partnerships will play a critical role.

Building resilience and associated mitigation co-benefits - CSA will help reduce
vulnerability of Uganda’s agriculture sector by increasing productivity, enhancing
adaptation and resilience of the farming systems and reducing emissions intensity in the
context of achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication.

Value Chain Integration - This approach is holistic in that it considers input supply,
production, agricultural services, marketing and business support services as necessary
building blocks. Under the approach, both public and private sectors are seen as critical
actors in the value chain. Knowledge and capacity building are critical strategic priorities
to leverage innovations and increase efficiencies. The approach also provides enabling
framework for integrating gender and the needs of the youth.

Research for Development and Innovations - Although Uganda has a well-developed
agricultural research system, use of modern science and climate smart technologies in
agricultural production is still limited. Inadequate research–extension–farmer linkages to
facilitate demand-driven research and increased use of improved technologies continue to
constrain efforts to increase agricultural productivity as farmers continue to use outdated
and ineffective technologies. The role of research will be re-oriented to support
innovations that facilitate the transition to climate-smart agriculture by smallholder
farmers. New and emerging agricultural research partnerships will identify technological
advances that respond to the impacts climate change and climate variability. A major
thrust will be use of climate-smart agricultural practices, promoting improved land
management and sustainable crop-livestock and fisheries intensification, in order to
bolster farmers’ adaptive capacity and support the national vision of achieving food
security.

Improving and sustaining agricultural advisory Services - Agro-advisory services that
include climate applications for agriculture will help farmers to make better and informed
decisions in the face of risks and uncertainties, in addition to the integrated management
of present and emerging pests and disease challenges. Climate applications include
seasonal weather forecasts, monitoring and early warning products for drought, floods
and pests and disease surveillance. These products and services would increase the
preparedness of the farmers, well in advance, to cope with risks and uncertainties. In this
regard, dissemination of agro-weather advisories and other climate-smart agricultural
practices will be enhanced through Public Private Partnerships. Furthermore, robust agro-
advisory services would catalyse private sector investment in priority areas such as
weather-based index insurance and associated infrastructure.

Improved Institutional Coordination – Improved institutional coordination is crucial for
achievement of horizontal and vertical integration required for effective discharge of the
CSA Programme. The achievement of horizontal integration requires a framework that
provides for high-level guidance while vertical integration is instrumental in determining
the roles of various sector institutions and devolved governments in performing CSA
mandates. The proposed coordination framework will improve Inter-Ministerial and
Local Government Coordination; enhance partnerships with private sector and civil
society organizations; and strengthen coordination with development partners.

1.0
INTRODUCTION
1.1
Background
Agriculture is vital for the development goals of promoting growth and reducing poverty
in Uganda. Agriculture supports the livelihoods of 73 percent of the households, provides
employment for about 33.8 % (UBOS, 2014) of the economically active population, and
over 80 percent of the poorest of the population. The proportional contribution of the
agricultural sector to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Uganda currently stands at
about 20.9 percent. The sector continues to maintain its historical reputation as the
primary driver of economic growth and poverty alleviation. Thus, the sector is most
important in terms of food security, employment, household income, raw materials for
local industry and exports to regional and international markets (Agriculture Policy,
2013).

Uganda has made great progress in terms of reducing the proportion of the population
below the national poverty line. The poverty headcount declined from 56% in 1992/1993
to 31% in 2005/2006. Levels of the poverty headcount are much higher in rural areas
compared to urban areas—34% and 14%, respectively—and the reduction over time has
been strongest in urban areas. Research has demonstrated that if agriculture in Uganda
grew at 6 percent per annum, the poverty rate would be cut by an additional 7.6
percentage to 18.9 percent, much lower than the 26.5 percent that would be reached if
agriculture continued to grow at the average rate of 2.7 percent per year experienced in
the last 8 years (IFPRI, 2008).

Uganda has a diverse agricultural production system within 14 Agro-ecological Zones
(AEZs). The zones are characterized by different farming systems determined by soil
types, climate, and socio-economic and cultural factors. The AEZs experience varying
levels of vulnerability to climate-related hazards which include drought, floods, storms,
and pests and diseases (GoU, 2007).  Total dependence on rain-fed agriculture increases
vulnerability of farming systems and predisposes rural households to food insecurity and
poverty. This is largely attributed to the consistently low yields of major staples (maize,
millet, sorghum, beans) and cash crops due to climate change and increasing weather
variability. High population growth estimated at 3.2% p.a has led to dwindling of the
average household landholding to less than 0.5 ha, accelerated land fragmentation and
soil nutrient-mining in areas with high production potential. The predominant
smallholder production system is therefore characterized by low use of external inputs
(such as improved seeds, agro-chemicals and fertilizer), poor land management practices
and rudimentary production tools which contribute to low agricultural productivity and
high post-harvest losses currently estimated at 30%. Furthermore, marketing
infrastructure and road networks in rural areas are still underdeveloped.

Uganda has the potential to transform from rain-fed agriculture by harnessing the
available water for irrigation. According to studies done by JICA, potential irrigable area
in Uganda is approximately 202,000 ha with only 14,418 ha under formal irrigation and

67,000 ha under informal irrigation, much of it for rice. The study further indicates that
while the total renewable water resources in Uganda is over 66 km3 only about 22 km3 is
being utilized (for both small and large scale initiatives). There is therefore great potential
and could build on the on-going SLM and CSA initiatives. The initiatives include: (1)
MAAIF-UNDP-GEF SLM project in the Cattle Corridor districts; (2) MAAIF- NARO-
WB- GEF SLM ATAAS Project (3) COMESA, UNDP and FAO project being piloted in
five districts in eastern Uganda and (4) the Cooperative league of the United States
(CLUSA) in northern Uganda and by Rural Enterprise Development Services (REDS)
with the support of development partners including Norway, DFID, EU and USAID. In
addition, the country has in place a suite of enabling macro-economic and sectoral
policies, strategies and action plans that aim to catalyze agricultural sector development
and growth in a changing climate.
1.2
Alignment with the CAADP, National Development Goal, Agriculture Sector
Policy and Climate Change Policy
This CSA Program is aligned to the national economic blue print – Uganda Vision 2040,
National Development Plan and agricultural sector vision and objectives. At the regional
level, the vision responds to the 23rd Ordinary African Union Assembly – Decisions and
Declaration (Malabo Declaration), in particular: Assembly/AU/Dec. 538 (XXIII) on
Climate Change and agriculture; Assembly/AU/Decl.1 (XXIII) on Accelerated
agricultural growth and transformation; and Assembly/AU/Decl.4 (XXIII) on Nutrition
security for Inclusive economic Growth and Sustainable Development. At the
international level, the CSA Program will contribute to Uganda’s efforts to adapt and
build resilience in agriculture under the National Adaptation plan (NAP), nationally
appropriate mitigation action and intended nationally determined contribution (INDC).
1.3 The process of preparing the CSA Programme
The preparation of the Uganda CSA programme stems from the concerted efforts being
made by the Government of Uganda to mainstream climate change considerations into
the national development planning and budget and sectoral policies, strategies,
programmes and plans. In preparing this CSA Program, joint Ministries of Agriculture,
Animal Industry and Fisheries and Water and Environment pursued a consultative
approach under the guidance of a multi-stakeholder/multi-disciplinary National CSA
Task Force. The Task Force Expert Team draws representation from relevant ministries
and departments, parastatals, civil society organization (CSOs), non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), community-based organized (CBOs), private sector, researchers,
academia and individuals.

The activities that informed the Program include: technical working sessions that carried
out a stocktaking of the sector’s programmes, strategies and performance from a
historical perspective, as well as an analysis of options for agricultural sector growth in a
changing climate. Consultative sessions were held with special interest groups, in
particular The National Treasury (NDA for GCF), GEF focal point, Ministry of Planning

Uganda Climate Smart Agriculture Program 2015 - 2025

(integration into development planning and budget), civil society organizations, umbrella
private sector organizations and devolved governments, national stakeholder workshops.

The preparation of the Country CSA Program was facilitated by the Expert Team with
technical and financial support from the NEPAD Climate Change Fund, the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), East African Community (EAC)
and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security
(CCAFS).

2.0 SITUATION ANALYS IS
2.1 General trends
The agricultural sector contributes 20.9% of the National Gross Domestic Product and
80% of the export earnings (UBOS, 2014). Over 95% of the farmers are smallholders
with land holdings averaging 2 ha (Kisamba-Mugerwa, 2001), with annual growth rate of
about 1.9% (UBOS, 2013). Despite the importance of agriculture in the economy of
Uganda, the sectors’ performance has not been impressive in the recent years. Real
growth rate in agricultural output declined from 7.9% in 2000/01 to 0.1% in 2006/07
(UBOS, 2008). However, the sector recovered and grew at 1.3% and 2.6% in 2007/08
and 2008/09 respectively. This growth of the agricultural sector is much below the NDP
annual growth target of 5.6% and the 5.9% growth rate that is required for effective
poverty reduction. The current real growth rate in agricultural output (2013/14) is
estimated at 2.9% (UBOS, 2014) and all these are below the 6% growth target of the AUs
Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP).

Results from the 2014 National Housing and Population Census puts Uganda’s
population at 34.9 million people and is one the fastest growing in the world at about
3.2%. While Uganda’s population is growing at 3.2% per annum, agricultural growth is
estimated at 2.9% p.a. Low agricultural production is largely due to declining soil fertility
attributed to soil degradation. This is driven by poor farming practices, over-cultivation
and low input use by farmers. Other causes of the yield gap were identified as weather
variability, and pests and diseases. Opportunities for opening up new land are reducing
and problems associated to climate change are becoming more pronounced. Average
temperatures in Uganda are likely to increase by up to 1.5oC in the next 20 years and up
to 4.3oC by 2080s (DFID, 2008). These pressures require that food production is
improved to be in tandem with population growth in a changing climate.

2.2 Agricultural production trends
2.2.1 Crop production
Although agricultural production has increased over the years, this increase is attributed
to area expansion rather than increase in productivity. For instance, in 2012 total area
planted of food crops increased by 2 percent to 5,729,000 ha. Between 1999/2000 and
2005/06, the production trends of the major crops have been mixed. While positive
increases were recorded for cereals (maize, millet, rice and sorghum), beans and simsim,
significant declines were noted for root crops (cassava, Irish and sweet potatoes).  The
performance of crop yields1 is also mixed. Between 1999 and 2006 eight major crops
showed substantial reductions in yield while only simsim registered a significant
increase.

scepticism about the size of the variation and to what extent this represents the underlying trend.

2.2.2 Industrial crop production and exports
Coffee, Tea, Cocoa and palm oil are the main perennial crops for export in Uganda.
Overall there was an increase in Coffee volumes (60 kg Bags) exported from 3.3 million
bags in FY2012/13 to 3.6 Million bags in FY2013/14. However due to declining world
coffee market prices the total earnings dropped by 4% from USD 422million in FY
2012/13 to USD 404 Million in 2013/14 and climate change is likely to exacerbate the
decline in coffee production. The Uganda Tea Authority indicates an increase of 5% from
6970 Metric Tonnes in 2012/13 to 64,000 Metric tonnes in 2013/14 with corresponding
increase in earnings from USD 107,994 Million to 113,920 million in the same period.

Cocoa production increased by 13% from 19,430 Metric Tonnes in 2012/13 to 22,010MT
in2013/14. All the Cocoa produced was exported earning the country USD 58Million
compared to USD 46 Million in 2013/14 indicating an increase of 26% in revenue. The
total area of Oil Palm planted by small holders now stands at 3,863 Ha while the nucleus
estate stands at 6440 ha bringing the total area of oil palm to 10,303 ha. Smallholder
farmers have so far harvested a total 28,498 MTs of fresh fruit bunches that have fetched
UGX 11.1 Billion Shillings only. Overall there is a general increase in industrial crop
production and export.

Cash crops production is increasing as a result of increase in areas under production
rather than productivity increase. This is contributing to reduction in arable land under
food crops/food security. Increasing population is putting pressure to the current
production systems and other natural resources in a non-sustainable way. There is need to
improve per capita productivity in a changing climate.

2.2.3 Horticultural crops production
A wide range of horticultural crops are produced in nearly all parts of the country
throughout the year with practically no irrigation or fertilizer. These include citrus,

papaws, mangoes, pineapples, tomatoes, okra, carrots, pepper, cabbages, bananas, and a
variety of other indigenous vegetables. Currently, the export of horticultural products is
one of the fastest growing export, sub-sectors in the country (estimated at 20 percent per
annum).

2.2.4 Livestock production
Livestock share to the GDP is currently projected at 1.7 percent. In recent years livestock
population growth rates have been estimated to grow at 1.4, 2.5, 4.3 and 3.0 for cattle,
sheep, goat and chicken, respectively. Productivity of livestock is still low. The most
recent livestock census projected average milk production per milked cow per week to be
around 8.5 litres and egg rates per week at 4 and 5 for exotic layers and indigenous
chicken, respectively. The low productivity was mainly attributed to the dominance of
indigenous breeds estimated at 93.6 percent and 87.7 percent for cattle and chicken,
respectively. Furthermore, poor feeding and nutrition is still a big challenge across all
breed types due to seasonal availability of feed resources and remains the biggest
limitation to investment in exotic chicken and dairy. This challenge is likely to be
exacerbated by climate change.

2.2.5 Fish production
Ugandan fishery sector has been majorly from natural water bodies (Table 7). Fisheries
activities are mainly carried out in open water sources comprising of five major lakes
(Victoria, Albert, Kyoga, Edward and George), which are the main sources of fish in the
country. Uganda is endowed with proportionately large open water resource accounting
for 15.1% of the total surface area. Lake Victoria continues to be the most important
water body in Uganda, both in size and contribution to the fish catch followed by Lake
Albert, and then Lake Kyoga. Whereas, Lake Victoria, Albert and Edward have recorded
steady growth in fish catches in recent years, fish catches in Lake Kyoga, George and
Kazinga channel are declining. Lakes account for 90% of the total fish catch. The main
challenge for natural wild catch is over fishing and use of poor traditional methods of
capture. The other threat is posed by proliferation of the water hyacinth which affects fish
breeding sites and recruitment.

2.3.1 Levels of food consumption
Eighty nine percent of the population in Uganda is minimally food insecure (IPC phase
1). This population still has normal access to food from own production and the market.
Ten percent of the total population in the country is in phase 2 (stressed).

2.3.2 Nutrition trends
According to the 2006 UDHS, 38% of children under 5 years in Uganda are stunted, 16%
are underweight, and 6% are wasted. 50% of women and 73% of children less than 5
years are anemic. One out of every five children (20%) and 1 out of every 5 women
(20%) are vitamin A deficient. Countries with wide spread iron deficiency as it is the case
in Uganda are known to lose 2% of their GDP every year due to poor learning ability and
low productivity due to iron deficiency.
2.4 Enabling Policy Environment
Enabling environment for CSA at the macro level is anchored in various National and
sectoral policies and legal frameworks drawing inspiration from the National Vision 2040
and the National Development Plan (NDP). Below are the key national and sectoral

(NDP)

The National Development Plan seeks to address structural
bottlenecks in the economy in order to accelerate socio-economic
transformation for Prosperity. During the period of the plan the
investment priorities inter alia include physical infrastructure
development mainly in the energy and transport sectors; facilitating
availability and access to critical production inputs especially in the
agriculture and industry sector as well as promotion of science and
technology innovation.
Prosperity for All
The cardinal principle of Prosperity for All (PFA) is to identify and
support economic enterprises that will enable households to earn
daily, periodic and long-term income, with a target of UGX 20
million per household per year. To achieve the PFA vision, all
government agencies and local governments must implement
existing programs in an integrated manner and with a higher level
of efficiency in order to bring about economic transformation,
especially in rural areas.

and other ecosystem services. The U-SLM SIF is a multi-sector
(agriculture, water and environment, lands, energy and trade)
national initiative spearheaded by MAAIF to implement the
CAADP and TerrAfrica. The U-SIF SLM aims at providing an
integrated cross-sectoral approach to investing in solutions to
crosscutting SLM challenges. It also aims at scaling-up and
mainstreaming SLM into the center of the national development
agendas.

2.5
Constraints to agriculture sector development
2.5.1 Land degradation and soil health
Land degradation and soil fertility or nutrient depletion are recognized as a major
impediment to increasing land productivity, food security and natural resource
conservation. The country has a total area of 241,550.7 Km2 of which about 30% is
highly degraded. Poor agricultural land management, increased extreme weather events,
and population pressure have escalated land degradation in all the AEZs. The estimated
average depletion rates for Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P) and Potassium (K) in Uganda
are -21, -8, and -43kg/ha-1yr-1(Smaling et al., 1997; Wortmann and Kaizzi, 1998). More
use of inorganic fertilizer, supplemented with soil and water conservation and organic
nutrient supplementation, is central to realizing the productivity and yield increases
required to override the current situation. Application of mineral fertilizers is an effective
means to reverse soil nutrient depletion and improve land productivity and has been
credited for much of the sustained increases in per capita food production in Asia and
Latin America (Sanchez et al. 1997), yet currently, only 2% of smallholders use inorganic
fertilizer in Uganda (UBOS, 2006).

Figure 1: Estimated average depletion rates for Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P) and Potassium
(K) in Uganda

2.5.2 Climate change
Global projections downscaled to Uganda generally reveal a small increase or possible
small decrease in annual rainfall in the future (Figure 2). There are indications, however

Uganda Climate Smart Agriculture Program 2015 - 2025

14

that there may be an increase in precipitation during December, January, and February,
which historically has been the dry season across the country (Figure 3). This increase
could have a significant impact on livestock and agriculture — especially on perennial
crops and post-harvest activities.

Figure 2: Climate change impacts in Uganda on precipitation in Uganda under lower (RCP 4.5)
and higher (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The thick black lines represent the
average of 29 different climate models, whereas the grey box and dashed lines represent the
range of climate models. Although precipitation is projected to increase by most climate
models, the timing of precipitation is also changing with some months projected to decrease

emissions scenario based on an ensemble of 19 climate models from the IPCC Fifth Assessment
Report. The darker bars represent months with greater average precipitation (from Climate
Wizard, CIAT, 2015).
2.5.3 Climate Impacts to Crops
Human induced climate change is likely to increase average temperatures in Uganda by
1.5 ºC within the next 15 years and by up to 3.5 ºC by the 2080s, although some climate
models project temperature increases as high as 5.8 ºC. Such rates of increase are
unprecedented. Increased temperatures will also lead to greater rates of evaporation and
transpiration, which can cause greater moisture stress and rainfall deficits. Most recently
in 2010 -2011 damages and losses from rainfall deficits in the agricultural sector were
valued at USD 907 million accounting for 77% of the total damages and losses across all
economic sectors (World Bank, 2010-11 integrated Rainfall variability impact needs
assessment by the department of disaster management OPM).

(RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The thick black lines represent the average of
29 different climate models, whereas the grey box and dashed lines represent the range of
climate models. Although precipitation is projected to increase by most climate models, the
timing of precipitation is also changing with some months projected to decrease
According to the International Climate Risk Report, Uganda is one of the most
unprepared and most vulnerable countries in the world (CIGI, 2007). Yet among the most
vulnerable countries, Uganda has the least adaptive capacity, making adaptation the most
immediate priority for the country. The most dominant and widespread disaster due to

Uganda Climate Smart Agriculture Program 2015 - 2025

16

climate change is drought, whose frequency is observed to be on the increase, for
example seven droughts were experienced between 1991 and 2000 (GoU, 2007). The
2010/11 drought affected an estimated 2 – 2.5% of national GDP.

Agricultural crop modelling shows that climate change has impacts depending on the
crop. Beans are projected to experience the greatest decreases due to climate change, with
the potential for a decrease of up to a 70% in suitable for production by 2040-2069
(Figure below). In contrast, millet, banana and groundnut is projected to increase in
suitable area, albeit only slightly (5-10%). Above ground biomass is also projected to
decease across most of Northern Uganda (Figure 5), which would have great negative
implications for livestock in those areas.

Figure 5: Percent change in suitable area for major crops in Uganda due to climate change. The
red line represents the average projected change and the blue box and dashed lines represent
uncertainty associated with the crop modelling. Analysis provide by J. Vargas, CIAT

The frequency and severity of
floods have also been observed to
be increasing. For example, the
floods experienced across the country in 2010 affected 50,000 people while 350 people
died in the same year due to landslides. Changes in temperature have also had significant
impacts on health and agriculture. The country has also seen unprecedented outbreaks of
pests and diseases, such as the Coffee Wilt Disease, Banana Bacterial Wilt, etc. in recent
years that are likely to be a consequence of climatic change. Other out breaks of pests and
diseases that have occurred possibly due to climate change include: the Rift Valley Fever,
FMD, ECF, Cassava Mosaic, etc. Uganda’s ecosystems are also changing and
biodiversity loss is on the increase due to extreme droughts and unsustainable agricultural
practices. There has also been unprecedented disappearance of plant species, particularly
medicinal plants and pastures and increase in invasive weeds.

Women and Youth in Uganda play a vital role in agriculture, providing most of the
labour force. Generally, women contribute about 65% to agricultural production and
processing, consequently they are more vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate
change.  This is exacerbated by cultural limitations to women and youth in decision
making and of limited access to and control over the returns from land. With a growing
population of unemployed youth, this calls for a paradigm shift in agricultural
development models.  Government prioritization of SLM and the new orientation towards
CSA provide an opportunity to address inequalities related to women and youth besides
increasing productivity and incomes and reducing emissions from the agriculture sector.

Building resilience in the agriculture sector is of paramount importance as risks and
vulnerabilities to agricultural and livelihood systems due to climate change are on the
increase. .Development of appropriate early warning systems and contingency plans
would be critical. There is need to enhance and improve the National Early Warning
system in Uganda coordinated in MAAIF in cooperation with the Uganda National
Meteorological Authority (UNMA) and the Disaster Preparedness Department so as to
ensure that timely climate information, including seasonal forecasts reaches the users
especially small scale farmers. In addition, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network
(FEWS NET)the leading provider of early warning and analysis on food insecurity has
helped to develop the national livelihood zones and baselines, which have been
consecutively used (2010, 2011 and 2012) for seasonal outcome analysis assessments.
Other initiatives are also being piloted, including a community Early Warning System in
Karamoja region by MAAIF, ACTED and OPM.

Emissions from agriculture come from four principal sectors, namely, agricultural soils,
livestock and manure management, rice cultivation, and the burning of agricultural
residues and open burning from land use clearing. The largest shares of emissions
originate from agricultural soils (N2O), enteric fermentation (the natural digestive
processes of ruminants such as cattle and sheep) and rice production associated with CH4

emissions. It is expected that these emissions will increase because of increased food
demand and increased prioritization of rice, meat and dairy production (MAAIF, 2010).
This shift will also lead to increased pressure on natural land resources notably, forests,
wetlands, and grasslands from agricultural expansion.

MAAIF GHG Mitigation Plan
The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) in Uganda; in an
effort to reduce emissions from the agricultural sector across the country and to fulfil its
mandate as the lead government agency responsible for the management of the
agricultural sector, has developed a GHG mitigation plan(2015) to guide agricultural
development with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.  It is clear that anthropogenic
emissions from agriculture sector, in Uganda, are the principal drivers’ of  climate change
and this plan is one of those activities intended to address the mandate of MAAIF to
promote and support sustainable and market oriented agricultural production, food
security and household incomes.
This plan is informed by the results of the Agricultural Sector Scoping Study that has just
been completed by a team of consultants. In this plan, MAAIF details:
1. Realistic plans for reducing emissions from the agricultural sector;
2. The strategies the ministry will take to reduce emissions by 10 percentage below the 2014
levels;
3. The steps that it will take to monitor its progress towards achieving the recommended
targets, and;
4. A funding plan to mobilize resources that will facilitate the achievement of the
recommended targets.

MAAIF estimates that total emissions from the agricultural sector were nearly 498.29,
29.47 and 1033.32 Gg for Methane, Nitrous oxide and Carbon dioxide, respectively, in
2008 and these increased exponentially by 30.6, 72.8 and 287.5%, respectively, in 2014.
Most of these emissions are attributed to livestock enteric fermentation, manure
management, savannah burning and rice cultivation. The mitigation plan presents short-
term and long-term emissions reduction goals to guide agricultural development
programmes and other decision making processes through 2040. The goals are in line
with government development interventions including National Development Planning
processes and Vision 2040.
Two main goals of the plan are:
1. Short-term 2025 goal: To reduce emissions by 10 percent below the 2014 levels by 2025
2. Long term 2040 goal: To reduce emissions by 30 percent below the 2014 levels by 2040.

2.5.4 Agricultural finance and investment
Investing in agriculture is key to achieving poverty reduction and food security in
Uganda. Studies have shown that public spending provides leverage for other
investments. Since the year 2000 investment in agriculture has been guided by the PMA
whose main objective was poverty reduction through agricultural commercialization. The
PMA recognized the need for investment in other sectors outside agriculture for example
roads, financial services, energy, NRM and agricultural education.  The findings of the
poverty eradication action plan evaluation (GOU, 2008) indicate that the allocation of
public expenditure to agriculture can reduce poverty in a number of ways, including by
raising produced output in those sectors on which the poor depend most for employment.

The share of approved domestic agriculture budget to the total domestic budget shows a
declining trend way below the recommended 10% of annual government expenditure to
the agriculture sector (Maputo Declaration, 2003). For instance the share declined from
3.8% in FY 2012/13 to 3.3% in FY 2013/14. The gap between MTEF and approved share
has also been widening e.g. 366.8 bn approved to 289.3 bn in 2010/11; 440.7 bn and
294.6 bn in 2011/12 and 630.9 bn and 315 bn in 2013/14.

Consequently, the trend of agriculture financing through other mechanisms and the sector
proportional contribution to the national GDP is also declining. This trend is likely to
continue because of the government medium term prioritization in financing the energy
sector and infrastructure for accelerated growth of industry and trade. It is therefore
expected that much of the investments will have to come from the private sector.
Allocation of credit to agriculture from the formal financial institutions is very low. There
is no crop insurance although much of the country’s agriculture is rain-fed and is
therefore subject to shocks of drought and floods.
2.6
Agricultural Growth potential and sources of Growth
A paradigm shift from the current agricultural practices holds the future of Uganda’s
agriculture sector. High dependence on rain-fed agriculture and poor soil health increases
vulnerability of farming systems and predisposes rural households to food insecurity and
poverty thus eroding their productive assets and weakening their coping strategies and
resilience. Increasingly, the onset, duration and intensity of rains vary considerably from
year to year, while the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as drought
and floods are on the increase with devastating impacts on the national economy and the
livelihoods of the people. Moreover agricultural seasons in some areas of the country are
expected to shift.  Drastic and innovative measures are needed to help farmers and
consumers cope with the changes in emerging and projected weather patterns. In
addition, women and youth in Uganda play a vital role in agriculture, Government
prioritization of SLM and the new orientation towards CSA provide an impetus for
inclusive agricultural growth that not only targets increasing productivity, building
resilience and reducing emissions intensity but will also strive to address inequalities
related to women and youth engagement in the agriculture sector.

VISION AND OBJECTIVE S
3.1
Vision
The Vision of the CSA Program is a “Climate resilient and low carbon agricultural
and food systems contributing to increased food security, wealth creation and
sustainable economic growth in line with the National Vision 2040.”
3.2
Objectives
The five core objectives of the Country CSA Programme are:
1. Increase agricultural productivity through climate smart agriculture practices and
approaches that consider gender
2. Increase the resilience of agricultural landscapes and communities to the impacts
of climate change
3. Increase the contribution of the agricultural sector to low carbon development
pathways through transformation of agricultural practices.
4. Strengthen the enabling environment4 for efficient and effective scaling up of
climate smart agriculture.
5. Increase partnerships and resource mobilization initiatives to support
implementation of climate smart agriculture.

Thus, Uganda CSA Programme aims to build resilience of agricultural farming systems
for enhanced food and nutrition security through six Programmatic Result Areas, namely:

Result Area 1: Improved Productivity and incomes – a pro-growth, pro-poor
development agenda that supports agricultural sustainability and includes better targeting
to climate change impacts will improve resilience and climate change adaptation.
Because climate change has a negative impact on agricultural production, achieving any
given food and nutrition security target will require greater investments in agricultural
productivity. Public and private sectors as well as public-private partnerships will play a
critical role.

Result Area 2: Building resilience and associated mitigation co-benefits - CSA will
help reduce vulnerability of Uganda’s agriculture sector by increasing productivity,
enhancing adaptation and resilience of the farming systems and reducing emissions
intensity in the context of achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication.

Result Area 3: Value Chain Integration - This approach is holistic in that it considers
input supply, production, agricultural services, marketing and business support services
as necessary building blocks. Under the approach, both public and private sectors are
seen as critical actors in the value chain. Knowledge and capacity building are critical

23

strategic priorities to leverage innovations and increase efficiencies to reduce the
greenhouse gas emissions intensity from agriculture and food systems. The approach also
provides enabling framework for integrating gender and the needs of the youth in value
chain businesses.

Result Area 4: Research for Development and Innovations - Although Uganda has a
well-developed agricultural research system, use of modern science and climate smart
technologies in agricultural production is still limited. Inadequate research–extension–
farmer linkages to facilitate demand-driven research and increased use of improved
technologies continue to constrain efforts to increase agricultural productivity as farmers
continue to use out-dated and ineffective technologies. The role of research will be
reoriented to support innovations that facilitate the transition to climate-smart agriculture
by smallholder farmers. New and emerging agricultural research partnerships will
identify technological advances that respond to the impacts of climate change and climate
variability. A major thrust will be use of climate-smart agricultural practices, promoting
improved land management and sustainable crop-livestock and fisheries intensification
and integration, in order to bolster farmers’ adaptive capacity and support the national
vision of achieving food security.

Result Areas 5: Improving and sustaining agricultural Advisory Services - Agro-
advisory services that include climate applications for agriculture will help farmers to
make informed decisions in the face of risks and uncertainties, in addition to the
integrated management of present and emerging pests and disease challenges. Climate
applications include seasonal weather forecasts, monitoring and early warning products
for drought, floods and pests and disease surveillance. These products and services will
increase the preparedness of the farmers, well in advance, to cope with risks and
uncertainties. In this regard, dissemination of agro-weather advisories and other climate-
smart agricultural practices will be enhanced through Public Private Partnerships.
Furthermore, robust agro-advisory services will catalyse private sector investment in
priority areas such as weather-based index insurance and associated infrastructure.

Result Area 6: Improved Institutional Coordination - Improved institutional
coordination is crucial for achievement of horizontal and vertical integration required for
effective discharge of the CSA Programme. The achievement of horizontal integration
requires a framework that provides high-level guidance while vertical integration is
instrumental in determining the roles of various sector institutions and devolved
governments in performing CSA mandates. The proposed coordination framework will
improve Inter-Ministerial and local Government coordination; enhance partnerships with
private sector and civil society organizations; and strengthen coordination with
development partners.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
One of the expected outcomes of national CSA Programme is the establishment of
national and local partnerships that operate across sectors and leading to the adoption and
institutionalization of CSA approaches. The delivery mechanism for  CSA
implementation is expected to facilitate the realization of local and global linkages by
targeting mostly small scale farming activities..  CSA interventions (Table 18) within the
framework of rationalized land use planning, community participation, coalition building
at local and national levels and integrated ecosystem/ watershed approach are expected to
contribute towards realization of local and global environmental benefits

Implementation of the  programme will take place through existing structures. The need
for an all-inclusive and integrated implementation approach that takes into account
synergies and partnerships between various players in dealing with challenges of climate
change is well articulated and needs to be understood by stakeholders.   Due to its multi-
sector nature, the CSA programme  will involve many stakeholders at the various levels.
Consequently it is vital to establish a well-structured and coordinated implementation
arrangement that will bring together all the actors.

The implementing institutions will be in five main categories:
 NGOs, CSOs, CBOs
 Private sector organizations
 Local governments
 Parastatals
 Government institutions

MONITORING AND EVALU ATION
The program will be monitored through the following M&E activities.

(i)
Monitoring of activities will be based on the CSA Results Based Logframe
(Table 16) and the Results Monitoring  Framework (Table 17). Two Results
Monitoring Frameworks will be developed – one for the first five years and
the second one to be developed after the mid-term review.

(ii)
Program start: A Program Inception Workshop will be held within the first 2
months of Program start. The Inception Workshop is crucial to building
ownership for the Program results and to plan the first year annual work plan.

The Inception Workshop should address a number of key issues including:
 Assist all partners to fully understand and take ownership of the Program. Detail the
roles, support services and complementary responsibilities of all stakeholders.
Discuss the roles, functions, and responsibilities within the Program's decision-
making structures, including reporting and communication lines, and conflict
resolution mechanisms. The Terms of Reference for Program staff will be discussed
again as needed.
 Review the Program Results Framework and agree on the indicators, targets and their
means of verification, and recheck assumptions and risks.
 Provide a detailed overview of reporting, monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
requirements. The Monitoring and Evaluation work plan and budget should be agreed
and scheduled.
 Discuss financial reporting procedures and obligations, and arrangements for annual
audit.
 Plan and schedule PB meetings. Roles and responsibilities of all Program
organisation structures should be clarified and meetings planned. The first PB
meeting should be held within the first 12 months following the inception workshop.

An Inception Workshop report is a key reference document and must be prepared and
shared with participants to formalize various agreements and plans decided during the
meeting.

Quarterly:
 Progress made shall be monitored using a Results Based Management Platform.
 Based on the initial risk analysis submitted, the risk log shall be regularly updated.
 Based on the information recorded, Program Progress Reports (PPR) can be
generated in the Executive Snapshot.

Annually: Annual Program Review/Program Implementation Reports (APR/PIR): This
key report is prepared to monitor progress made since Program start and in particular for
the previous reporting period (30 June to 1 July).

Uganda Climate Smart Agriculture Program 2015 - 2025

50

The APR/PIR includes, but is not limited to, reporting on the following:
 Progress made toward Program objective and Program outcomes - each with
indicators, baseline data and end-of-Program targets (cumulative)
 Program outputs delivered per Program outcome (annual).
 Lesson learned/good practice.
 AWP and other expenditure reports
 Risk and adaptive management

Periodic Monitoring through site visits: stakeholders will conduct visits to Program sites
based on the agreed schedule in the Program's Inception Report/Annual Work Plan to
assess first hand Program progress. Other members of the Program Board may also join
these visits. A Field Visit Report will be prepared and will be circulated no less than one
month after the visit to the Program team and Program Board members.

Mid-term of Program cycle: The Program will undergo an independent Mid-Term
Review at the mid-point of Program implementation. The Mid-Term Review will
determine progress being made toward the achievement of outcomes and will identify
course correction if needed. It will focus on the effectiveness, efficiency and timeliness of
Program implementation; will highlight issues requiring decisions and actions; and will
present initial lessons learned about Program design, implementation and management.
Findings of this review will be incorporated as recommendations for enhanced
implementation during the final half of the Program’s term. The organization, terms of
reference and timing of the mid-term review will be decided after consultation between
the parties to the Program document. The Terms of Reference for this Mid-term review
will be prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries based on
guidance from the COMESA Coordinating Unit.

End of Program: An independent Terminal Evaluation will take place three months
prior to the final PB meeting and will be undertaken in accordance with COMESA
guidance. The terminal evaluation will focus on the delivery of the Program’s results as
initially planned (and as corrected after the mid-term review, if any such correction took
place). The terminal evaluation will look at impact and sustainability of results, including
the contribution to capacity development and the achievement of global environmental
benefits/goals. The Terms of Reference for this evaluation will be prepared by MAAIF
based on guidance from the COMESA Coordinating Unit.

Learning and knowledge sharing: Results from the Program will be disseminated
within and beyond the Program intervention zone through existing information sharing
networks and forums.
The Program will identify and participate, as relevant and appropriate, in scientific,
policy-based and/or any other networks, which may be of benefit to Program
implementation though lessons learned. The Program will identify, analyse, and share

Uganda Climate Smart Agriculture Program 2015 - 2025

51

lessons learned that might be beneficial in the design and implementation of similar
future Programs.

There will be a two-way flow of information between this Program and other Programs
of a similar focus.

 Construction of SWC structures [contour bunds, channels, live/ grass contour bunds in low
lying areas or foot slopes, terraces]
 Conservation agriculture [minimum soil disturbance, cover crops, mulching, judicious crop
rotations, basins etc ]

II. Practices to restore and maintain soil fertility
 INM
 Adapted leguminous cover crops for improved fallows [biological nitrogen fixation]
 Compost making and application
 Agro-forestry

III. Water for production & domestic use
 Water harvesting structures/ valley tanks and dams; ferro cement tanks
 Small scale irrigation
 Run-off harvesting
IV. Practices to increase forest cover [afforestation; reforestation] or reduce pressure on
forests
 Biomass management (Agro-forestry & afforestation; reforestation)
 Energy saving stoves[house hold and institutional]
 Efficient kilns for charcoal production
 Gasification
 Woodlots

 High value crops e.g. fruits & vegetables, apples  for the highlands
 SLM friendly products Gum Arabic,  Aloe Vera, shea nut butter, etc

VI. Green House Gas Mitigation Practices (Source: MAAIF GHG Mitigation Plan)

Promote Use of tubular polyethylene bio-digesters and urea-molasses mineral block as nutrient
supplement in animal production to reduce methane emission from enteric fermentation
Upgrading of feed storage and distribution systems
Promote suitable rangeland and pasture management practices (irrigation, manuring, fertilizer application,
and grazing management)
Promote use of improved fallows such as Crotolariagrahamiana, Calliandracalothyrsus, CajanusCajan,
Sennasiamea, Sesbaniasesban and Tephrosiavogelii,

Enact and enforce Ordinances, by-laws and codes of practice on savannah/bush burning

Restore wetlands

