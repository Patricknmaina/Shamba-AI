Highlights
Kenya County Climate
Risk Profile Series
Agriculture is an important sector in Nyeri County. It employs approximately 66% of the labour force and
contributes about 57% to household incomes (GoK, 2013).
Productivity in the sector is low, as it faces several challenges such as poor agricultural credit
access, land degradation, poor access to agricultural inputs, crop livestock diseases and most
importantly climate hazards. Problematic climatic challenges in the county are drought, extreme
temperatures, frost and floods.
Kieni East and West are the most prone to floods; Kieni West, East Mukurweini, Mathira
West and Tetu Sub-county to drought and Mukurweini, Tetu, Nyeri South, Mathira East and
West sub counties more prone to landslides. These hazards affect agricultural production
negatively. For instance in 2013 resulted in a 15% decrease in crop areas in Kiamathaga
and Munyu locations, and an equal reduction in maize yields (Orre et al., 2013). Drought
incidences are foreseen to increase following a decrease in rainfall amounts after every 3-4
years (Karienye et al., 2012).
Despite the high adoption rates of adaptation strategies (72%), 74%, 68%, and 60% for
the male-, female- and youth-headed households, hitherto, the youth and female are
the most vulnerable due to factors such as limited resource (for example land) control.
These adaptations are heavily embedded in the farmers’ local knowledge which is based on
experience of their local environment and resources.
Adaptation strategies for  crop farmers include improved seed varieties, changing the cropping
calendar, use of indigenous information in controlling diseases, irrigation, water harvesting, soil and
water conservation, drought tolerant crops and use of greenhouse, use of indigenous information in
controlling diseases, irrigation, and use of greenhouses. Strategies for livestock farmers include fodder
conservation, rearing improved breeds, feed supplementation, livestock intensification (zero grazing),
and planting drought- tolerant fodder crops. There is need to promote strategies such as tree planting,
rehabilitation and conservation of water sheds and value addition for both livestock keepers and crop producers.

Nyeri County
Climate change is becoming one of the most serious
challenges to Kenya’s achievement of its development
goals as described under Vision 2030. Kenya is already
extremely susceptible to climate-related events, and
projections indicate that the impacts are likely to affect
the country even more in the future. In many areas,
extreme events and variability of weather are now the
norm: rainfall is irregular and unpredictable; some
regions experience frequent droughts during the long
rainy season, others severe floods during the short
rains. The arid and semi-arid areas are particularly
hard hit by these climate hazards, thereby putting the
lives of millions of households and their social and
economic activities at risk.
In 2010, Kenya developed a National Climate Change
Response Strategy (NCCRS) which recognized the
importance of climate change impacts on the country’s
development. This was followed by the National
Climate Change Action Plan in 2012. Since the focus
of these initiatives has been the national level, there
is a need to mainstream climate change perspectives
in programmes and development plans at the county
level.
To strengthen local capacities  to reduce the near-,
medium- and long-term vulnerability to current and
future climate variability, the Kenyan Government,
through the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock
and Fisheries (MALF) is implementing the Kenya
Adaptation to Climate Change in Arid and Semi-Arid
Lands (KACCAL) project. The project is funded with
a grant from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF)/
Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) through the
World Bank. The present study is part of the KACCAL
project; it aims to inform the county government
and stakeholders on the climate change risks and
opportunities for agriculture so that they are able to
integrate these perspectives into their development
plans and processes.
This document presents the Climate Risk Profile for
Nyeri County. The county is prone to both drought and
floods since some areas are semi-arid (those lying on
the leeward side of Mt. Kenya) and others very wet.
Rain patterns in Nyeri County have changed, with
amounts decreasing after every 3-4 years (Karienye et
al., 2012). Drought is common in the semi-arid Kieni
West, East Mukurweini, Mathira West and Tetu where
the consequences include crop failures (if crops are
still in the field), or no planting at all (if the drought
comes before farmers plant) and reduction in milk
production following a decrease in quantity and quality
of pastures. For instance the drought of 2014 that
resulted to crop failure in the constituency exposed
180,000 people (33,000households) to food insecurity
(Kenya News Agency, 2014). This saw food prices go
high especially for beans where a kilogram was selling
at 90 Kenya Shillings from 75 Shillings, a kilogram of
tomato at 60 shillings from 50, and Capsicum selling
at 100 a kilogram from 70 shillings (Business Daily,
2014), making it hard for farmers to procure supplies
for planting and consumption; necessitating food aid
interventions. The same was witnessed in 2016 when
there was a remarkable decrease in water volumes in
rivers, water pans and dams, increase in distance to
water sources, decline in milk production, increase
in food prices and increase in malnutrition cases
(NDMA, 2016). In addition to the droughts, Nyeri
County residents also suffer loss due to floods. For
example, the floods of 2015, which destroyed crops,
livestock and assets, displaced thousands in Kanyagia
location in 2015 (Star, 2015). These extreme events
compromising the livelihoods of thousands of people
in Nyeri call for deliberate efforts in building resilience
and adaptive capacity of the vulnerable.
The Profile is organized into six main sections, each
reflecting an essential analytical step in studying
current and potential adaptation options in key local
agricultural value chain commodities. The text first
offers an overview of the county’s main value chain
commodities key to food security and livelihoods,
as well as major challenges to agricultural sector
development in the county. In the next section, the main
climate hazards are identified based on the analysis of
historical climate data and climate projections. This
includes scientific assessment of climate indicators
for dry spells, flooding, and heat stress among other
key hazards for agriculture. It continues with an
analysis of the vulnerabilities and risks posed by the
hazards deemed to be potentially most harmful to the
respective value chains. Based on these vulnerabilities,
current and potential on-farm adaptation options and
off-farm serv ices are discussed. The text also provides
snapshots of the policy, institutional and governance
context that can enable adoption of resilience-building
strategies. Finally, it presents potential pathways
for strengthening institutional capacity to address
potential future climate risks.

Economic relevance of farming
Agricultural context
Nyeri is one of the 47 counties of Kenya located in
the Central region of the County. It covers about 3,337
km2]1 (KNBS, 2014) and borders Nyandarua County
to the West, Kirinyaga County to the East, Muranga
County to the South, Laikipia County to the North,
and Meru County to the North East. The county is
rich in natural resources with main features being
the Mount Kenya, the Aberdare ranges and hills like
Tumutumu, Nyeri, and Karima. The main rivers in the
county include river Chania, Sagana, Ragati and Gura
whereas the wetlands include Thuti, Kandune, Njengu,
and Kianjogu swamps. The terrain is rugged, making
exploitation of the rivers for irrigation a challenge (see
Annex 1 for a description of the administrative division
of the county).
The monthly mean temperature in the county is about
12.8-20.8oC (GoK, 2013). Rainfall is bimodal, with
the Long rains, normally 1,200 -1,600 mm, coming
between March and May and the Short rains, normally
500 -1500 mm, coming between October and
December (Ibid)2. There are year-to-year variations
of amounts of rainfall  received as well as variations
across regions within the county. Some regions for
instance in Agro-ecological Zone LH2, LH3 and LH4
receive trimodal rainfall where the middle rains come
between July and August.
The county is parceled out into 15 agro-
ecological zones (AEZs) (Jaetzold et al., 2010)
(see Annex 1):
TA0, which is under National Park (Othaya, Tetu,
and Kieni)
TAI, which is also under National Park (Mt.
Kenya; Mathira and Kieni).
UH0, also known as the Forest Zone, is under
Forest Reserve (Othaya, Tetu, Kieni, and
Mathira).
UH1, also known as the Sheep and Dairy Zone,
receives about 1080 - 2000 mm of mean annual
rainfall and lies at an altitude of 2070-2400 m
(Othaya, Tetu, Kieni and Mathira).
UH2, also known as the Pyrethrum - Wheat
Zone (though crops such as onions, cabbage,
carrot and kales are also produced in the zone),
receives about 2130-2380 mm of mean annual

rainfall and lies between 2130 and 2380 m
above sea level (Kieni).
UH3, also known as the Upper Wheat-Barley
Zone, receives 900-1050 mm of mean annual
rainfall and lies between 2130 and 2200 meters
above sea level (Kieni and a bit of Mathira).
LH1, also known as the Tea-Dairy Zone, receives
1400-1800 mm of mean annual rainfall and lies
at an altitude of 1950-2070 meters (Tetu Othaya
and Mathira).
LH2, also known as the Wheat/Maize-Pyrethrum
Zone, receives about 950-1050 mm of mean
annual rainfall and lies between 1830 and 2100
meters (Kieni, Tetu, and a small section of
Mathira).
LH3, also known as the Wheat (Maize)-Barley
Zone, receives 850-1000 mm of mean annual
rainfall and lies at an altitude of 1980-2130
meters.
LH3-4 is a transitional strip which receives about
830-930 mm of mean annual rainfall and lies
between 1900 and 2100 meters above sea level.
LH4, also called the Cattle-Sheep Barley Zone,
receives 770-820 mm of mean annual rainfall
and is 1800-1980 meters above sea level
LH5, also known as the lower Highland Ranching
Zone, receives about 650-850 mm of mean
annual rainfall and is 1890-1950 meters above
sea level (Kieni).
UM1, also known as the Coffee-Tea Zone,
receives 1100-1600 mm of mean annual rainfall
and is 1710 -1780 meters above sea level
(Othaya and Mathira).
UM2, also known as the Main Coffee Zone, about
950-1500 mm of mean annual rainfall and is
1460 -1710 meters above sea level (Mukurweini,
Mathira, Othaya, and Tetu).
UM3, also known as the Marginal Coffee Zone,
receives about 870-1000 mm of mean annual
rainfall and lies at an altitude of 1220-1780
meters.
UM4, also known as the Sunflower-Maize Zone,
receives 850-900 mm of mean annual rainfall
and is at an altitude of 150-1780 meters (Kieni
and Nyeri Town).

Nyeri County
People and livelihoods
Out of the total arable land in Nyeri, 61% (60,662 ha)
is under food crops whereas 22% (21,593 ha) is under
cash crops5 (GoK, 2014). In 2014, maize occupied
approximately 62% of land under food crops whereas
Irish potatoes occupied 7%6.
Agriculture in the county is largely dependent on rainfall
since only 16% of the potential land for irrigation has
been exploited (Kenya Open Data). Some of the factors
Nyeri County had a population of 707,003 persons,
with almost equal percentages of females and males
(51 and 49% respectively) in 2012 (GoK, 2013). A large
proportion (87%) of this population is rural given the
small number (six) of urban areas in the county (GoK,
2013). The population is projected to be 721,791 in
2017, growing at an average rate of 1.5% based on the
2009 census3 (GoK, 2014). This growth rate is relatively
smaller compared to the national rate of 2.9%, a factor
that can be attributed to the high acceptance (63%) of
birth control measures.
Nyeri County falls under the bottom ten counties with
regard to poverty indicators given that approximately

mentioned rate of 1.5.

This is the percentage of people who are unable to get nutritious and enough food due to financial constraints.

This is slightly different from what is mentioned in GoK (2013a).

The percentages were obtained from data provided in GoK (2015).
The agricultural sector is the mainstay of the economy
of Nyeri County. Agriculture comprises mainly
cultivation of cash and food crops, and rearing of
livestock and fish. It employs approximately 66%
of the labour force and contributes roughly 57% to
household incomes (GoK, 2013).  The major cash
crops grown in the county include tea, mostly grown
in Mathira, Othaya and Tetu, coffee  is mostly grown
all over the county except in Kieni, and horticultural
crops (carrots and kales) mostly in Kieni. The major
food crops grown in the county include maize, Irish
potatoes, beans, and vegetables whereas the major
livestock kept include dairy cattle, poultry, goats,
pigs, sheep and donkey. In 2012, crop produce in the
county was valued at 6,937.59 million Kenya Shillings;
the biggest portions of  - 42, 21, and 16% came from
horticulture, maize and Irish potatoes respectively
(GoK, 2014). The livestock produce in the same year
was valued at 4.76 billion Kenya Shillings, the largest
contributions coming from cow milk (74%) and beef
(15%) (Ibid).
Arable land in the county accounts for 70% (987.5
km2) of the total land area (GoK, 2013). Agricultural
production in Nyeri is mainly for subsistence purposes.
The average farm size is between 4.5 ha for small-scale
farms and 22.5 ha for large-scale farms, though the land
holding is larger in areas such as Kieni (GoK, 2014). A
majority of farmers (85%) have title deeds, a factor that
might be traced back from independence (Nyeri being
one of the white settlement areas in Kenya) as well as
the sedentary lives of the people in the county. Secure
land tenure is an incentive for farmers to invest in long-
term soil and water conservation measures.
28% of the people live under the poverty line (KNBS,
2013a).  Poverty rates are higher in the urban areas
(57%) compared to the rural areas (32%) (GoK, 2013).
This is  despite the fact that the unemployment
level stands at 21% (Ibid). Low incomes from the
economic activities undertaken in the county may be
a contributing factor to the high urban poverty level.
Nevertheless, the county is characterised by a high
quality of life given that the Human Development
Indicator (HDI) is higher than the national figure (0.58
and 0.52 respectively). The high HDI is as a result of
relatively high access to electricity considering that
approximately 26% of the households use electricity
for lighting (KNBS, 2013b), though only 1% of the
population uses electricity for cooking (GoK, 2013);
better access to health services; and relatively fewer
people (12%) with no education, making the county
rank third last with regard to people without education.
The climate vulnerability for the county is 0.245, which
is among the lowest in all the counties (GoK, 2013c).
This makes it clear that farmers’ welfare and quality of
life are instrumental factors that promote the adaptive
capacities to climate change.
Food poverty in Nyeri is estimated at 26%4. The
relatively low percentage may not necessarily mean that
the county is well off in terms of food security. There
are variations in the county with some areas such as
Kieni being more prone to food insecurity. According
to a survey by the Agricultural Sector Development
Support Programme (ASDSP), approximately 70%
of the households interviewed did not have enough
food in 2013. Female- and youth-headed households
were the most affected (GoK, 2014). The cases of
food insecurity may be attributed to fluctuations in
agricultural production due to unfavourable climatic
conditions such as frost and unreliable rainfall,
diseases such as the Maize Lethal Necrosis, and low
incomes from alternative livelihood activities.

Nyeri County
Agricultural value chain commodities in Nyeri
Agricultural value chain commodities
Nyeri County is famous for the production of an array
of agricultural commodities (value chains). Various
value chains have been prioritized for development
interventions by different government organizations
and programmes such as the Agricultural Sector
Development Support Programme (ASDSP), the Kenya
Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization
(KALRO), the University of Nairobi survey, and the Kenya
limiting full exploitation of the irrigation potential
include the rugged terrain and decline in water levels
in most of the water bodies/reservoirs. The use of
agricultural inputs in the county is relatively low with
an exception of basal fertiliser which approximately
66% of the farmers have adopted. The male-headed
households are more likely to use agricultural inputs
in both the Long and Short seasons compared to the
youth- and female- headed households (GoK, 2014).
For instance, about 31 , 6, and 3% of the farmer
households using top dress fertiliser were male-,
female-, and youth-headed respectively in 2013 (Ibid).
This factor may be attributed to the fact that men have
better access to resources such as credit and are the
custodians of the household resources. Interventions
such as Input Subsidy Programmes should therefore
be more targeted to benefit the gender and age
groups that are most disadvantaged. This may be
done through addressing contributing factors to low
input utilization like high input prices and unavailability
of certified seeds.
Agricultural Productivity Programme (KAPP). For the
development of this County Climate Risk Profile, four
major value chain commodities (VCCs) were selected
for in-depth analysis, based on their contribution
to food security, productivity characteristics, and
importance to the economy. These VCCs, validated
by local stakeholders, have been selected  from a
list compiled from the above-mentioned documents,
using the following prioritization indicators: harvested
area (hectares), production (90-kg bags where
relevant), variation in production (in the past five
years), value of production (KES/bag), dietary energy
consumption (Kcal/capita/day), protein content (g of
protein/100 g of product), iron content (mg of iron
/100 g of product), zinc content (mg of zinc/100 g of
product), and Vitamin A content (IU Vitamin A/100 g
of product). The selected value chains were dairy, Irish
potato, banana, and local poultry.
Dairy (cow)
The dairy cow is a vibrant value chain in Nyeri especially
in Nyeri South where every household has at least a
dairy cow - either local, interbreed and/or exotic breeds
(mostly Friesian, Guernsey, Jersey, and Ayrshires. The
dairy cow population in the county was estimated at
173,075 in 2014, with a production of 175,747,872
kg of milk (GoK, 2015). Dairy production in Nyeri is
mainly under zero grazing given land constraints.
Of all the total milk produced, approximately 27%
is consumed, 62% is sold, 7.7% fed to calves, and
about 3.5% lost during handling (Nassiuma and

Kenya County Climate Risks Profiles Series

Irish Potato
Local poultry (chicken)
The poultry sector ranks third in the county after dairy
and beef sectors in terms of income generation in
livestock production (GoK, 2014). The chickens are
kept for eggs as well as meat. Farmers are mostly
small scale (all over the county); every household has
at least a chicken, though production is concentrated
in Othaya. Input suppliers are mostly small scale
with a few exceptions of companies such as Kenchic,
Kuku Chick, and Brade Gate (supplying chicks) and
Maisha Millers who supply feeds. In 2014, there were
about 298,666 local poultry chicken in the county;
production in the same year was 250, 471 kg of meat
and 9,345,349 trays of eggs8 (GoK, 2015).
Productivity varies across age and gender due to
different levels of access to markets and resources
by the different groups. For instance in 2013, youth-
headed households had the highest number of eggs
sold for the indigenous chicken (2,596), whereas male-
headed households sold the most eggs for improved
indigenous chicken (103) (GoK, 2014). The high
number of eggs sold by the youth-headed households
is attributable to the likelihood of having contractual
arrangements for selling the eggs as shown in the
ASDSP survey of 2013. It also shows that the age
group is more dependent on local poultry compared
to the female-and male-headed households. Ability
to purchase and utilize commercial inputs may be a
contributing factor for the many improved indigenous
chicken eggs sold by the male-headed households.
Value addition activities undertaken in the value chain
include de-feathering, differentiation of parts, fertilizing
eggs, and boiling. The major challenges for the poultry
sector include diseases such as Newcastle, Gumboro,
fowl pox, and coccidiosis. Scarcity of chicken feeds
especially when there are no rains is a major problem
for the value chain. The alternative is for farmers to use
commercial feeds, which are sometimes unavailable
and expensive.
Irish potatoes are mainly grown in Kieni East and West,
and Mathira West and East. Production is dominated
by small- scale farmers, who grow for both household
consumption and income earning. However, more
than 60%7 of their produce is mainly for selling
(Muthoni et al., 2013);  farmers sell mostly to brokers.
Farmers use recycled planting material; the local
varieties are the most preferred due to lack of certified
seeds. In 2013, productivity was highest among the
female-headed households in the Short rain season
(3433 kg/ha) and among the male-headed households
during the Long rain season (5580 kg/ha) (see Annex
2). The higher productivity among the male-headed
households in the Long rain season was likely due to
the high input utilization (GoK, 2014).
The major challenges to the value chain is lack of
planting material and the pest Tuta Absoluta that
can cause up to 50% decline in yields. The pest is
becoming hard to control, considering that it can stay
in the soil for up to 30 years. Due to land fragmentation,
farmers are not able to practise measures such as
crop rotation. Marketing is also a challenge, more
especially in packaging. By law, potatoes are supposed
to be packed in 50-kg bags and sold at 2000 Kenya
Shillings each, but most of the time, brokers use bags
that weigh more than 100 kg hence exploiting farmers.
Nyoike, 2014). The common marketing outlets
include processors like the New Kenya Cooperative
Creameries, Brookside Wakulima Dairy and Raka,
traders and individual consumers. Approximately 37%
of the farmers sell directly to processors and about
32% sell to traders (Ibid). There exist a number of
marketing channels for milk in the county, where the
producer may sell directly to the consumer, or producer
to hawker to consumer or producer to processor to
consumer. It has been observed that the shorter the
channel the better the prices for the producers and the
consumers.
Productivity has been observed to be highest among
the female-headed households. For example, in 2013,
female-headed households had the highest productivity
in both the Long and Short rain seasons compared
to the male- and youth-headed households. THis
was despite male-headed households having better
access to livestock technologies, extension, veterinary
and Artificial Insemination (AI) services (GoK, 2014).
This may be due to the fact that women are the ones
most involved in activities such as feeding and milking,
making them more conversant with farm operations.
Some of the major challenges include diseases such
as mastitis and decline in pasture quantity and quality
especially during periods of rain scarcity. It has been
observed that feed scarcity can lead to up to 60%
reduction in milk production in the county.

Nyeri County
Banana
Bananas are mainly grown in Mukurweini Tetu, parts
of Othaya, Mathira East and West, Nyeri Central and
some parts of Nyeri South mostly on small-scale. The
common banana varieties include Gikanda, Grand-
Nain, Williams, and Ng’ombe Nusu, though local
varieties such as Gikanda are the most grown. Farmers
are starting to embrace tissue culture banana like
in Karima and Chinga locations of Othaya. Brokers
and local markets are the major output markets with
exceptions of a few groups such as Nyeri County
Banana Farmers Cooperative Society and Urumwe
Self Help Group who undertake value addition through
making banana flour and selling to a local bakery
(Kenyan Woman, 2016). Other value addition activities
for the value chain include ripening and solar drying.
Farmers rarely pay attention to their bananas so yields
are low. For example, in 2013, productivity was found to
be highest among the male-headed households (1047
kg/ha) compared to the female- and youth-headed
households (704 and 951 kg/ha respectively) (GoK,
2014). This difference in production may be associated
with the likelihood of male-headed households to use
inputs such as basal and top dressing fertilisers (which
both the female- and youth-headed households never
used), and more manure (14543 kg/ha) relative to
the quantities used by the youth and female headed
households (3347 and 440 kg/ha respectively) (Ibid).
Poor access to resources by the youth- and female-
headed households is a contributing factor to the low
input utilization. Therefore interventions in the value
chain should seek to promote input access mostly to
the youth and the adult females.
The major challenges for the value chain include high
pest (banana weevil and nematodes) and disease
(cigar end rot and fusarium wilt) incidences, lack of
certified disease-free planting material, and post-
harvest losses.
Agricultural sector challenges
In the past, Nyeri County was among the counties that
received food aid, despite its agricultural potential.
This potential has not been achieved yet due to
institutional, economic, political, geographical and
climatic challenges.
Unfavourable climatic conditions impose serious
consequences on the agricultural sector in Nyeri. This
is worsened by over-reliance on rainfall amid weather
unpredictability especially in areas such as Kieni where
droughts and floods are common. Extreme weather
events tremendously reduce the quantity and quality
of produce, factors that not only compromise food
security and income generation capacity in the area,
but also reduction in cultivated land. For example, it
has been observed that areas under potato, wheat,
sunflower, and beans have been reduced by 40, 70,
30 and 40% respectively due to unfavorable weather
(GoK, 2013). This factor is likely to increase rural urban
migration and unsustainable exploitation of natural
resources for alternative livelihoods. Inasmuch as
unfavorable weather is a problem in the county, good
weather is equally disastrous as over-supply results in
market distortions. Lack of adequate storage facilities,
given that there are only eight main storage facilities
in the entire county and lack of capacity to add value
aggravates the problem since farmers cannot store
their produce.
Population growth in the county has led to sub-division
of land into small pieces that cannot permit sustainable
rain-fed agriculture (Ekin et al., 2009 pp10). This is
more evident in the wetter areas of the county such as
Mathira, Nyeri central, some parts of Mukurweini and
Othaya where the population densities are very high
(648, 711, 470 and 501 persons/km2 respectively)
(GoK, 2013). The women and the youth are the most
affected; women in the sense that culture sidelines
them when it comes to inheritance and youth in the
sense that they have limited access to land since the
male-headed households are the ones who own title
deeds. Consequently, the youth are forced to depend
on leased land that constrains undertaking long-term
soil and water conservation investments. Agricultural
intensification through practices like irrigation is also
challenged by the rugged terrain and lack of financial
and technical capacity by most of the small scale
farmers.
Pests and diseases challenge agricultural production
in the county. The common pests include Tuta
Absoluta that attacks mainly potatoes and tomatoes.
The pest caused about 50% reduction in potato
yields in the county in 2016 (Farmers trend, 2016).
Millipedes resulted in a decline in cultivated land in
Gakawa, Naro Moru, and Kiamathaga in Kieni West
and in the lower areas of Kieni East in 2014 (NDMA,
2014). Crop diseases common in the area include
the bacterial wilt and potato blight that mainly attack
potatoes. Livestock diseases include foot and mouth
disease (FMD), East Cost Fever (ECF), Anaplasmosis
and Newcastle diseases (NCD). The diseases and
pests increase the cost of production and reduce the
quantity and quality of produce.

Past and future impacts of climate hazards in Nyeri

Nyeri County
Poor access to agricultural services such as AI, credit,
extension and inputs especially by the female- and
youth-headed households is a hindrance to high
agricultural production. According to the ASDSP
survey of 2013, male-headed households had better
access to the services, a factor that may be attributed
to better access to resources (GoK, 2014). Poor
access to credit persists in spite of the large number
of financial intermediaries in the county (Kalunda,
2014). This has been mainly attributed to lack of
financial literacy among farmers and the allegedly high
interest rates which make farmers shun seeking credit.
This therefore calls for farmer sensitization on credit.
Access to extension is expected to improve owing to
the contracted extension service delivery strategy by
the Kenya Agricultural Productivity and Agribusiness
Programme (KAPAP) that has so far benefited 10,107
farmers in the county (Ngugi et al., 2014).
Poor farmer organization also deprives farmers of
bargaining power that can facilitate efficient marketing.
As a result, farmers mostly sell individually especially
for horticultural crops such as cabbages, potato, and
kales, and hence get exploited by middlemen. Due
to the poor organization, legislations like the Potato
Production and Marketing Bill of 2014 are never
adhered to as farmers still fall victim to the extended
bags preferred by brokers. Mismanagement of most
of the cooperatives for cash crops such as coffee and
tea that leads to delayed payment has significantly
contributed to farmers uprooting the crops hence
reducing productivity. Therefore, farmers should be
encouraged to add value and to organize into groups
to facilitate access to agricultural services as well
as markets. In addition, poor road conditions in the
county that impair transport during the floods season
is also a contributing factor to poor access to the
services and markets.
Climate change and agriculture
risks and vulnerabilities
Climate variability is a reality in Nyeri that has manifested
itself in many forms as farmers reported. Remarkable
manifestations include prolonged cold seasons,
increased incidences of frost (mostly associated with
dry spells), extended rainy seasons in some areas such
as Mukurweini that result to mudslides whereas others
like Kieni experience prolonged drought, and extreme
temperatures. In the past, the cold season spanned July
to August, but now it begins in May through August.
Temperatures have become higher now especially
during dry spells unlike in the past. Rain distribution is
becoming unreliable and unpredictable. For example,
the long rains of 2013 were delayed by 2 weeks in
Kieni, and about 70% was received in April alone.
These changes are in tandem with accounts that have
been made in other forums such as the consultative
stakeholder workshop on the development of the
national climate change response strategy action plan
(GoK, 2012) and Roncoli et al. (2010).
It was agreeable among farmers that the changes have
mostly been brought about by human activities such
as clearing of the Aberdare and other forests in the
county and cutting down of indigenous trees such
as mugumo, muiri, mutundu, and muringa (which
they believe attract rainfall) for human settlement and
burning of charcoal or replacing them with exotic
trees like the eucalyptus.  The farmers are aware that
climate change has brought about a change in the
ecosystem, where some species of insects which were
not common for instance millipedes and centipedes
have in the recent past increased and others like the
safari ants disappeared. The farmers also reported that
there has been substantial loss of plant biodiversity
evident from the declining pasture land. This factor,
together with decrease in water volumes in many water
reservoirs has resulted in increased human wildlife
conflict, an example of which was reported in the
news9. It was reported that some water ways like river
Gathanji in Mahiga location, river Gichanga in Kagere
location and River Kahuro in Mwanda location have
dried up.
Farmers also associated societal problems such as
food insecurity and increased cases of domestic
violence with climate variation. This mainly arises
from the low productivity, for crops and livestock
alike which translate into low household incomes.
Incidences of human diseases such as malaria have
increased, following increasing mosquito populations
in the region. This account together with those
already mentioned agrees with scientific knowledge
that climate variation if not checked can have serious
implications on the ecosystem and human livelihoods.

Climate vulnerabilities across agriculture
value chain commodities
Dairy (cow)
Irish Potato
A number of climatic hazards are evident in Nyeri
as discussed above, the most remarkable being
drought and extremely low temperatures. The most
problematic with regard to the prioritized value chain
were identified as drought and variations in extreme
temperature/frost. These hazards affect the value
chains differently as discussed below.
Irish potato in Nyeri is mostly affected by extremely
cold temperatures (frost), and drought. The impact
of frost on input supply is minor to major, moderate
on on-farm production, major on harvesting and
storage and minor to major on output marketing.
Frost reduces the quality of planting material,
causing poor establishment when planted. As a
result, planting material becomes unavailable due
to increased demand. On-farm activities affected
include land preparation and disease control. It was
reported that land preparation and disease control
costs increase significantly during the cold season due
to harsh working conditions and an upsurge of pests
(millipedes) and diseases (bacterial wilt, early and late
blight). Consequently, farmers are required to use
more fungicides, or harvest prematurely to salvage
the crop, with the yields being below normal and of
poor quality. The prematurely harvested potatoes
are of poor quality and hence cannot be stored. Low
produce volumes increase the per unit packaging and
transporting costs.
Drought on the other hand causes a major decrease in
availability and quality of planting material at the input
supply stage. At the on-farm production stage, the
effect can be major to severe, affecting mostly land
preparation due to hardening of the soils (black cotton
soils), and pest and disease control as costs increase
due to increased disease and pest incidences. Farmers
bypass the challenge of fertiliser use normally by using
organic fertiliser and manure. Notwithstanding, these
factors compounded result to low yields and poor
quality produce; exposing the farmer to the  same
transport challenges as  during extreme cold.
Lack of certified seed potato and the capacity to add
value are some of the factors making farmers adapt
poorly to these hazards. In addition, due to land
Drought and extremely low temperatures/frost are the
most problematic hazards to the dairy cow in Nyeri
County. The consequences of drought on the dairy
cow are severe in all the value chain stages viz, input
supply, on-farm production, post-harvest handling,
and marketing. During dry spells, the quality and
quantity of major fodder crops like Napier grass, fodder
maize stalks, and in some cases oats, leaucaena, and
calliandra tremendously decrease due to scarcity of
water. This requires farmers to use alternative strategies
such as commercial feeds (supplements) and hay
which are not always affordable, considering that
feeding takes approximately 70-80% of the production
cost (Mbugua et al., 2012). Due to poor feeding, milk
yield decreases and quality deteriorates.  The cow
also gets more prone to diseases such as FMD due to
low immunity, consequently increasing costs incurred
on veterinary services. The low quantities produced
impair marketing as they increase transport costs
making farmers resolve to sell directly to consumers.
The high temperatures associated with dry spells have
also been associated with interruption of the oestrus
cycle of cows, hence reducing fertility.
Extremely low temperatures/frost on the other hand
also affect input supply severely, whereas the impact on
on-farm production and post-harvest losses is minor to
severe, and moderate to severe at the marketing stage.
Extremely low temperatures/frost, also lead to poor
performance of fodder crops. For instance in 2013,
frost damaged 60% of Napier in Kieni East, leading to
feed scarcity. Disease and pest proliferation was also
reported to be common during periods of extremely
low temperatures/frost. Cold temperatures also reduce
milk production since the cow utilizes more energy in
regulation of body temperature instead of producing
milk hampering marketing, and increasing transport
costs.
Low resource base for instance land is a major factor
that is making farmers poorly adapt to the hazards.
For example, farmers are not able to undertake
fodder conservation due to lack of capital which also
makes farmers lack the capacity to comply with the
requirements for having a certificate as milk vendors.
This factor, coupled with poor farmer organization,
limits marketing options. In addition, the poor road
network in the county and lack of coolers are factors
that impair value addition for milk in Nyeri.

10	 It has been observed that refrigerated eggs have a longer shelf life of 30-45 days compared to the 7-10 days for those stored at room temperature. http://articles.mercola.com/
sites/articles/archive/2013/12/07/refrigerating-chicken-eggs.aspx
Local chicken (Poultry)
Banana
The effect of drought on local chicken is moderate to
severe at the input supply stage. The most affected
activities at this stage are seeking veterinary services
and procurement of chicks. The cost incurred for
the veterinary services significantly increase due to
more demand created by high disease incidences
(Newcastle disease) and deterioration in quality of
the vaccines. Mortality rate of chicks purchased from
distant hatcheries normally increase during drought, a
factor that may be associated with high temperatures
common during dry spells. Severity on on-farm
production, mostly feeding, is moderate. Dry spells
normally result in scarcity of feeds, hence reduced
feeding and low egg production. Consequently,
farmers are required to use commercial feeds which
increase the cost of production remarkably. High
temperatures associated with drought also lead to a
moderate reduction in the shelf-life of eggs and meat10,
a problem that is aggravated by the lack of storage
facilities in the county. Effect at the output market is
severe to major, mostly during selling. Farmers lack
bargaining power due to the low production as they
have to sell to individual consumers in the local markets
with an exception of a few cases where farmers sell the
eggs collectively.
Extremely low temperatures (frost)  inflict the same
consequences as drought on the value chain with a
moderate to severe effect at the input supply stage,
a moderate to severe effect on on-farm production, a
moderate to major effect on harvesting and storage,
and a major to severe effect on marketing. In addition
to resulting in feed scarcity at the farms, extremely
cold temperature increases chick mortality rates. This
is mostly common among farmers who cannot afford
equipment such as incubators. Low production during
extreme temperatures also impairs marketing as
farmers lack bargaining power. The same adaptation
strategies used during drought are also used during
periods of extremely low temperatures. Lack of capital
to enable farmers purchase equipment like incubators,
little know-how on good husbandry methods, and lack
of storage facilities are some of the major hindrances
to farmers’ ability to adequately adapt to the hazards.
The banana plant is known to be very sensitive to
changes in the environment (Turner et al., 2007).
Drought and extremely low temperature/frost are
the most problematic hazards to the crop in Nyeri
County. Drought severely affects the banana at input
supply, on-farm production, post-harvest handling and
marketing stages. At the input supply stage, the most
affected activity is acquisition of planting material as
drought reduces the quality of the seedlings. Poor
establishment of the seedlings when planted requires
farmers to purchase more planting material hence
more costs. Due to the hard nature of the soil during dry
spells, banana root establishment is greatly impaired.
This factor coupled with scarcity of water in the banana
pseudo-stem results in collapsing of the stems.
Drought has also been associated with weight loss
during transportation, especially when the bananas are
transported over long distances, a situation worsened
by lack of specialized transportation trucks. The low
productivity and poor quality associated with these
consequences pose marketing challenges; transport
costs increase owing to the low volumes and farmers
receive lower prices due to poor quality. Some of the
adaptation options used by farmers include using
certified planting material, water harvesting and small
scale irrigation, establishment of collection centres,
and group formation to facilitate value addition like
making banana flour.
The magnitude of the impact of extremely low
temperatures/frost on the input stage is minor, minor
to severe on the on-farm stage and severe on both
the post-harvest and product marketing stages.
Extremely low temperatures influence input prices,
especially those of planting material. This arises from
high demand for the input as a result of poor on-farm
establishment. In addition, manure quality is likely to be
low when temperatures are extremely low. This may be
attributed to the poor quality of feed that animals feed
on when temperatures are extremely low. As a result,
banana productivity declines, considering that farmers
mainly depend on manure for soil replenishment for
banana. Storage of banana is also a challenge since it
is highly sensitive to temperature; higher temperatures
result in quick ripening and low temperatures cause
rotting. Farmers therefore have to sell to local markets
either as whole bunches or banana hands;  the latter
increases profit margins.
fragmenttion in the county, farmers are unable to
adopt measures such as crop rotation in disease and
pest control.

In general, farmers’ capacity to cope with and
adapt to these changing conditions in climate has
been impaired by the wider social, institutional and
geographical context they live in. Due to human
and livestock population growth, pressure on natural
resources has increased.  This, coupled with the loss of
land and water resources to other livelihood activities,
has impaired their traditional ways of coping with
drought, floods and frost. For livestock farmers these
include fodder conservation, rearing improved breeds,
feed supplementation, livestock intensification (zero
grazing) and planting drought-tolerant fodder crops.
For crop farmers these include improved seed varieties,
changing the cropping calendar, use of indigenous
information in controlling diseases, irrigation, and use
of greenhouses. Strategies such as water harvesting
and value addition are undertaken by both crop and
livestock farmers. Production for subsistence by most
of the small-scale farmers reduces their accessibility to
credit since most financial institutions are more skewed
towards cash crops in addition to requiring collateral.
Adaptive measures such as irrigation are impaired by
the rugged terrain. Poor investments in  infrastructure,
including road networks and poor maintenance of for
instance milk coolers is obstructing their opportunity to
access markets and add value to their products which
would allow them to receive better prices and improve
incomes. Poor farmer organization limits collective
production and marketing as a strategy for reducing
transport costs and increasing bargaining power. Lack
of access to inputs such as planting material and
adulteration of others like fertilisers also erode farmers’
adaptive capacity.
In spite of these challenges, Nyeri County is among
the counties with the highest adaptation of strategies
such as water harvesting (Syomiti, 2015). Results
from the ASDSP survey of 2013 showed that at least
72% of the farmers have adopted several on-farm
and off-farm adaptation strategies. At least 74% of
male-headed households, 68% of female- and 60% of
youth-headed households have some adaptation to
climate change (Annex 4) (GoK, 2014). Male-headed
households are more likely to apply climate change
adaptation strategies on their farms. This is because
they have higher access to productive resources such
as land, extension and training. Adult males also
have more decision-making power on household
resource utilization compared to women and youth.
Some adaptations are specific to certain value chains
whereas others cut across value chains.
Increasing scale of climate impacts presents to farmers
the urgency to address climate change adaptation
more coherently. Barriers to effective adaptation such
as poor marketing systems, high cost of production,
weak linkages between participating stakeholders to
support advocacy, poor policy and coordination, limited
or no access to credit facilities, low scale investment
in technology, inequitable linkages between selected
value chain actors and poor dissemination of climate-
related information have impaired farmers’ capacity to
effectively cope with the changing climatic conditions.
These negative outcomes have instigated the use of
adaptation strategies such as early planting, using
tolerant varieties, and applying indigenous knowledge
on disease and pest control
In spite of these barriers, both livestock and crop
producers have considered the use of small water
harvesting techniques to conserve water for irrigation
and consumption  during drought. For instance, two
water pans have been constructed in Kieni West and
East. Value addition in milk through activities such
as fermenting and making yoghurt and solar drying
and frying in potatoes to make crisps and chips  has
helped to increase the profits for their commodities
despite these erratic weather events. According to
the ASDSP household survey of 2013, value addition
(30.5%) was more practised as compared to soil and
water conservation (12.8%). This may be attributed to
the high perishability of the agricultural produce and
inadequacy of storage facilities. Adding value through
activities such as solar drying increases the shelf life of
these commodities, which counters the lack of proper
infrastructure to support postharvest processes.
Potato producers have adopted practices such as using
certified improved seeds and clean planting material
from research institutions (such as KALRO), use of
soil and water conservation measures and use of water
harvesting channels especially for high water-sensitive
crops such as bananas. Farmers have adjusted their
cropping systems through alteration of inputs such as
use of varieties/species that have increased tolerance
or resistance to low and high temperatures, alteration
of fertiliser rates to reduce wastage or to maintain
the fruit, grain or tuber quality, timing of planting and
harvesting dates and sometimes even changing the
cropping locations to escape the adverse effects of
these climatic hazards.  Control of pests and diseases
is done through use of the so much valued indigenous
knowledge or by use of pesticides and fungicides.
Farmers also undertake sustainable land management
practices to reduce the negative impacts through

diversification e.g. crop rotation, intercropping,
mulching, and terracing.
Adaptation strategies within the livestock and poultry
sub-sectors vary depending on the climatic hazards.
However, certain strategies such as modification of
feeding times, matching the stocking density to the
amount of feeds available, supplementation using
minerals and reducing the stocking density through
culling are widely used between these two sub
sectors. For extremely low temperatures (frost) in
poultry production, farmers have had to reconsider
the chicken housing and install heating equipment or
use saw dust to reduce the negative effects of the low
temperatures on the productivity. These investments
increase production costs. In response to these
adverse effects, local poultry farmers keep cross-
breeds that are tolerant to diseases, use conventional
treatment such as aloe vera for disease control, and
feed the chicken on left-overs.
At the product marketing level across all value chains,
farmers with financial capacity add value to their
produce which in turn translates to higher profit
margins. To cushion the high costs of transportation
and marketing costs they sell their produce collectively
through farmer groups and in smaller quantities to
increase the prices so as to fetch better income.
There is substantial room for improvement in the
capacity to assess, plan for and manage climate-
related incidents so as to ensure that farmers are better
prepared for any future climatic hazards. This will help
improve access to inputs as well as planning and
scheduling of on-farm production activities. Effective
marketing of agricultural products is dependent on
the creation of a conducive environment. Services
such as development of aggregation centres as well
as collection points at the ward level can facilitate
market access. Interaction between the value chain
actors to reach regional and national markets should
be promoted.
Off-farm adaptation practices
Off farm services such as Early Warning Systems
(EWS) provided by NDMA and supported by KMD
help to improve farmer preparedness through monthly
bulletins and seasonal forecasts. Participatory Scenario
Planning (PSP) facilitated by ASDSP enhances farmer
knowledge on future climatic events and allows them
to engage with the experts in selection of intervention.
Farmer extension programmes, vaccination services,
Artificial Insemination (AI), storage facilities, market
information systems, credit and financing, climate-
related information, are offered to farmers to increase
their adaptive capacity in the reality of increased
unpredictability of climate. These services are offered
by the county government, private organizations, and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
According to the ASDSP survey 2013, about 50% of
the households accessed agriculture-related services
from the public and private sector institutions. Over 50
% of the households in the county were satisfied with
the major agriculture-related services with respect to
research, veterinary, Artificial Insemination, and other
services (GoK, 2014).  However, the crop and livestock
productivity was low  despite these high satisfaction
levels from the respondents, an indication that the
actual adoption of services offered is quite low.
In terms of postharvest services, the most common
practices exist within the households and farming
communities. These practices rely on the farmers’
knowledge which is not efficient and has often led to
major postharvest losses due to the use of inadequate
storage facilities.
Market information systems and savings were the most
common financial services used by the respondents
with at least 53 and 40% of the households accessing
each respectively. Disaggregated by gender, at
least 55% of adult male-headed households and
45% of adult female-headed households accessed
market information services. At least 60% of youth-
headed households accessed savings compared to
approximately 40% of adult male- and female-headed
households.
Insurance services in Nyeri county remain limited. Only
11% of adult female-headed households accessed
insurance services compared to approximately 23%
of adult male- and youth-headed households. This
being a developmental challenge, it decreases the
farmers’ financial resilience to adapt to climate shocks
in the future. Agricultural credit was shown to be the
least-accessed financial service with only about 10%
of youth-headed households and 15% of adult male-
headed households accessing it. Less than 2% of
the female-headed households interviewed indicated
having accessed agricultural credit (Figure 1).  This
may be attributed to lack of available agricultural
credit services or a rigorous process of applying for the
services, or farmers have found it safer and cheaper
to get the same services from their cooperatives and
groups.

Policies are key considerations for agriculture decision-
making, since they affect actions and outcomes related
to resource use. Several programmes aimed at broadly
addressing the topics related to climate vulnerabilities
have been put in place through the collaboration of local,
national, international, governmental, nongovernmental,
private and faith-based organizations and the community
at large. Some of the major programmes in Nyeri County
include
The Agricultural Sector Development Support Programme
(ASDSP) started in 2013, running through 2016. It was
funded by the Government of Kenya and the Swedish
government. Its objective was to transform Kenya’s
agriculture into an innovative, commercial-oriented, modern
industry to alleviate poverty and improve food security. The
programme also focuses on environmental resilience and
social inclusion. In Nyeri County, the ASDSP is involved
in the facilitation and coordination of the Participatory
Scenario Planning with key stakeholders with support from
CARE International, Kenya. The ASDSP also works with
key value chain actors, including cooperatives and county
departments, towards developing and strengthening value-
added practices in the indigenous poultry, Irish potato and
dairy cow value chains.
The Upper Tana Natural Resource Management Project
began in 2012 and is expected to run until 202011. This
project is funded by the Government of Kenya, the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),
the Spanish Trust Fund and the local community. The
ultimate goal of the project is to contribute to the reduction
of rural poverty through community empowerment in
the Upper Tana River catchment, increase sustainable
food production and incomes, and promote sustainable
management of natural resources.
Caritas Nyeri is the development arm of the Archdiocese
of Nyeri County. Its main aim is to promote all aspects of
human development12. The target population includes the
poor communities in the marginal parts of Laikipia and
Nyeri Counties. While Caritas Nyeri operates in the entire
Diocese of Nyeri, most of the programmes and activities
are concentrated in the semi-arid agro ecological zones of
Kieni. Some of these projects/programmes include:
The Rural Water Programme that aims at improving
the general living conditions such as health and hygiene
status for both the human and livestock populations in the
predominantly semi-arid areas of Kieni. The programme
started in 2012 and ended in 2014, and has benefited
4,700 people in terms of reduced water-borne diseases
and consistent water supply.
The Keurig-Smallholder Coffee Livelihoods Diversification
Project started in 2010 and was funded by Keurig Inc13
Its goal is to improve the livelihoods of the vulnerable
smallholder coffee farmers mainly by improving  their credit
access in Muhito, Githi, Rutune, Giathugu, Gakindu, Thanu,
and Gikondi of Nyeri County. The project directly and
indirectly benefited 1,500 and 18,000 farmers respectively.
The Climate Change Adaptation Project is a partnership
between Fastenopfer and Caritas Nyeri. It aims to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions through promotion of energy-
efficient and affordable cooking stoves. The project targets
to supply 15,000 stoves in 7 years in the entire Nyeri and
neighbouring Laikipia County. The Community Economic
Empowerment Programme (CEEP) is solely implemented
by Caritas Nyeri to improve the economic status  of about
20% of the most vulnerable annually. Started in 2012, the
project aims to improve livelihoods of 50,000 vulnerable
households in Nyeri by 2017.
In addition to the above-mentioned programmes, the Fish
Farming Enterprise Productivity Programme (FFEPP) of
the Economic Stimulus Programme (ESP) and Economic
Recovery, Poverty Alleviation and Regional Development
Programme (ERPARDP) provides extension services,
constructs fish ponds, and provides inputs to farmers such
as fish feed and fingerlings to enhance commercialization
of aquaculture.
Another programme is the Njaa Marufuku Kenya
Programme (NMKP) whose main aim is to promote
initiatives that improve food security, nutrition, and the
livelihoods of 120 vulnerable farmer groups through
provision of grants and capacity building.
The Small Holder Horticulture Empowerment Unit Project
(SHEP-UP) targeted Kieni East and Kieni West areas.
Eighteen farmer groups were trained and retrained on
gender mainstreaming, cropping calendar, record keeping,
soil fertility technologies, and marketing. The Kenya

Nyeri County
Governance, institutional
resources, and capacity
There are a number of governmental, non-governmental,
private, and faith-based organizations working in Nyeri
County to address climate change-related challenges. The
government institutions doing interventions in the livestock
subsector  include the Kenya Dairy Board (KDB), which
provides new technologies and regulates the processing
and marketing of milk; processing and value addition
companies such as Kenya Cooperative Creameries (KCC)
and the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) that provide
ready markets  for farmers and promote productivity
and competitiveness of the sector. The Central Artificial
Insemination Station (CAIS) provides AI services and builds
the capacity of  farmers on breeding methods, whereas
the Kenya Veterinary Association (KVA) undertakes mass
vaccinations for disease control.
The government institutions involved in the crop sub-sector
include the Kenya Agricultural Research and Livestock
Organization (KALRO) that undertakes agricultural
research and dissemination of technologies to farmers and
a number of higher-learning institutions such as the Jomo
Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT)
that research and provide   banana tissue culture planting
material to farmers. Other supporting institutions include
the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA,)
which is in charge of drought management in semi-arid
regions of the county (Kieni) through interventions like early
warning advisories; the Kenya Forest Research Institute
(KEFRI) that promotes conservation of forests through
conservation of forest genetic resources and protection
of water catchment areas; and the National Environment
Management Authority (NEMA) that promotes sustainable
environmental management through supervision and
coordination of environment-related matters. Lastly,
the Kenya National Federation of Farmers (KENAFF) is
mainly mandated to train farmers on soil conservation and
management and tree planting; and the Kenya Livestock
Producers Association (KLPA) which promotes good
livestock husbandry and production.
The Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working
towards strengthening the resilience of smallholder
farmers to climate change include Farm Concern, African
Conservation Tillage Network, CARITAS, which is involved
in farmer training in climate mitigation strategies, Plant
Wise, and International Centre of Insect Physiology and
Ecology  (ICIPE), which is researching on pest and disease
control in production of crops such as potatoes. In spite of
the presence of non-governmental organizations, there is
no much influence of donors or organizations which could
reduce crop losses through disease and pest control. the
project is on-going.
Project on enhancing gender responsive services in Kenya
(PEGRESS) was funded by both the Government of Kenya
and JICA (Japanese International Cooperation Agency). Its
main goal is to improve livelihoods of smallholder female
and male farmers’ pastoralists and fisher folk. This is after
recognizing gender mainstreaming as key in agriculture
sector development. The initiative is to ensure that gender
issues are integrated into policies and development
programs. The project is in Mathira Constituency.
East Africa Agricultural Productivity Project (EAAPP) is
a World Bank funded, regional research development
initiative. It covers Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia.
Enterprises of interest are Dairy, Cassava, Rice and wheat.
Its objectives are specialization in agricultural research,
collaboration in agricultural training, Technology transfer,
facilitate increased transfer of agricultural technology and
information and knowledge across national boundaries. In
Kenya the focus is on dairy and wheat in Mathira and Kieni
Constituency
The policies that are implemented and adopted in Nyeri
County include:
The Environmental Management and Coordination Act
(EMCA) of 1999 was amended in 2015 and includes climate
change considerations. It guides ministries to consider
climate change mitigation measures in the actions and
budgets, requesting the establishment of environmental
departments or designated officers in each county.
Nyeri County Agriculture Development Act 2016 seeks
to establish an efficient legal and institutional framework
for development in agriculture through regulation and
monitoring value addition and authorizing and inspecting
books with regard to distribution and/or sale of agricultural
produce. The benefits of the bill are yet to be realised
considering the challenges experienced in the county in
marketing of produce such as milk and potatoes. The same
case applies to the Potato Production and Marketing Bill of
2014 that was formulated to guide potato marketing with
regards to packaging. The bill stipulates that packaging
should be done in 90-kg bags, a rule that is rarely followed
as brokers use bags that can weigh up to more than 100
kg. The Bill if well implemented can help farmers maximize
returns from potato production.
The county also implements the National Animal Disease
Act CAP.364 of 1989 (revised in 2012). The statute, which

These institutions are curtailed in delivering the interventions
due to constraints in human and financial capacity. There
is evidence of poor coordination within and without these
organizations, a contributing factor to the ineffective delivery
of services and other agriculture-related information.
Synthesis and Outlook
Nyeri County has been depicted to be well off relative to
other counties considering, the low poverty levels, the
high literacy, better access to health services, high HDI
and a low climate change vulnerability index. However,
the future of the agricultural sector is blink following the
adverse impact of climatic hazards. The low climate
vulnerability index doesn’t necessarily mean that the county
is well cushioned against the negative impacts of climate
variation, considering the high inequality in the county.
Fifty-two percent of the land area is semi-arid (Kieni);
floods, frost, and droughts have compromised the food
security and livelihoods of thousands; and there is a high
likelihood of climatic conditions being more unfriendly in
the future as seen from climate data simulations. These
factors compounded make climate variation an important
subject in the county.
Adoption of adaptation strategies to climate change such
as water harvesting techniques, soil and water conservation,
and value addition has been shown to be relatively high in
Nyeri County. However, they are not adequate in addressing
the climate shocks. This may be attributed to several factors
such as the low utilization of off farm services like extension,
credit, and  insurance; land fragmentation; poor road
infrastructure; and farmers being more aligned to short-
term rather than long-term interventions thus  increasing
their susceptibility to the climate shocks. The indigenous
knowledge system  should enable farmers  to withstand
these climate-related shocks, risks, and other stresses.
However, these are not adequate due to the vulnerability of
agriculture to recurring climatic hazards. This predisposes
them to food insecurity and exacerbated levels of poverty,
which weaken their coping strategies. There is the need
to integrate indigenous knowledge systems and scientific
knowledge to increase acceptability of adaptation
interventions
Existing programmes and projects aligned to support of
increasing resilience complement and are in harmony with
existing frameworks, policies and initiatives in the county.
They therefore reinforce climate intervention activities and
build the farmers’ adaptive capacity to cope with stresses
and shocks. These programmes are jointly coordinated
and managed by the county government in collaboration
with the implementers to ensure shared accountability
and sustainability of the progress. However, there is a
disconnect between the policies and programmes. For
instance, the Nyeri Climate Change Policy Framework
could be a platform to improve effective response to climate
change adaptation and mitigation as it supports integration
of climate change adaptation  into the county economic
and development policies. The level of its adoption and
implementation is unclear and undefined. The same case
applies to other legislations such as the Potato Marketing
Bill which is rarely adhered to. In addition, collaboration with
the key stakeholders in charge of climate risk management
is limited.
