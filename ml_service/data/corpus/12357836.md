INTRODUCTION
Background
The demand for rice has increased rapidly in Africa since the latter half of the 1990s, and its increasing
dependence on imported rice has become evident. The rise in global grain prices between 2007 and
2008 accentuated the problem of food insecurity for many, in particular poverty-stricken households in
Africa. The threatening situation called for emergency measures including medium-to long-term
production expansion. Rice can be considered possibly the only major grain consumed in Africa with
an extensive potential for expansion on the continent. Coherent national policies and international
support in this sector will not only contribute to resolving some of the major food insecurity threats
faced on a medium and long term basis, but also to alleviate poverty in general and promote rural
development.
On this note, JICA and the "Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA)" jointly announced the
establishment of the "Coalition for African Rice Development (CARD)" on the occasion of TICAD IV held
in Yokohama in May 2008. This comprehensive initiative comprises of a consultative group of donors,
research institutions and other relevant organizations to support national efforts to expand rice
production in Africa.
Various cooperation projects were financed by JICA to promote rice cultivation within the CARD
framework. Technical cooperation in rice cultivation, focused in particular, on assistance and training
provided to ministerial agents and farmers in the CARD member countries. The impact assessments of
these projects clearly show the effectiveness of this cooperation; the target of increasing the total
annual production from 14 million tons to 28 million tons from 2008-2018 was achieved, thereby
"Doubling rice production in 10 years"2.
Useful technical rice cultivation solutions were identified in each target country during each project
implementation. A technical handbook and project assessment review were also prepared and shared
for every project. It would thus be important to extract the lessons learned from these projects and to
evaluate the most effective technical solutions that contributed to the achievement of the CARD
objectives.
The second phase of CARD starting from 2019, aims to double rice production from 28 million tons
to 56 million tons over a period of 12 years ending in 2030. JICA will continue to provide the necessary
technical assistance during the given period. An assessment of the useful technical solutions applied
during the first phase of CARD would further improve the quality of technical cooperation.
This document is the result of a comprehensive analysis of all the handbooks and related project
reports (first phase of CARD) including sector reviews from advisory experts. The effective technical
solutions (including policy and strategic approach) are also extracted from the analysis of the project
output and compiled in the document. This technical manual, officially known as “JICA Technical Manual

for Rice Cultivation in Africa: CARD Implementation 2008-2018” is thus the fruit of the compilation of
the above-mentioned-information. This manual would be a useful tool for the formulation of future rice
cultivation projects and technical assistance in Sub-Saharan Africa. The manual exists in four versions,
French and Portuguese, Japanese and English to facilitate comprehension and communication by all
involved in rice cultivation on the continent.
JICA and CARD
JICA, as one of the Steering Agencies of CARD, works with 10 international organizations and research
institutes 3  to assist the 23 African CARD member countries 4  to formulate their National Rice
Development Strategy (NRDS). JICA has also played an active role in supporting these countries in their
efforts to increase rice production in line with their strategies. A total of 218 rice projects amounting to
a global sum of 9 billion US$, were implemented by governing bodies and state authorities (of which,
48 financed by JICA) to double total production in 2018.
In the first phase of CARD (2008 – 2018),
the approach deployed to achieve the
targeted
goal
was
namely
via
the
development of:  value chain, agro-ecology,
human
resources
and
South-South
cooperation (right Fig).
Many JICA projects sought to develop
agro-ecology in Africa within three farming
environments: "irrigated paddy fields", "rain-
fed lowland paddy fields", and "upland fields".
These
projects
include
selecting
the
appropriate varieties and introducing necessary cultivation techniques as well as inputs (water, fertilizer,
etc.) for each environment Others involve the rehabilitation of irrigation facilities to improve water
regulation of paddy fields and capacity development of water users associations. Assistance also
extended to rain-fed lowland paddy fields with the establishment and dissemination of rice cultivation
development models and to upland farming with the dissemination of NERICA rice.

INTRODUCTION
I-3
The second phase of CARD was launched in
2019. JICA pledges to continue its technical
assistance for the next 12 years to help further
double rice production from 28 million to 56
million tons in 2030.
In this phase, the emphasis will not only be
made on the expansion of production volume
and cultivation area. The "RICE approach" will
be adopted to focus on the distribution and
the business of producing “high quality
marketable rice” with the support of regional
communities (RECs) as shown in right Fig. In
short, the valuable technical solutions identified
during the first phase will be deployed to achieve the new goals based on the "RICE approach" in the
second phase.

User Guide
This manual gives an insight to a variety of useful rice cultivation techniques developed and
disseminated during the implementation of the JICA projects that contributed largely to the eventual
elaboration of rice cultivation policies and systems. The contents of this document are designed to
motivate readers to promote rice cultivation regardless of their perspectives and to examine the diverse
solutions.
This manual is intended to provide guidance to the users listed below. This document is shared
externally with all the partners involved in rice cultivation projects to allow everyone to draw on our
experiences and put them to practical use on the grounds. We hope that the good practices and
effective solutions described in this manual will be reflected in the NRDS of CARD member countries in
their elaboration of efficient domestic rice promotion policies and strategies to attain the new goals.

Organization of Chapter 1 CARD Achievement on Phase 1
-
As mentioned earlier, the goal of "Doubling rice production in 10 years (2008 – 2018)" was achieved
in first phase of CARD. This chapter summarizes the situation of the 23 Sub-Saharan member
countries at the end of Phase 1, with supporting statistical data. The 23 countries are divided into
two groups. The progress attained by each country is described and analyzed according to
production volume trends, area harvested, and annual average yield (Section 1-3 NRDS
Achievements of Target Countries).
Organization of Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
-
Chapter 2 consists of 8 parts as shown below. It may be easier for readers, unfamiliar with rice
cultivation in Sub-Saharan Africa, to begin with Section 2-1 Overview of Rice Cultivation. This will
probably facilitate understanding of the context in which specific technologies were developed and
disseminated in each field.
-
In addition to production and post-harvest technology highly emphasized by rice cultivation
policies there is a need to address the issues related to the entire rice value chain from the market
perspective in order to achieve the objectives in phase 2 Section 2-6 Rice Farming Management
and Value Chain Development, provides an insight on the issues and measures that would improve
financial accessibility and coordination flow from the upstream to the downstream of the value
chain through better farming management planning, sales, and structural reinforcement.

INTRODUCTION
I-5
-
As for the cultivation techniques adapted to different farming systems, rice farming solutions for
irrigated and rainfed paddy fields (lowland and deep-water) are described in section 2-2 Lowland
rice and for upland fields in section 2-3 Upland Rice respectively. Other issues common to the
described farming systems are mentioned for example, in section 2-2 Lowland rice with a sub-
section 2-2-3 Planting.
-
Section 2-5 Seed Production provides an insight on the role of seed production systems, seed
testing laboratories, work processes, points of concern, issues and examples of support for seed
production (different from the general rice production), based on project implementation
experiences.
-
Irrigation issues including water management in the fields are described in “Rice crop management”
explained in Section 2-2 Lowland rice and Section 2-3 Upland Rice. Section 2-7Irrigation describes
the technical aspects of a wide-area water supply and distribution system from water sources to
fields, focusing on the construction of facilities and the role of water management organizations in
facility and water maintenance as well as management respectively.
-
The issues of agricultural mechanization during cultivation and post-harvest periods are described
in section 2-2 Lowland rice, section 2-3 Upland Rice and Section 2-4 Post-harvest Processing
respectively. The development, improvement, manufacture, promotion, use, maintenance, and
safety of agricultural machinery are described in a sector-wide manner, rather than in terms of
individual operations in section 2-8 Mechanization of Rice Cultivation.

Organization of Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
-
Four major issues are dealt with in Chapter 3 (as shown below). Readers who may not have sufficient
knowledge about technology transfer and dissemination are advised to first read section 3-1
Structure of Technique Dissemination. This would provide a better understanding of the major
actors involved in dissemination and the basic dissemination methods (ToT, OJT, and FFS).
-
Issues relating to target techniques, technique transfer and dissemination methods are discussed
in two sections; section 3-2 Technique Transfer to Project Partners and section 3-3 Dissemination
to Farmers.
-
The organizations responsible for dissemination are described in section 3-2 Technique Transfer to
Project Partners while the adoption and dissemination of appropriate technologies are explained in
section 3-3 Dissemination to Farmers.
-
Section 3-4 Establishment of a Sustainable and Deployable Dissemination System is a compilation
of information on dissemination plans, dissemination systems, and technological developments as
matters necessary for dissemination after completion of projects.

-
In Chapter 4, solutions to enhance the rice sector in the 32 member countries are proposed for the
second phase of CARD. These suggestions are based on the output and the good practices
experienced in rice related CARD projects financed by JICA in 16 of the member countries (in the
first group). The report covering a wide range of topics based on case studies, include value chain,
policies, strategies, organization, budgets, subsidies, dissemination and research. We hope that
actors and organizations in the rice sector of each country would refer to this chapter when
evaluating the actual sector status prior to proposing future improvement measures.

Global View of Rice Sector in Sub-Saharan Africa
The trends in rice production, area harvested, and yield in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2007-2018
are described in this section with the help of FAO statistics. Statistical data concerning consumption,
self-sufficiency rate, rice price, and import volume are also presented to illustrate the changes in
rice demand and the corresponding self-sufficiency rate in the Sub-Saharan Africa.
1-1-1  Trends in rice production
The total rice production (of paddy rice)
of 45 Sub-Saharan African countries
increased from 14 million tons in 2007
(base year) to 31 million tons in 2018,
achieving the target of doubling rice
production in the first phase of CARD (Fig
1-1). Rice production did increase prior to
this period from 11 million tons in 1998 to
14 tons in 2007 but the rise was less
significant, compared to the 30 million
tons attained by the 23 CARD target
member
countries.
The
change
in
production volume of these countries is
shown below in section 1-2 Rice sector of
CARD Phase 1 Target Countries. In 2018,
these countries accounted for the majority of the rice produced in the Sub-Saharan Africa. Needless
to say, the enhanced development of domestic rice in the CARD member countries contributed
successfully to attaining the goal set in phase 1.
1-1-2 Trends in area harvested and rice yields
The rice area harvested in Sub-Saharan
Africa increased from 8 million ha in 2007 to
16 million ha in 2018. On the other hand, the
level of rice yields remains rather flat (Fig 1-2).
Rice production was doubled due to a
dominant factor: the increase in the area
harvested.
In the near future, the goal of higher rice
production should not only be attained with
the expansion of harvested area but also with

wheat (27 million tons), and rice (22 million tons) (Fig 1-3).
From 1990 to 2018, the consumption of maize declined from 56% in 1990 to 46% in 2018. In
parallel, the rate of rice consumption increased slightly from 22% in 1990 to 24% in 2018; the
quantity of rice consumed rose by 2.8 times.
The annual total consumption of rice per capita increased from 21.5 kg in 2007 to 24.0 kg in 2018
(Table 1-1). Section 1-2-3 provides more details on the total per capita annual consumption by
country. The increase in annual consumption of rice per capita is due to various factors including
population growth and rising urbanization. Compared to potatoes or other cereals, rice can be
stored over a long period of time and requires less effort to prepare and cook. Hence, its demand
tends to increase especially in urban areas where households have higher purchase power.

in Sub-Saharan Africa (maize, wheat and rice)
Source: FAO Statistics “Food Balances” (Old Food Balance: prior to 2013 and New Food Balance: Post-2014)
Data is as of 2-February 2021. As rice consumption quantities are not available, the volume consumed is deduced at it closest
value by equating it with: Domestic supply quantity- Feed – Seed – Losses – Processing - Other uses (non-food) - Tourist
consumption - Residuals. The Food Balance statistics from 2014 onwards are probably converted from paddy to milled rice.
Hence, milled rice weight = unhulled rice weight x 0.667.

1-1-4 Trends in trading and import
The aforementioned increase in rice consumption has been accompanied by a rise in the volume
of imports, bridging the demand and supply gap (Fig 1-4). As of 2018, Sub-Saharan Africa as a
whole imported a total of 10.9 million tons of rice. The largest exporters of rice to Africa in 2018
were: Thailand (5 million tons), India (2.77 million tons), Pakistan (1.36 million tons), and China (1.07
million tons). Exports from these 4 countries accounted for 95% of total exports to Africa, indicating
clearly that the majority of imports for Africa originate from Asian countries (Fig 1-5).
The self-sufficiency rate has remained between 50 and 60 per cent, with a slight upward trend,
but the rate, in itself, has not improved significantly (Fig 1-4).
The price of rice traded in the international market rose to a high 1,015 US$/t (in April 2008) due
to the global food crisis (2007-2008) but it dropped to about 400 US$/t in 2018. The latter is still
relatively high compared to the prices traded between 1991 and 2006 (Fig 1-6).
The expected growth in population will certainly lead to a higher consumption of rice; it is thus
vital to accelerate domestic rice production to meet this rising need.

Rice sector of CARD Phase 1 Target Countries
This section presents the characteristics of the rice sector of the 23 countries concerned by the
first phase of CARD. Statistical data including production, area harvested, yield, consumption
quantities, self-sufficiency rate and imports are used to identify the trends and challenges of each
country.
1-2-1 Changes in production volume
In 2018, the largest rice producers
were Nigeria, Madagascar, Mali,
Tanzania, Guinea, and Côte d'Ivoire
(Fig 1-7). They produced a total of
23.3 million tons of rice, representing
77% of the total rice (30.2 tons)
produced by the CARD member
countries in the first phase. In
particular, Nigeria, Mali, Tanzania,
and Côte d'Ivoire increased their rice
production by 2.1 to 3.5 times
compared
to
2007,
and
this
contributed greatly to doubling rice
production.
In
countries
where
the
rice
production volume is less than 2
million tons, production has risen
significantly
compared
to
their
performance in 2007 (Fig 1-8); 6.2
times in Senegal, 4.1 times in Ghana
and 4 times in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. This shows
that
with
the
introduction
of
appropriate technical dissemination
and assistance and rice production
can be improved in countries where domestic rice cultivation practices and farming techniques are
yet to be firmly established.

1-2-2 Relationship between area harvested, yield and self-sufficiency rate
The top 3 countries that had the largest area harvested
in 2018 were Nigeria (5.87 million ha), Guinea (1.86 million
ha), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1.69
million ha) (Table 1-2). The total area harvested of the
member countries in the first phase of CARD increased by
2.1 times in 2018 in comparison to the year 2007. The
countries that had the largest expanded areas were
Ethiopia (150 times), Benin (4.9 times), Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(around 4 times).
On the other hand, between 2007 and 2018, the self-
sufficiency rates of the Gambia, Cameroon, Senegal, and
Ethiopia increased by a factor of 2 (Fig 1-9). The country
in which the yield doubled was Uganda.

Based on the relationship between yield and self-sufficiency rate, the CARD member countries in
phase 1 are divided into four categories:
Major countries with high yields and self-sufficiency rates: Madagascar, Mali, and Rwanda, where
the increase in yields was highly significant.
Countries with high yields but low self-sufficiency rates: Senegal and Ethiopia. Although both the
yield and the self-sufficiency rates of these 2 countries have increased compared to 2007, the self-
sufficiency rate is still about 30%. The future increase in rice production would very much depend
on the degree of the area harvested.
Countries with high self-sufficiency rates but low yields: Zambia and Nigeria. Despite the improved
self-sufficiency rate of these 2 countries compared to 2007, the yield per unit of production has
remained flat. It is therefore important to focus on the yield improvement issues for these countries.
Countries suffering from low yields and low self-sufficiency:  Cameroon, Gambia, and
Mozambique. On the other hand, for countries like Cameroon where the area harvested has already
been increased (Table 1-2), it is necessary to take further measures for yield improvement taking
into account the area expansion.

1-2-3 Changes in consumption per capita
In 2018, the top 5 countries with the highest annual per
capita consumption were Guinea (112 kg), Sierra Leone (107
kg), Madagascar (104 kg), Senegal (79 kg), and Liberia (74
kg). The amount of consumption is rising in countries where
the traditional rice-eating culture is deeply rooted
particularly in West Africa. The consumption rates are higher
in West Africa than in Japan (54 kg) (Table 1-3). Rice
consumption is also rapidly rising in countries such as
Ethiopia, Kenya and Cameroon. This signifies that the
demand for rice in these 23 countries will only increase
annually.

In 2018, the top 3 largest rice importers were Côte d'Ivoire
(1.6 million tons), Benin (1.6 million tons), and Senegal (1.2
million tons) (Table 1-4). Countries with the highest import
growth rates compared with 2007 were Ethiopia (4.6 times),
Togo (4.1 times), Sierra Leone (3.0 times), and Madagascar
(2.9 times).
Meanwhile, Nigeria, biggest importer of foreign rice
within sub-Saharan Africa in 2007 decreased its imports to
850,000 tons in 2018. Strict restrictions of rice imports were
imposed to promote domestic rice production6.

NRDS Achievements of Target Countries
The production, cultivation area, and yield targets of every concerned country defined for the phase
1 of CARD are reflected in the National Rice Cultivation Promotion Strategy (NRDS). The achievement
assessment of these countries is described in this section.
1-3-1 Countries in Group 1
(1) Cameroon
The rice production volume in 2018 was 300,400 tons, corresponding to a NRDS target achievement
rate of 31% (Table 1-5). In 2018, the area harvested and yield were 256,206 ha and 1.2 t/ha, respectively
representing target achievement rates of 74% and 43%, respectively.
In Cameroon, the focus was on the promotion of rainfed rice cultivation. The NRDS target area was
set at a high 279,000 ha in 2018. The 6-fold increase of total area harvested in comparison compared
to 2008 concerned mainly the rainfed rice cultivation. The CARD projects in the country focused on
improving rainfed rice farming techniques and on the training of extension workers with the goal of
promoting NERICA cultivation. The number of new rainfed upland rice farmers was reported to have
increased (CMR-01).
Besides promoting upland rice cultivation, JICA technical cooperation also focused on seed
production development. The capacity of human resources was reinforced not only in technical skills
but also in the selection of appropriate varieties and in seed production. The remarkable improvement
made in seed sector was recognized by the Government as one of the major achievements7.
Table 1-5 Achievement of NRDS –Cameroon-

(MILLING) III ", March 2009, FAO Statistics “Crops” (Paddy)

(2) Ghana
The production volume in 2018 was 769,401 tons corresponding to the achievement rate of 51% of
the NRDS target (Table 1-6). In 2018, the area harvested and yield were 272,476 ha and 2.8 t/ha,
respectively, representing high NRDS target achievement rates of 72% and 70%, respectively.
High production (1,050,000 t) and cropped area (300,000 ha) targets were set for rainfed cropping in
lowland areas as it is the most common farming system in Ghana, accounting for 78% of the total in
20088. On the other hand, the development of rainfed lowland farming alone is insufficient to achieve
the target of total production; targets were also set for irrigated paddies. CARD training programs were
carried out to reinforce maintenance skills of depleting irrigation facilities, and water committees’
capacity in water management was also strengthened (GHA-06).

(3) Guinea
The production volume in 2018 was 2,339,747 tons, corresponding to an achievement rate of 86% of
the NRDS target (Table 1-7). In 2018, the area harvested and yield were 1,859,767 ha and 1.2 t/ha,
respectively, representing NRDS achievement target of 140% and 60%, respectively.
The production target in Guinea was set at a high 1,023,953 tons (almost equivalent to that of upland
farming of 1,397,479 t) as the main production in the country is concentrated in the mangroves along
the coastal areas and in the alluvial plains. The target area harvested set was also ambitious; 331,286 ha
for mangroves and alluvial plains and 861,344 ha for upland farming. As a result, the production volume
and area harvested in 2018 increased by about 2 times compared to 2008. The increase in production
is mainly due to an increase in area harvested.

(4) Kenya
The production volume in 2018 was 166,099 tons, and its NRDS achievement rate 93% (Table 1-8). In
2018, the area harvested and yield were 50,751 ha and 3.2 t/ha, respectively, representing achievement
rates of 144% and 63%, respectively and reflecting the successful increase in area harvested.
About 90% of the rice produced in Kenya is cultivated in irrigated paddy fields9, but high targets were
also set for other cultivation systems. Irrigated paddy field production increased greatly from 58,513
tons in 2008 to 146,886 tons to 2018 accompanying the increase in rainfed lowland production from
8,777 tons in 2008 to 13,120 tons in 2018.
As efforts are made to improve farming output, farmers are faced with fierce competition from
inexpensive imported rice, hindering them from selling more crops to consumers and from improving
their livelihoods9. According to a survey conducted by the JICA technical project in Mwea, rice is sold
through 2 distribution intermediaries (farmers, traders and retailers), making it nearly 40% more
expensive than imported rice (KEN-01). The need for effective post-harvest marketing and sales
strategies should be looked into in the near future.

(5) Madagascar
The production volume in 2018 was 4.03 million tons, corresponding to a NRDS target  achievement
rate of 33% Table 1-9). In 2018, the area harvested and yield were 786,265 ha and 5.1 t/ha10, respectively;
the achievement rate of area harvested was 30%.
Severe droughts in 2017 caused damages to the rice fields in the central and northern areas where
80% of domestic rice is produced. This led to a decrease in rice production from 4.91 million tons in
2008 to 4.03 million tons in 2018. The cropping area also decreased11 from 1,620,815 ha in 2008 to
786,265 ha in 2018.
In 2018, Madagascar is the 2nd largest producer among the CARD member countries in phase 1
Nevertheless, there is much place to improve local rice production as the high demand of national
consumption is presently still met by imported rice.

(6) Mali
The production volume in 2018 was 3,167,528 tons, corresponding to a NRDS achievement rate of
98% (Table 1-10). In 2018, the area harvested and average yield were 969,519 ha and 3.2 t/ha,
respectively, representing high achievement rates 95% and 103%, respectively. Mali is the second
largest producer in West Africa after Nigeria, and 90% of rice consumption is covered by domestic rice7.
The total production in 2018 doubled compared to 2008 (from 1,607,647 tons to 3,167,528 tons). In
particular, irrigated rice cultivation is thriving in the floodplain of the Niger River in southern Mali12, and
the expansion of these irrigated rice paddies is supposed to have greatly contributed to the increase in
production and area harvested. Rice production needs further expansion to promote Mali as an
exporting country in the future.

(7) Mozambique
The production volume in 2018 was 413,000 tons, corresponding to a NRDS achievement rate of
30% (Table 1-11). In 2018, the area harvested and the yield were 869,572 ha and 0.4 t/ha, respectively,
representing achievement rates of 223% and 13%, respectively. The area harvested increased about 4
times compared to 2008 (231,301 ha to 869, 572 ha).
Rice cultivation is dominated by small-scale farmers, many of whom produce only at subsistence level.
Projects operated by JICA concerned mainly small-scale farmers with the aim of improving cultivation
techniques and strengthening the activities of farming groups to improve yields.
A survey carried out amongst demonstration plot farmers revealed a yield decrease in irrigated and
rainfed lowland farming due to drought and flood damages (MOZ-04). This could be one of the reasons
for the decrease in production yield in 2018 compared to 2007. In addition, lack of sufficient support
from donors due to financial constraints could also be another cause of the decrease in production7. In
the future, there is a need to develop cultivation techniques that are resistant to difficult weather
conditions and to foresee budgetary support for rice cultivation.

(8) Nigeria
The production volume in 2018 was 8,403,000 tons, corresponding to a NRDS achievement rate of
63% (Table 1-12). In 2018, the area harvested was 5,873,615 ha, representing a high achievement rate
of 168%. The yield at 1.4 t/ha, was lower than that in 2008.
Nigeria, mainly using rainfed lowland and irrigated rice farming systems, produced the most rice
amongst the CARD member countries of phase 1. High production targets were set for rice production
using the two mentioned farming systems thereby increasing production in rainfed lowland farming
from 2,471,880 tons in 2008 to 7,021,000 tons in 2018 and in irrigated fields from 167,297 tons in 2008
to 4,480,000 tons in 2018.
Total production volume doubled from 3,465,458 tons in 2018 to 8,403,000 tons in 2018. However,
due to a lack of adequate post-harvest transformation technology, the volume of rice processed does

1-3 NRDS Achievements of Target Countries
1-13
not cover national consumption. This is one of the reasons why the volume of imported rice is higher
than other countries. Insufficient post-harvest transformation technology has become a bottleneck in
its effort to further increase the production volume. Therefore, it is important to strengthen post-harvest
processing technology in the future.

(9) Senegal
The production volume for the year 2012 targeted in the NRDS was 469,640 tons, corresponding to
an achievement rate of 31% (Table 1-13). In 2012, the area harvested and yield were 117,729 ha and 3.9
t/ha, respectively, and the achievement rate of area harvested was 36%.
The target of production and area harvested are highest in irrigated valley paddy fields of Senegal
(production: 1,088,596 tons and area harvested: 175,580 ha)
The production volume of rainfed rice in 2008 amounted to 30% of the total production but its target
production volume was set at 327,500 tons just about twice of that in 2008 (160,000 tons). Technical
assistance in this rice cultivation system is insufficient but high target values were set with the aim of
strengthening the techniques of rainfed paddy fields for sustainable domestic rice development in the
future 13 . Activities in CARD related projects included measures to improve the quality and the
productivity rainfed rice farming. The production achievement rate of the target in 2012 was as low as
31% in the production and that of cropping area was 36%. Nevertheless, the production and the area
harvested in 2018 increased by about 3 times compared to 2012, probably due to the promotion of
local rice.

Rice cultivation in Sierra Leone is mainly practiced by small-scale farmers. During the 2014 – 2015
cropping season, 44% of the farmers cultivated at least 1 ha, and 56% had less than 1 ha14. They would
have to overcome their present hurdles of using simple tools, working with limited labor and hardly any
fertilizers to attain higher yield returns.
Two strategies have been adopted in the NRDS for further domestic rice development: expansion of
cultivated area mainly on underutilized land and yield improvement regardless of rice cultivation
systems (including upland and rainfed farming). Inland valley wetland farming was improved and seed
production systems were developed in CARD related projects.

In 2018, the production, cropping area, and yield were 3,414,815 tons, 1,032,902 ha, and 3.3 t/ha,
respectively, corresponding to high achievement rates of 174%, 149%, and 118%, respectively (Table
1-15). The highest target production expected is from irrigated farming at 1,365,000 tons which
accounts for about 70% of the target total production in 2018. This target production corresponds to
large-scale irrigation development goals. On the other hand, the target area of rainfed lowland farming
was reduced from 464,000 ha in 2008 to 274,000 ha in 2018 with the doubled target yield from 1.0 t/ha
in 2008 to 2.0 t/ha in 2018. This shows a strong will to improve productivity via improved farming
systems.
Given the initiative taken in the first phase, links between research institutions and private seed
companies should be targeted to work on improved seed varieties and to distribute high-yielding
prototypes to enhance productivity.

correspond to about 60% of the total targeted production and area for 2018.
Uganda disposes of much land without adequate agricultural machinery for farm development and
thereby limiting the expansion of area harvested. There is a need to promote the use of agricultural
machinery to expand rice production.

1-3-2 Countries in Group 2
(1) Benin
The production volume in 2018 was 459,313 tons, corresponding to a high target achievement rate
of 77% (Table 1-17). In 2018, the area harvested were 135,185 ha and 3.4 t/ha, respectively, representing
NRDS achievement rates of 98% and 79%, respectively. The average altitude in Benin is 200 meters and
there are many lowland areas suitable for rainfed rice cultivation 16. Hence, high targets for both
production (from 21,000 tons in 2008 to 210,000 tons in 2018) and area harvested (from 10,500 ha in
2008 to 70,000 ha in 2018) were set in the NRDS. The expansion of cropping area contributed
predominantly to the increase in production.
The production and use of certified seeds were reported to have improved in the NRDS. The seed
production volume in 2014 was 2,800 tons, but it increased to 5,219 tons7 in recent years. Improved
access to inputs such as pesticides and herbicides also contributed to the increase in production. On
the other hand, the availability of fertilizers is still limited and its accessibility needs improvement.

Efforts were made in the first phase to expand crop acreage, resulting in an approximately 3-fold
increase in area harvested from 78,000 ha in 2008 to 207,295 ha in 2018. A large-scale rice cultivation
promotion project was also implemented in a CARD related project. Upon its completion, subsidies for
high quality foundation seeds were provided by the government to facilitate farmers’ access to
fertilizers7.

and the achievement rate of area harvested was 53%.
Increasing the self-sufficiency rate of rice is a priority for the government. Therefore, the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development's rice cultivation field became independent from the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Ministry of Rice Development was established as an
organization under the jurisdiction of formulation and promotion of NRDS. The agency responsible for
the development in the rice sector, Agence pour le Développement de filière Riz (ADERIZ)17 was
established. This initiative to create an allocated structure, that neighboring countries have yet to take,
goes to show the importance of local rice development (CIV-01) accorded by the state authorities in
the country.

17 After January 2018, Office National de Développement de la Riziculture (ONDR) was reorganized and its name was changed to Agence
pour le Développement de filière Riz (ADERIZ).

The production volume in 2018 was 1,286,872 tons, corresponding to a NRDS target rate of 92%
(Table 1-21). In 2018, the area harvested and yield were 1,693,498 ha and 0.7 t/ha, respectively,
representing a successful target achievement rate of 223% of area harvested and 39%, of yield
achievement.
Flooded lowland farming accounted for only about 2% of the farming area in 2008. With the
expectation of increasing production18 via the development of flooded lowland and flatland farming,
the target cultivated area for flooded lowland farming was set at a high 140,000 ha, which covers 18%
of the cultivated area. As a result, the total area harvested drastically expanded from 419,016 ha in 2008
to 1,693,498 ha in 2018.

The production volume in 2018 was 170,630 tons, corresponding to a NRDS target achievement rate
of 4% (Table 1-22). In 2018, the area harvested and average yield were 57,576 ha and 3.0 t/ha,
respectively, representing achievement rates of 7% and 59%, respectively.
The goal in NRDS2 is to increase crop acreage for both small- and large-scale farmers19. Required
investments in irrigated paddy fields will be done with the establishment of profitable and financially
sustainable models of irrigated paddy fields.
Women and their important labor burden is still an important underlying issue to be resolved. It is
thus important to introduce women to farming tools and machinery and provide the necessary training
to enhance their involvement in the value chain activities.

(7) Gambia
The production volume in 2019 was 22,000 tons, corresponding to a NRDS target achievement rate
of 7% (Table 1-23). In 2019, the area harvested and the average yield were 65,000 ha and 0.3 t/ha,
respectively, representing the target achievement rates of 47% and 14%, respectively. In 2013, rainfed
upland rice accounted for 62% (53,800 t/86,800 t) of the total production surpassing the 2019 target of
42% (130,000 t/306,000 t). High target areas set for irrigated paddy fields (10,000 ha) and rainfed
lowland (63,000 ha) will eventually be the next future goals.
In relation to CARD projects, the AfDB implemented a value chain management program that
included the establishment of processing plants and training of instructors in post-harvest processing
and production process management.

The production volume in 2018 was 257,995 tons, corresponding to a NRDS target achievement rate
of  29% (Table 1-24). In 2018, the area harvested and yield were 238,090 ha and 1.0 t/ha, respectively,
representing NRDS target achievement rates of 79% and 34%, respectively.
In the first NRDS, high priority is given to the development of irrigated paddy fields and rainfed
lowland paddy fields with the production target set at 273,000 tons for irrigated farming and 225,750
tons’ rainfed lowlands.
The assessment of seed development and input support program including farming equipment
improvement was also listed as activities in the first NRDS. Consequently, the establishment of the Seed
Act and Seed Board were realized through the support of the CARD to enhance the development of
seed technology7.

20 The low rate of production achievement of 4% can be attributed to the fact that the figure for 2009 (current situation) was higher than
the FAO statistic (NRDS production: 498,331 t, FAOSTAT: 103,128 t); the target also reflected higher values.

The production volume in 2018 was 119,932 tons, corresponding to a NRDS target of 33% (Table
1-25). In 2018, the area harvested and yield were 34,205 ha and 3.5 t/ha, respectively, and the
achievement rate of area harvested was 120%.
Rwanda, with the many steep slopes in the country, is threatened with a serious soil erosion problem
that may eventually affect its soil fertility. The Water harvesting and Hillside irrigation Project (LWH) was
initiated by several donor agencies to develop steep-slope soil conservation technologies and to
support the irrigation schemes21. In addition to hilly irrigated rice fields, the project also developed
lowland farming around the hilly areas, which contributed to the expansion of the cultivated area of
irrigated rice fields and lowland farming.

representing NRDS achievement rates of 72% and 47%, respectively. Although Zambia has the lowest
annual per capita consumption among the CARD member countries, rice is regarded as one of the most
promising crops due to its recent high demand that surpasses domestic production.
In a CARD related project, potential factors for increased rice production were identified and rice
cultivation techniques and adapted farming systems were introduced. In addition, a map that integrates
satellite imagery and GIS data was created to facilitate understanding of farming conditions and
environment (ZMB-02).

Overview of Rice Cultivation
2-1-1 Lifecycle of rice
Rice cultivated in Africa
Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) and African rice (Oryza glaverrima Steud.) are widely cultivated in Africa.
There are three varieties of Asian rice, including indica, javanica, japonica, of which indica varieties are
mainly cultivated in Africa. In 1992, the West Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA; presently,
Africa Rice Center) introduced the New Rice for Africa (NERICA) variety developed by crossing Asian
and African rice. Since then, 18 upland and 60 lowland varieties have been released, and they are
cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa.

Fig 2-1 Classification of rice
Source: Prepared by the JICA study team based on UGA-03, “Rice Cultivation Handbook”
Lowland and upland rice varieties are cultivated in different environments, such as lowland, flat land,
and hilly areas, in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Lowland rice is subjected to flooding during
most of the growth period (water) and require much water. Meanwhile, upland rice is cultivated in fields
and hilly areas, because it requires less water than lowland rice owing to its specific physiological
characteristics.
Growth stages of rice
Although the period required for rice growth varies depending on variety, cultivation environment,
and climate (temperature and day length), the growth stages of rice can be classified into three stages:
(1) vegetative stage, (2) reproductive stage, and (3) maturity stage.
Table 2-1 Growth stages of rice
Growth stage
Outline
1.
Vegetative
stage
It refers to the period from germination/emergence to the formation of young
panicles (panicle primordium). During this period, the number of stems can be
increased by activity tillering.
Note: Germination refers to the emergence of plumule. Emergence refers to
the appearance of any part of the plant from the soil.
2. Reproductive
stage
It refers to the period from panicle formation to heading/flowering. This period
includes panicle differentiation, panicle formation, meiosis, booting, and
heading.

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-2
Growth stage
Outline
3．Maturity stage
It refers to the period from heading/flowering to maturity. This period includes
flowering, pollination, and ripening. The ripening stage is divided into four
phases, namely mil-ripe, dough-ripe, yellow ripe, and full maturity stage.
Source: Prepared by the JICA study team based on CMR-01, “GUIDE for NERICA CULTIVATION”
The morphological characteristics of each stage are shown in the figure below.

(2) Confirmation of the status of panicle formation
As described in detail in section 2-2-4 Rice crop management and 2-3-4 Rice Crop Management, for
confirming the status of panicle formation to determine the timing of topdressing, the leaf sheath is
peeled off and visually observed, as shown in the following figure. The panicle formation stage refers

2-1 Overview of Rice Cultivation
2-3
to the time point at which the panicle length can be confirmed visually (2 mm). Fertilizer is applied after
this point to avoid lodging.

Deuxième Formation des Conseillers Agricoles 01~14
1) Same variety but different growth periods
The number of days required for growth varies depending on the variety, cultivation environment,
and climate. For instance, NERICA 4 (upland rice variety) require approximately 100 days to grow in the
tropical lowlands of West Africa, UGA-03 requires 110-120 days, and ZMB-02 requires 110-130 days.
Of note, even within the same variety, the number of growing days may vary depending on the
environmental conditions of the country or region.
2) Earliness of rice varieties
The areas for rice cultivation depend on weather conditions and vary across different regions.
Typically, varieties that require intermediate growth periods and can be naturally cultivated in specific
areas are called middle-maturing varieties. Meanwhile, varieties with that require shorter or longer
growth periods are called early- or late-maturing varieties, respectively. Thus, even the same variety can
be early-, middle-, or late-maturing when cultivated in different areas. The earliness or lateness of such
varieties is based on the length of the vegetative growth period and is determined by cultivar-specific
base vegetative growth as well as photoperiod and temperature sensitivity during transition from
vegetative to reproductive growth. The length of the reproductive and maturity periods is
approximately 30 days, and it is nearly the same for all varieties.

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques

Fig 2-5 Differences in the length of growing period in various varieties
Source: SLE-01, “Extension Material on Technical Package on Rice Production”
The upper and lower figures present examples of the growth stages of early-maturing (length, -120
days) and late-maturing (length, -180 days) varieties in SLE-01, respectively. In both cases, the period
from panicle formation to harvest was approximately 2 months, but the vegetative growth period was
respectively 2 and 4 months for the early-maturing and late-maturity varieties. However, consider that
the ripening period is affected by the weather.
2-1-2 Rice cultivation environment
Rice cultivation environments are classified into four categories: irrigated lowland rice fields, rainfed
lowland rice fields (lowland and deep-water), and upland fields. Generally, irrigated lowland rice fields
are fields in which there is a water source around the field, drainage channels and ridges are constructed
in the field, and water flow can be controlled as required. Rainfed lowland rice fields (lowland and deep-
water) are fields that can be cultivated only during the rainy season and include various environments,
from relatively small-scale lands, such as inland valleys, to vast areas, such as floodplains. Depending
on the topography, these can be divided into lands that are supplied with water by a relatively stable
rainfall, lands that easily dry out, lands that are easily flooded, and lands that easily dry out and become
flooded. Similar to that in rainfed lowland fields, cultivation in upland fields is limited to the rainy season,
and these vary from relatively lowland fields, where maize and sorghum are cultivated, to hilly areas.
Upland fields are more susceptible to drought than lowland fields. Definitions of cultivation
environment in MOZ-04 are summarized in the table below.

upland rice fields in MOZ-04 were obtained from Japanese experts.

Box. Project implementation policy for each cultivation type
Irrigated rice fields: The aim is to obtain a high yield through appropriate water management,
use of improved varieties, and high input (e.g., the yield of 10 t/ha could be obtained in SEN-01).
Rainfed rice fields (lowland and deep-water): In SLE-01, rainfed fields are classified as mangrove
swamps, inland valley swamps (IVSs), bolilands (inland basin-shaped lowlands), and reverain
grasslands (floodplains). IVSs are considered an ecosystem with the highest productivity, and
water management is possible by installing bunds in these fields. Therefore, in IVSs, the aim is to
obtain the highest possible yield by selecting fields with a higher potential and by performing
water management and fertilization (In SLE-01, the aim was to obtain a yield of 3.0 t/ha with
cultivation management.)
Upland rice fields: Cropping depends solely on rainfall, and precipitation is one of the most
important factors. Fertilization is required to obtain high yields using improved varieties, such as
NERICA, but there is a risk of unstable water supply and few farmers apply fertilizers. In areas
where upland rice is newly introduced (e.g., CMR-01), existing crops (e.g. maize, sorghum, millet)
are prioritized, and delays in upland rice cultivation may lead to water shortage in the latter half
of the cropping season, leading to decrease in yield. In CMR-01, rice cropping may even be
skipped when the conditions are clearly unsuitable for cultivation due to delays in the start of
the rainy season, light rain, or delays in sowing.
In terms of policy-making, in TZA-07, “irrigated fields” with high potential productivity are
managed from the viewpoint of national food security. In addition, “rainfed fields (upland)” and

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-6
“rainfed lowland fields” with low productivity are considered important from the perspective of
farmers’ food security.
2-1-3 Formation of rice yield
Composition of rice yield
Lowland rice yield constitutes “number of panicles,” “the number of spikelets per panicle,” “the
percentage of ripened kernels,” and “kernel weight (g/1,000 grains)”, which are collectively called yield
components. Yield is calculated by multiplying these factors. These components indicate the effects of
weather and cultivation management on yield. We expect that the knowledge of yield composition can
contribute to the preparation of farming plans and review of techniques requiring improvements to
achieve the target yield.
Key points
(1) When to determine each yield components
Each element is determined at a specific growth stage.
Since “the number of panicles” is determined by planting density, maximum tiller number, and fruitful
culm rate (number of panicles divided by maximum tiller number), it is affected by weather during the
vegetative growth period, cultivation management, and fertilization.
Since “the number of spikelets per panicle” is determined by the difference in the number of
degenerated spikeletes and the number of spikelets produced during the reproductive stage, it is
affected by fertilization at the panicle formation stage.
Since “the percentage of ripened kernels” is determined by the sterile rate (the proportion of grains
that are completely empty inside) and endosperm starch accumulation at the ripening stage, it is
affected by weather conditions from the heading to ripening stage. In particular, high or low
temperatures and drought from meiosis to flowering increase sterility and decrease yield.
“The kernel weight (g/1,000 grains)” is affected by endosperm starch accumulation at the ripening
stage. In rice, it is determined to some extent by the variety. Therefore, this component shows little
fluctuation compared with the others.
(2) Points for improving yield in each element
To improve yield, appropriate cultivation management is paramount at stages when each element is
determined. The strategies recommended for each growth stage in SLE-01 and GHA-04 are summarized
in the table below.

Recommendations
(1) Yield survey method
When measuring yield, it is desirable to perform a full harvest (harvesting the entire field to be
surveyed) such that the yield can be reliably determined. However, a full harvest is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and an alternative estimation method therefore generally used. In this method, a part
of the field is harvested to estimate the yield and yield components are analyzed.
1) Tsubogari (plot sampling)

1. Samples are collected from three
plots measuring 1 m2. Sampling plots
must be carefully selected: plots at
2. After harvesting, the number of
hills is counted for yield component
analysis. Then, five hills are sampled
and stored in individual bags.

the borders are avoided, and areas
with average growth are selected.
4. Winnowing is performed to remove
unfilled grains or other foreign
matter.
5. Mature grains are weighed.
6. Moisture content is measured.
Moisture

20-25%
immediately after harvest. Yield is
estimated assuming 14% moisture.

The points of consideration at the time of sampling is as follows:
* It is necessary to increase the number of samplings to obtain more accurate data, taking into account
the time, labor, and cost required for the survey.
* When collecting samples in a 1 m2 plot, the hills should fit in the wooden frame as much as possible.
* When applying correction, the actual planting density should be calculated and the error should be
correct by comparing with the number of hills harvested in a 1 m2 plot (average value of sample plots) .
Correction factor = (a)/(b)
(a) 1,0000/(c)×(d)
(b) Average planting density of the Tsubogari (plot) sampling plots (number of hills/m2)
(c) Average distance between rows of sampling plots = Distance between rows/number of hills
(d) Average hill distance of sampling plots = Distance between rows/number of hills
(2) Yield components analysis
Yield components are typically analyzed by selecting representative hills. The number of panicles
each 10 hills in several plots with average growth in the field is counted, the average value is calculated,
and five hills with the closest value to the average are selected. The following surveys are conducted on
the five selected hills.

(Revised edition)”

The following formula is used to calculate yield based on the yield components:
(1) [Number of hills per square meter (hills/m2)] × (2) [Number of panicles per hill (panicles/hill)] ×
(3) [Number of kernels per panicle (kernels/panicle)] × (4) [Percentage of ripened kernels (%)] × (5)
[Kernel weight (g/1,000 grains)]
Each element is calculated as follows:
1)
Number of hills per square meter (hills/m2)
* For broadcasting and drilling, rice is harvested from a 1 m2 plot and the number of hill is counted.
* For transplanting and dibbling, planting density is calculated, and the number of plants per hill
(number of grains per hills) is counted.
2)
Number of panicles per hill (panicles/hill)
* For broadcasting and drilling, the number of harvested panicles is counted and divided by the
number of hills.
* For dibbling, the number of panicles is counted and divided by the number of hills.

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-10
3)
Number of kernels per panicle (kernels/panicle)
* Regardless of the sowing methods, the number of kernels per unit area is counted and divide by
the number of panicles.
4)
Percentage of ripened kernels (%)
* This refers to the proportion of fertile kernels among all kernels. The number of floated and sunken
kernels is counted, and the number of sunken kernels is divided by the total number of kernels.
5)
Kernel weight (g/1,000 grains)
* A total of 1,000 grains (sunken kernels) are counted and weighed. Alternatively, the number of
ripening kernels with predefined weights (2 or 5 g) is counted. This is repeated three to five times
for averaging, and the number of grains per predetermined weight (grains/g) is obtained and
converted to weight per 1,000 grains.
The figure below shows an example of simple yield calculation.

Box. Yield component analysis using a semi-synchronization method (MDG-01)
For yield component analysis, in principle, the same material should be used for the survey of
yield and yield components analysis (tentative name: synchronization method) to obtain reliable
results. However, in reality, it is very difficult to conduct multiple surveys in a short time due to
challenges such as poor access to the field and difficulties in contacting the farmers. Therefore,
the following semi-synchronization method was developed for yield survey in a short time: (1)
Only three elements (number of kernels per panicle, percentage of ripened kernels, and 1000-
grain weight) are measured on representative hills in Tsubogari (plot sampling) and (2) the
number of panicles is estimated based on the yield of Tsubogari (plot sampling) and formulas
for calculating yield components.
The survey procedure is presented in the figure below:

Fig 2-8 Yield component analysis using a semi-synchronization method
Compared to the conventional method with five oblique lines that required 175 minutes to
complete the survey, the semi-synchronization method required only 80 minutes, which is less
than half the time required with the former method. Therefore, the proposed method is practical
and allow for all data to be collected on site without bringing the material back to the laboratory.

Lowland rice
2-2-1 Selection of varieties
Selection of varieties
Numerous local varieties are cultivated in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Of these, many local
varieties are photosensitive and therefore affected by the day length and have a fixed heading time.
Therefore, if the start of rainy season and transplanting are delayed, sufficient vegetative growth cannot
be achieved, as evidenced by decrease in yield due to drought and low temperatures. Meanwhile, the
improved varieties developed in recent years are non-photosensitive and require a short maturity
period; therefore, by introducing these varieties into the cropping systems, including paddy and upland
farming, yield losses due to environmental adversities, such as floods and droughts, can be avoided.
Moreover, the improved varieties show high lodging tolerance and pest resistance, strong fertilization
effect, and high cold and salinity tolerance, among other beneficial features; thus, they can easily
provide stable yield and quality. Many of agricultural research institutes examine the regional
adaptability of the introduced or cultivated improved varieties and promotes the appropriate varieties
for a specific region.
Key points
(1) Use of recommended varieties
Varieties that are clearly superior to the existing ones (in terms of yield, pest and disease resistance,
quality, and cultivation characteristics, among others) are registered and disseminated as the
recommended varieties. For instance, points to consider when selecting varieties for cultivation in GHA-
06 are listed in the table below.
Table 2-4 Points to consider to when selecting varieties for cultivation in GHA-06
1
Select varieties preferred by the target markets such that marketing of the produce
does not become a problem.
2
Select varieties with good grain quality (cooking characteristics, color, shape, taste and
aroma, and head-rice recovery).
3
Select varieties with the appropriate duration of growth to match the season. Avoid
varieties that need to be planted or harvested very early or late compared with other
varieties planted in the surrounding areas to avoid growth problems under adverse
environmental conditions.
4
Select varieties with resistance to major disease and pests and tolerance of dominant
stresses in the area.
5
Select varieties with adequate tillering capacity to shade out weeds and produce a
sufficient number of tillers for ensuring optimum yield.
6
Select varieties with adequate yield potential and stability across seasons.

(1) Important traits when selecting varieties
It is important to select varieties with higher yield than the existing ones. In addition to yield, the
following factors must be considered: pests and diseases typical of the region, environmental influences
(low temperature, flooding, drought, and so on), consumer preferences (taste and aroma), and ease of
cultivation for farmers (plant height and shedding habits).
For instance, in MOZ-04, farmers consider the following traits important. All farmers select and
cultivate several local varieties, because their cropping season is short and the yield is high. An early
harvest time gives farmers (particularly women) the time to harvest other crops. In addition, being able
to harvest quickly makes it possible to immediately secure food for self-consumption. In this way, it is
important to select cultivars considering not only yield but also the working environment and food
security of the household.
Recommendations
(1) Variety test
In many projects, comparative cultivation of local (existing) and improved varieties has been
implemented to determine the morphological characteristics and yield of the latter. In one of the
methods, farmers observe the growth and yield of each variety in a test field and select the variety that
they wants to cultivate according to the evaluation criteria recommended by the project.
In SEN-02, upland, lowland, and salt-tolerant rice varieties were cultivated according to the ecosystem
of uplands, lowlands, and saline lowlands, and the varieties were evaluated by farmers. The traits

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-14
emphasized by majority of the farmers included (1) short growing period, (2) many tillers, (3) high yield,
(4) many panicles, and (5) long stems. Among these emphasized traits, the (2) number of tillers and (4)
number of ears were selected because they are closely related to yield. In addition, the tendency to
emphasize (1) short growing period indicates the importance of stable rice production in rainfed rice
fields prone to water shortage.
Box. Good practices for lowland rice cultivation in each project
In lowland rice cultivation, local varieties are used, and early-, middle-, or late-maturing varieties
are selected according to field conditions. Under deep-water conditions, the water level
sometimes exceeds the plant height; therefore, how to avoid flood damage is important. Under
such conditions, the water level often exceeds the shore; therefore, shore construction is not
important. In addition, only few weeds can grow much; thus, weeding is not important either.
Farmers often reduce the risk of flooding damage by direct sowing half of the field and
transplanting the other half (MOZ-04).
Several different varieties are cultivated in one season (e.g., combination of early-, middle-, and
late-maturing varieties). Fields are divided into plots, with a single variety in one plot (SLE-01).
Upland rice varieties can grow in both upland and flooded fields (UGA-03).
2-2-2 Land preparation
Land preparation
Land preparation may be practiced after the first rainfall after the rainy season begins, when the soil
becomes moist, or before the start of the rainy season. The start time of rainy season varies depending
on the region and environment. In land preparation, plowing, harrowing, and puddling are the main
tasks, but strategies and farm equipment used vary depending on the scale and condition of the field.
In addition, in areas where transplanting is practiced, seedlings are prepared in parallel with field
preparation; hence, it is important to set a schedule that does not delay the work, such as when to start
the work and secure labor.
Key points
(1) Land selection
Rice requires more water than other crops. In particular, lowland rice requires flooding conditions;
therefore, when selecting a field, it is important to select a wet site throughout the cropping season. In
SLE-01, the soil is not fertility and there are potential problems of weeds, pests, and floods, among
others. These factors must be considered when selecting lowland sites in this region. In ZMB-01,
selection of wet sites throughout the cropping season is recommended to ensure adequate water
supply from planting to ripening near dumbos (seasonal wetlands) and rivers. In GHA-04, undulating
land should be avoided and flat terrains or terrains with a gentle slope should be selected as much as
possible. Furthermore, permanent rivers are the recommended water sources, and floods not exceeding
the knee height and constant soil moistening are desired.

2-2 Lowland rice
2-15
(2) Tillage and soil preparation
The purpose of tillage is to produce optimal conditions for crop growth by improving the physical
structure of the soil. Tillage is generally practiced in the following steps: (1) plowing (primary tillage),
(2) harrowing as secondary tillage, and (3) puddling. In addition, in cultivated lands, rotary tillers are
used in driven-type tillage for plowing, harrowing, leveling, and puddling. In integrated tillage with a
rotary tiller, the horsepower of the tractor may be relatively small, and a lightweight and waterproof
tractor for lowland rice fields made in Japan is suitable. The details of each practice are summarized
below.
1) First plowing
The first plowing is performed using a tractor, animal power, or human power. For instance, a 30-60
hp tractor equipped with disc and moldboard plows is used for first plowing in CMR-01, GHA-04
(northern region), KEN-01, and MOZ-02.

CULTIVATION”(right)

Box. Points to note when preparing fields for introducing agricultural machinery
In CMR-01, since there is no access road to the field, the bunds between the fields and
irrigation canal are broken during plowing and a tractor is introduced, and because the field is
not leveled well, it is polygonal. Therefore, work efficiency is poor. To enable effective use of
agricultural machinery, it is also important to improve the infrastructure that accompanies
mechanization.
When using livestock, an animal-drawn plow is attached. The advantages and disadvantages of
human-powered, animal-powered, and mechanical tillage are summarized in the following table in
SEN-02.

2) Second plowing
After the first plowing, the soil is crushed and leveled using a disc harrow, drive harrow, or rotary tiller.
Depending on the soil conditions, the soil may be cultivated and crushed using a tractor or cultivator
equipped with a rotary tiller without first plowing. In GHA-05, tractors are most commonly used, which
seems to have led to the expansion of planting area. Although plows are used for plowing, soil crushing
with disc harrows is not common, and there are many fields with insufficient leveling.
3) Puddling and leveling
Puddling is an important task conducted before transplanting or direct sowing. Sufficient kneading
of the soil after irrigation is effective for preventing water leakage from the field and controlling weeds.
In addition, elimination of clods and unevenness on the surface of the rice field and softening of the
soil render the transplanting easy. promoting the rooting of seedlings. Leveling as the finishing of
puddling improves watering by flattening the surface of the field using a wooden board and allows for
the uniform the growth of rice after transplanting or sowing.

Source: GHA-04: In House Training “LD-IHT.1-4-1 Land leveling and Paddling (Ashanti Region)” (left and center), MOZ-01: “MANUAL
ON RICE CULTIVATION” (right)
Most of the puddling work is performed manually. In GHA-04, stepping and wooden farming tools
are used to level the seedbeds, and direct sowing and transplanting without tillage are practiced.
Similarly, in SLE-01, puddling and leveling are conducted using wooden farm tools. In MOZ-01,
puddling and leveling are performed using animal power. In MOZ-02, the effects of cultivator puddling
and conventional manual puddling on yield and yield components were verified, and a significant
increase in yield and panicle number per unit area was observed when using cultivators.
(3) Repair or reinforcement and construction of bunds
The main role of bunds is to secure the necessary water during the growing season and to prevent
the runoff of fertilizer (soil nutrients) from the field due to heavy rains and floods. In fields that already
have bunds, it is important to weed, repair, and reinforce the bunds before the start of planting to
prevent water leakage. In addition, when developing a new rainfed lowland field, bund construction is
recommended in areas where with a high possibility of water shortage. In MOZ-04, bunds are very

2-2 Lowland rice
2-17
important for maintaining water in rainfed lowlands, and water retention can be improved by dividing
the surroundings of the field and the inside of the field into several plots by constructing bunds.

Photo 2-4 Soil band coating with soil paste
Source: RWA-02, “SMAP Rice Cultivation Technical Manual for Improvement of Quality and Productivity”
The above photograph shows bund repair in RWA-02. During repair, weeds on the bunds are first
cleaned and then soil mixed with water is applied on bunds for reinforcement (i.e., bund plastering with
soil paste).
(4) Basal dressing and compost
Basal dressing is applied before plowing, puddling, or transplanting (at the time of puddling) to
promote rooting and increase the number of tillers after transplanting. Of note, the amount of fertilizer
applied depends on the type of fertilizer that can be used, soil fertility, weather conditions, and variety.
For application in rain-fed lowland fields, bunds must be constructed to retain water in the field for a
certain period of time and prevent the outflow of fertilizer due to rainfall and drying of soil due to water
shortage. Although compost is not very common in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is recommended when
available because it helps improve soil fertility.

In SLE-01, the following recommendations are provided. Yield can be increased to 1 t/ha using
improved technology, and fertilization is indispensable to secure the yield beyond this value. In addition,
to obtain the fertilizer effect, leveling, use of herbicides and healthy seedlings, and appropriate water
management are imperative. In fields with water flow, the project instructs fertilizer is not applied due
to the fertilizer flows out.
Box. Example of improving soil fertility by plowing-in rice straw
In RWA-01, plowing-in of rice straw was recommended to improve soil fertility. By plowing-in
rice straw, the water retention capacity and fertility of the soil can be improved, which leads to
increase in the number of panicles, number of kernels per panicle, ripening rate, and 1000-grain
weight, and, ultimately, yield. (Scattering rice straw on the soil surface after harvest, plowing-in
it at first tillage.)
2-2-3 Planting
Seed preparation
Seeds can be obtained by self-sowing, purchasing certified (guaranteed) seeds from a seed producer
or private seed company, and obtaining certified (guaranteed) or non-certified seeds distributed with
the support of various projects. In many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, certified (guaranteed) seeds
are rarely distributed to farmers, and many farmers use home-grown seeds. The use of home-grown
seed for a long period can lead to deterioration of the quality and yield due to contamination of varieties
or reduction of pest and disease resistance. Therefore, the purchase of certified (guaranteed) seeds and
their renewal once every 3 years are recommended as much as possible. Seed preparation includes
selection, soaking, and pre-germination. It is particularly recommended for lowland rice cultivation and
is important for healthy seedling production. The purpose of seed preparation is to select healthy seeds
that are not affected by disease through sorting, soaking, and germinating; seeds of uniform quality
are selected to equalize growth after sowing.

Key points
(1) Seed selection
Seed selection is practiced to select well-nourished heavy seeds for uniform germination by using
water or salt water. For selection using water, seeds are placed in a bucket containing clean water and
stirred well. Seeds that float on the surface of the water are removed by hand, and only seeds that sink
to the bottom of the bucket are used.
(2) Seed sterilization
Seed sterilization is performed at the time of soaking to prevent seed borne diseases such as bakanae,
blast, brown spot, and bacterial blight, which occur during seedling growth, specifically when seeds that
are not certified (guaranteed) seeds (e.g., self-seeded seeds). Since the distribution of agricultural
chemicals to sterilize seeds varies depending on the country or region, their use is recommended in the
regions where they are available.
A chemical-free method of sterilization is the hot water treatment in which seeds are soaked in hot
water at 60°C for 10 min. In GHA-06, hot water treatment of seeds is recommended to control rice blast
and reduce pesticide use.

Cultivation Technical Manual for Improvement of Quality and Productivity”; GHA-06, “Optimum Input Rice Cultivation
under Irrigation”

(3) Soaking and pre-germination
Soaking and pre-germination are practiced to ensure uniform germination of seeds and water
absorption. The number of soaking days is based on the integrated temperature (temperature ×
number of days) at 100°C.
The pre-germination treatment is performed to warm the soaked seeds for germination. Pre-
germination is performed for 36-48 h, depending on weather and temperature. Seeds are placed in a
breathable bag to maintain temperature and prevent water evaporation. The sprouts should measure
approximately 1 mm after germination to avoid damage during sowing.

Recommendations
(1) Salt water selection
In addition to the above-mentioned methods using water, another method with salt water can be
used for seed selection. In this method, seeds are selected based on specific gravity; therefore, only
filled seeds can be selected. However, the cost of purchasing salt may be a burden for farmers; therefore,
it recommended depending on the local scenario. To achieve a salt water specific gravity of 1.10, 2 kg
of salt is dissolved in 10 L of water. The specific gravity can be confirmed by floating a fresh egg in salt
water.

(2) Germination test
By examining the germination rate, the required amount of seeds can be calculated in more detail,
and the viability (quality) of seeds can be evaluated. The method of germination test shows the below
table.

2-2 Lowland rice
2-21

Table 2-9 Method of germination test and evaluation
1. A handful of seeds are randomly sampled from the top, bottom, and middle of the bag; mixed well; and
50 seeds are select three times.
2. A plate (cutlery)  with a well-moistened cotton cloth is used.
3. Fifty full seeds are counted and arranged in five rows of ten; then pour water.
4. The seeds are covered with a piece of cotton cloth and placed in a ventilated place, away from rats.
5. Moisture is maintained (by watering) for 72 to 96 h and then the cotton cloth is removed.
6. Moisture is maintained (by sprinkling water) for 7 to 10 days and then the number of germinated seeds is
counted.
Judgment:
- If the germination rate exceeds 80%, the recommended sowing amount can be applied.
- If the germination rate is 60–80%, the sowing amount should be increase beyond the recommended value.
- If the germination rate is below 60%, new seeds should be selected.

Key points
(1) Semi-irrigated seedbeds
In the conventional wet seedbeds, seeds keep submerged at germination, and the sowing density is
very high; thus, the problem of spindly growth arises. However, in the case of dry seedbeds, there are
drawbacks such as requirement of frequent irrigation, troublesome management, and development of
wilt disease. There are some advantages of wet seedbeds and dry seedbeds; (wet seedbed) less damage
to birds, less weed growth, (dry seedbed) nursery does not float, and nurseries take root quickly after
transplanting. Therefore, many projects recommend the cultivation of healthy seedlings using semi-
irrigated seedbeds, which have advantages of both dry and wet seedbeds.
In the semi-irrigated seedbeds, the seedbeds are made before irrigating the water. The size of the
seedbed is 1-1.2 m wide, which is easy to work with, and the distance between furrows is 30-50 cm. The
surface is made as flat as possible and flooded to a level slightly lower than the height of the seedbed.

(2) Improved wet seedbeds
For the size of the nursery, refer to the semi-irrigated seedbeds in (1) above. A seedbed is made at
the corner of the field, where puddling is performed. The area is plowed, water is irrigated, and the area
is puddled. A rope is used to determine the width and length of the seedbed. To ensure uniform growth
after sowing, the surface is made as flat as possible by hand or using a stick.

(3) Dapog method
The Dapog method of raising nurseries is widely used by rice farmers in the Philippines. It has the
following advantages: shortening of the nursery raising period, reduction of the nursery raising area
(since there is no need to raise nurseries in the field, such as wet seedbeds and dry seedbeds, nurseries
can be raised anywhere in a sunny place), and requirement of less labor for transplanting seedlings. In
MDG-01, the roots of the nurseries are cut when the nurseries were planted, which makes it easier to
loosen and lift the nurseries and improves the speed of transplanting. However, the disadvantage is
that the nurseries are densely planted, increasing the number of nursery than usual, frequent irrigation
is required, and the nursery rearing period is short, leading to the development of small nurseries.
(4) Dry seedbed
Dry seedbeds are used to grow seedling in an upland field or backyard. It is important to select an
open place, where the nurseries receive adequate sunlight. In SEL-02, raising nurseries in upland fields
is recommended because there is a risk of flooding due to heavy rains and diseases due to high
humidity if nurseries are grown in a place adjacent to the field during the rainy season.
(5) Seedbed areas and sowing amount per hectare
In the conventional method of seedling raising, many seeds are sown in small seedbeds. Under such
dense planting conditions, competition between nurseries causes a lack of sunlight and soil nutrients,
increasing the rearing period and resulting in the development of weak nurseries that are susceptible
to diseases. Therefore, it is important to apply an appropriate nurseries area and sowing amount.

Box. Verification of yield difference due to sowing density in different seedbeds (SLE-02)
Based on the above table, the recommended sowing density of seedbeds can be 100 g/m2,
but there are almost no case studies in which the appropriate sowing density has been confirmed
by trial cultivation. In SLE-02, if yield is not affected even with the increase in sowing density, the
area of the seedbed can be reduced. From the viewpoint of reducing labor, field experiments on
the effects of various seedling densities on rice yield were conducted.
The difference in yield in the test section was considered to be due to the effect of soil
environment and climate at that time; however, no differences in yield due to differences in
sowing density were observed. Specifically, even when four times the recommended sowing
amount was used, the delay in growth after transplanting could be recovered and there was no
difference in yield.
However, when four times the sowing amount was used, severe growth competition occurred
in the nursery, and many seedlings died before transplanting; thus the recommended sowing
amount was 200 g/m2.

Source: SLE-02, “Project Progress Report (phase 3)”

(6) Nursery management
Nursery management includes fertilization, weeding after sowing, and water management, and
control of bird damage after sowing and until nurseries grow certain period.
Recommendations
(1) Appropriate sowing amount
The standard sowing amount is set depending on the cultivation area and variety; however, it is
important to determine the sowing amount that does not waste the seeds considering the seed quality
and condition of the field.
The sowing amount can be calculated based on the field area, planting density, number of plants,
germination rate, and 1000-grain weight.
For instance, if germination rate 80%, planting density is 25 hills/m2, number of hills planted is 3,
1000-grain weight is 25 g, and cultivated area 1 ha, the sowing amount can be calculated as follows:
(25 hills/m2 × 3 hills × 25) ÷ (1,000 × 0.8) = 2.34 g/m2 or - 2.4 kg/ha.
(2) Appropriate nursery raising period
When the nursery rearing period is long, the nursery becomes densely populated and tillering is
suppressed; this shortens the vegetative growth period after transplanting, and sufficient growth cannot
be achieved, which affects the number of panicles and spikelets. Particularly for early-maturing varieties,

2-2 Lowland rice
2-25
this effect is strong, and it is important to consider the work schedule, such as field preparation, to
achieve the desired the seedling raising period.
In UGA-03, the effect of different seedling ages on yield was examined using lowland rice varieties
(K-85). The yield difference was 5.9 t/ha for 3-week-old nurseries and 4 t/ha for 6-week-old nurseries,
corresponding to a 1.5-fold change. In this case, nurseries with a rearing period of 2 to 3 weeks achieved
high yields, while large nurseries were not negatively affected when using traditional photosensitive
varieties. In SLE-01, even when planted in the early rainy season, such varieties required a long growing
period, and the vegetative growth period could be secured even after transplanting; therefore, they are
preferred by farmers who grow traditional varieties. In SEN-01, in the case of dry season cropping, 3-
week-old nurseries did not grow to a size suitable for transplanting due to the effects of strong sunlight
and low temperature and required a minimum raising period of 1 month.
Transplanting
Transplanting is conducted in the order of uprooting, transportation, and transplanting. However, it
is necessary to consider the arrangement of workers and schedules such that each activity can be
conducted easily. Traditionally, large nurseries raised for 1 to 2 months are planted by cutting the leaf
tips; however, their growth is delayed, making it difficult to secure a high spikelet yield. Therefore, in
improved rice cultivation, the use of young seedlings raised for 25 days or less is recommended to
secure tillering at an early stage. However, since young seedlings taken more time for uprooting,
transportation, and transplanting than large seedlings, it is necessary to fully inform the farmers about
their purpose and handling.
Key points
(1) Uprooting
Nurseries are uprooted on the day of planting or the previous day. Before uprooting the nurseries,
the seedbed is well irrigated to soften the soil, which simplifies the task. When uprooting nurseries
(particularly young ones), they should be pulled softly to avoid damage to the roots. The uprooted
nurseries are rinsed with water to remove soil, bound in appropriate bundles (such that they are easy
to handle when transplanting and transporting), and placed in a bag or basin. If the seedlings are not
transplanted immediately, they are kept in water to prevent them from drying out.

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-26
(2) Transportation
When transporting seedlings, care should be taken to avoid drying of seedling roots, and a bag or
basin should be use while transporting.
(3) Transplanting
Traditionally, random planting is practiced, but many projects recommend line planting. Line planting
is advantageous in that it renders post-transplantation weed management easier using a weeder. In
MOZ-04, farmers practice either row planting or random planting, because row planting is time-
consuming although the yield is high and weeding is easy; because, field size, available labor, and time
spent on transplanting depend on the farmers.
For line planting, line markers are used to draw lines to guide transplanting or ropes are used to make
markings at regular intervals. The planting density (interval between plants) is set according to soil
conditions, variety, and characteristics of the target area (e.g., size, 20 cm × 20 cm or 25 cm × 25 cm).
Source: MDG-02, “Technique Spécifique Pour Riziculture Irriguée” (left); UGA-03, “Rice Cultivation Handbook” (right)

Two to three seedlings per plant are transplanted and raised for 2 to 3 weeks after sowing. It is
important to use young seedlings, old seedlings show delayed growth. If the number of seedlings
planted per hill is very high, competition between individuals may occur and yield may decrease.
If the planting depth is very high, tillering can be hindered. The standard depth is approximately 3
cm. When tillering is inhibited, the number of panicles per unit area and, ultimately, yield decrease.

(4) Refiling of missing hills
If there is a missing hill, the remaining seedlings are used for supplementary planting approximately
10 days after transplanting. Many missing hills lead to weed growth and low yield. The remaining

seedlings after refilling since prone to the source of disease so that they should be disposed of outside
of the field.
Recommendations
(1) Planting density
Planting density depends on the degree of fertilization (composition and amount) and soil fertility in
the field. If soil fertility is high, planting should be “sparse,” and if soil fertility is low, planting should be
“dense.”
In addition, the optimum planting density differs depending on the characteristics of the variety
(number of tillers, ripening period, and so on).

(2) Technique for transplanting in phosphorus-deficient fields
In MDG-03, rice yield and fertilization efficiency can be significantly improved by soaking seedlings
in a muddy liquid, which is a mixture of phosphorus fertilizer and paddy soil, and then transplanting
them (p-dipping). This treatment effectively shortened the number of growing days, avoiding the stress
of low temperatures, and increased yield by 9% to 35% compared with the conventional fertilization
method (surface fertilization).

Direct sowing
Direct sowing of lowland rice is a labor-saving method of raising seedlings and transplanting
compared with transplanting. However, to improve yield, more careful land preparation (harrowing and
leveling) is important. Direct sowing includes dry direct sowing, in which seeds are sown in the field,
and wed direct sowing, in which seeds are sown after irrigation and puddling.
Direct sowing is employed when there is no water source in the surrounding area and there is a high
risk of water shortage because water cannot be secured as needed (GHA-04 and 05); to avoid flooding
and strong wind damage after transplanting in lowlands when seedlings are small (MDG-01); there is
delay in transplantation due to certain circumstances (MOZ-04); and the field area is large and the cost
of cultivation and transplanting is high (SEN-01).
Key points
(1) Seed preparation
See the Transplantation section for details. In case of wet direct sowing, pre-germinated seeds are
often used. In case of dry direct sowing, pre-germinated dry seeds or dried seeds are used.
(2) Land preparation
For land preparation, refer to the section on transplanting until plowing and harrowing.
For wet direct sowing, puddling and leveling are conducted in the same way as that for transplanting.
It is important to flatten the field surface as much as possible. In dry direct sowing, if there was a
previous crop, the residue and weeds must be sufficiently cleaned. If such residues or weeds remain,
they use fertilizer, thus decreasing yield. For instance, in MOZ-02, after the first tillage, waterways and
ridges for furrow irrigation are constructed in the field, secondary tillage is conducted after rainfall, and
the clod was made as fine as possible to flatten the surface after sowing and uniform growth was
ensured.

(3) Sowing
1)
Wet direct sowing
In wet direct sowing, broadcasting is generally practiced. In GHA-06, after puddling, water is drained,
the field is slightly leveled, and pre-germinated seeds are sown. In addition, the following methods are
used to sow seeds uniformly in the field. The field is divided into 5-m-wide strips and marked (at a
width that can be sown by hand). The seeds are also divided into five equal lots and sown in each
section while moving back and forth in the field. The field surface should be maintained such that the
seeds are visible without sinking after sowing.

Source: GHA-06, “Guide for Optimum Input Rice Cultivation under Irrigation”
2)
Dry direct sowing
Dry direct sowing involves (1) drilling (manual sowing or manual sowing machine) and (2) dibbling.
The seeds are covered by soil after sowing. If too much soil covered, seeds will not be able to emergence.
To ensure uniform sowing by hand, broadcasting described in section 1) above or a line marker are
used.
In MDG-01, an Indonesian expert developed a drum-type dibbling seeder. In MOZ-04, a prototype
of a human-powered 2-4 drilling seeder is used, and its manufacturing method, price breakdown, and
necessary tools and information are available to the public. In SEN-02, drilling using an animal-powered
sowing machine is the most common.

Recommendations
(1) Sowing amount
It is necessary to adjust the sowing amount according to the soil fertility and variety. The table below

Drilling (depends on the
specification of the sowing

The recommended sowing amount is determined based on the results of the germination test;
however, the final sowing amount should be determined based on the results of the germination test
to avoid seed wastage. In MOZ-02, the recommended sowing amount is 100-120 kg/ha, and this
amount should be adjusted depending on the germination rate (120 kg/ha for 100% germination rate,
132 kg/ha for 90%, and 156 kg/ha for 70%). In GHA-06, farmers sow 120 kg or more seeds per hectare
in conventional farming, and the cost is also high. Therefore, to reduce the sowing amount, a field trial
was conducted to determine the effect sowing amount on yield. As a result of cultivation with sowing
amounts of 60 and 120 kg/ha using three main varieties, the difference in yield due to the difference in
sowing amount was small, and the project recommended of 60 kg/ha as the appropriate sowing
amount (when using good-quality seeds).
(2) Sowing methods (dry direct sowing)
There are three sowing methods for dry direct sowing: broadcasting, drilling, and dibbling. Although
drilling and dibbling require more time and effort for sowing than broadcasting, subsequent weeding
work can be performed efficiently.
In MOZ-04, it takes nearly 6 h per half a hectare for drilling using a manual sowing machine.

It is important to sow as uniformly as possible because the seeds are
scattered by hand.
Drilling
Sowing is performed manually or using a seeder. The spacing
between rows is 30 cm, and the sowing depth is 3-5 cm.
Dibbling
Sowing is labor-intensive, but weeding can be done efficiently. The
planting density is 20 cm × 15-20 cm; the sowing amount is 3-5
grains; and the sowing depth is 3 cm.

2-2-4 Rice crop management
Water Management
Water management is very important after transplanting to ensure high yield. The simplest method
of water management is to maintain the water level at 2-4 cm throughout the cultivation period. If the
water level is too high, the development of tillers is suppressed, which leads to a decrease in the number
of panicles and subsequent yield. If the water level is too low, weeds grow and weeding becomes
difficult.

Fig 2-13 An example of water management
Source: TZA-07 “Group Training Text”
Key points
(1) Deep-water after transplanting
The water level may be slightly deep (5-10 cm) after transplanting in order to reduce transplanting
damage and promote rooting.
(2) Deep-water at panicle initiation stage
It is recommended to maintain the water level at about 10 cm during the panicle initiation stage. In
areas where cold damage is a concern at the latter stages of cultivation (e.g., high altitude areas, such
as Madagascar and Rwanda), the damage caused by cold can be reduced by maintaining a deeper
water level (15-20 cm) for 2 weeks before heading.
(3) Retain water after fertilization
To prevent the outflow of fertilizer components, water should be retained in the field after fertilization.
(4) Water management in direct sowing
In direct sowing, water management after sowing is very important. MOZ-02 recommends the
“seeping irrigation” technique, in which the field is divided into small plots and the first irrigation starts
soon after sowing a plot is completed. Move on to the next plot when 90% of the soil of the previous
plot turns blackish because of water seeping to avoid submergence. It is optimum timing to apply the
second irrigation when the soil clods are whitish, dry, and possibly even cracked. Seeping irrigation
should be continued until germination is completed and the plant is established. Flood irrigation should

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-32
be applied when the plant reaches a height of 5-7 cm to avoid weed growth. GHA-04 recommends
increasing the water level gradually after germination.
Recommendations
(1) Construction of bunds, leveling, and securing of drainage
Constructing bunds during field preparation is important for maintaining water. Leveling the field is
also very important to maintain the appropriate water level for the entire field.
There are many problems with waterlogged field, such as agricultural machinery such as tractors and
combine harvesters cannot be used, soil fertility decreases, salt damage, and suppression of rice growth
because oxygen supply to roots is obstructed. Therefore, it is important to secure a drainage channel.
In addition, RWA-01 shows countermeasures that facilitate drainage by digging a small ditch in or
around the field.
Bunds and canals (for irrigation and drainage) need to be maintained regularly.
(2) Intermittent irrigation
In fields where irrigation and drainage can be well controlled, intermittent irrigation can save water
and increase yield. Intermittent irrigation is timed to occur after rooting or from the highest tillering
stage to the panicle initiation stage. There are several methods of intermittent irrigation. For example,
1) After irrigating to a depth of 2-5 cm, the water level naturally decreases due to permeation and
evapotranspiration. When the water level decreased to 10 cm below ground level, irrigate to a depth
of 2-5 cm again (KEN-01). 2) Repeat the process of irrigating for 3 days and letting the field dry out
for 7 days (KEN-01). 3) Irrigate to 10 cm and when the water level drops to 0 cm, repeat the process
(GHA-06). 4) Irrigate every 2-3 days (RWA-02). With case 1 of KEN-01, 20% water was saved on
irrigation, and the yield was 13% higher than that of the conventional method.
Fertilization Management
Fertilization is very important for a higher yield. Fertilization is indispensable, especially for improved
high-yield varieties. It is obvious that the expected yield cannot be obtained with insufficient fertilizer.
However, too much fertilizer has several negative effects as well, such as making the crop susceptible
to lodging, pests, and disease and reducing paddy quality, subsequently reducing the farmers’ profits.
Therefore, it is important to apply an appropriate amount of fertilizer at the appropriate time.
Key points
(1) Fertilizer components and their roles
Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) play important roles in the growth of rice. The role
of each element is as follows: N is a constituent element of protein and it promotes foliar growth. P is
a constituent element of nucleic acids and it promotes tillering and root and flower development. K has
a strong relationship with osmotic pressure and it strengthens the foliage, protecting the plant from
disease and lodging.
The following are the minor mineral nutrients needed by the rice plant: Silicon (Si), Sulfur (S), Calcium
(Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Zinc (Zn), Manganese (Mn), Boron (B), Hydrogen (H), and
Molybdenum (Mo).

(2) Top dressing
Chemical fertilizer (urea or ammonium sulfate) is used for top dressing. Top dressing is often applied
twice under the irrigation condition. The first time is to increase the number of tillers and the second
time is to increase the number of grains. On the other hand, in rain-fed rice cultivation, the cultivation
environment is complicated and it varies largely among regions. Nonetheless, top dressing is applied
at least once at the panicle initiation stage.

The Table below summarizes the points of fertilization for each project.
Table 2-16 Points of fertilization of the projects
Project code
Points
RWA-02
The dosage of fertilizer should be less in fertile soil and/or with low yield potential varieties.
Conversely, the dosage should be more in poor soil and/or with high yield potential varieties.
The first top dressing can be applied early with high tillering varieties and/or early maturing
varieties, and late for late varieties. The second top dressing can be applied early in cases of poor
rice growth, and late in cases in which rice grows well and/or with easy-lodging varieties.
GHA-06
A soil map is developed in the Kpong irrigation scheme. The soil is categorized by fertility into
three groups: low fertility, medium fertility, and high fertility. The recommended N application rate
is shown to be between 60-120 kg/ha for each location.
Based on the soil analysis results and recommendations by the University of Ghana, urea, not
ammonium sulfate (SA), is recommended for top dressing because SA makes the soil acidic.
TZA-07
The explanation for four organic fertilizers, namely, farmyard manure, green manure, compost, and
organic mulch, and the methods of making them are provided.
SLE-01
When soil fertility is relatively high, the first fertilization (basal application) can be delayed (from
the puddling stage to several weeks after transplanting). However, in many rainfed lowlands,
because soil fertility is low and excess iron toxicity occurs immediately after transplanting, fertilizer
should be applied before transplanting.
MOZ-04
When local varieties are used, the project does not recommend using fertilizer.
MOZ-01/02,
SEN-01, GHA-
06, etc.
The amount of fertilizer to be applied is expressed by the number of bags, not kg, to help farmers
understand better.
(3) Points for fertilization
Applying fertilizer when the leaves are wet with dew may cause fertilizer burn, so do not apply it early
in the morning, in the evening, or immediately after rain. In addition, if the fertilizer is not applied
uniformly, the rice plants will grow unevenly. As a result, ripening will not be uniform, the yield will
decrease, and harvesting will be difficult. Therefore, it is important to apply fertilizer uniformly.

Dissemination of the Technical Package on Rice Production through Farmer Field Schools" (right)

2-2 Lowland rice
2-35
(4) Weeding and water management
If necessary, weeding should be done before fertilization, especially before top dressing. At the time
of fertilizer application, the water level needs to be low (5 cm or less), and it needs to be maintained for
about 1 week after fertilization to avoid the outflow of fertilizer. If there is a possibility of the irrigation
water overflowing after fertilization because of heavy rain in the rainy season, it is necessary to take
measures such as draining water before fertilization. In addition, since the benefits of fertilizer cannot
be obtained without water, it is important to secure water at the time of fertilization, especially in rain-
fed lowlands.
Recommendations
(1) Importance of identifying the panicle initiation stage
Since the duration of the vegetative growth stage differs among varieties, the number of days until
the panicle initiation stage differs. In addition, since the cultivation duration of the same variety changes
depending on the temperature, the number of days varies based on the place and season of cultivation.
It is very important to identify the panicle initiation stage accurately in order to apply fertilizer effectively.
If the fertilizer is applied too early, it will cause lodging, and if it is applied too late, it will be ineffective
in increasing the number of grains.
(2) Symptoms of nutrient deficiency/excess
Symptoms caused by the deficiency/excess of elements in the soil are as follows.
Table 2-17 Rice symptoms due to deficiency/excess of element

Weed Management
Weeds compete with rice for nutrients, light, water, which causes a decrease in yield. In addition,
weeds also serve as nests for pests and habitats for rodents, and the contamination of weed seeds leads
to deterioration of paddy quality. As weeds grow, weeding becomes more difficult. Hence, it is
important to weed when the weeds are small (timely weeding). Weeding from the time of transplanting
to the highest tillering stage is especially important. Weeding should be conducted at least twice during
the cropping season. Usually, the first time is 7-14 days after transplanting and the second time is 7-14
days after the first weeding. It is also important to weed not only the field, but also the bunds and
canals. It is important to weed before fertilization in order to improve the effects of the fertilizer.
Observing and recording the types of weeds after transplanting and at harvesting make it easier to plan
for proper weed management.
Key points
(1) Weeding methods
There are three methods of weeding: manual weeding, mechanical weeding, and the use of herbicides.
1) Manual weeding
It is a method of weeding by hand or using tools such as a hoe. It is often laborious and it is impossible
to complete weeding in a timely manner.
2) Mechanical weeding
Weeding with a manual push weeder is advantageous over manual weeding because it requires less
time. Based on the KEN-01 case, the rotary push weeder does not work well with overgrown weeds,
high standing water, or a dry (hard) soil surface. According to KEN-01, the estimated time for weeding
is 10 person-days per ha when using a rotary push weeder.
The weeds that remain after mechanical weeding are to be removed by hand.
Source: RWA-01 "Technical Manual for Rice Cultivation, Water Management, and Post-Harvest Practice”

3) Herbicides
The required time for weeding can also be reduced by using herbicides (compared with manual
weeding). The use of herbicides has the advantage of reducing the required time for weeding, especially
for large areas. However, it also has the disadvantage of increasing production cost.
Photo 2-13 Push weeder for lowland rice

2-2 Lowland rice
2-37
There are two types of herbicides: non-selective and selective. Non-selective herbicide is used before
cropping, at the land preparation stage. Selective herbicides are used for weeding after planting. Since
the target weed species differs depending on the type of herbicide, read the application standard
carefully before use. In addition, since the water management method differs depending on herbicide,
attention should be paid to usage to optimize the effect. For example, SEN-01 states that the field
should be flooded when Londax (component: Bensulfuron methyl) is sprayed, and drained when
Propanil (component: Propanil) or Weedone (component: 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; 2.4-D) is
sprayed. The effectiveness of the herbicide decreases as weeds grow, so timely weeding (when the
number of weed leaves is 2-3) should be done. It is also important to weed the remaining weeds
manually after spraying.
Spraying should be done from upwind to leeward to avoid damage to health. Do not spray in strong
winds or high temperature. Keep in mind that the unused herbicide should not be drained into canals
or rivers.
Source: SEN-01 Guide du Vulgarisation de la Riziculture Irriguée “10- Gestion des mauvaises herbes”
(2) Points for weeding in the direct sowing method
In the direct sowing method, weed seeds and rice seeds germinate simultaneously, and the number
of weeds in the field increases every year, so weed management is always necessary. For example, in
MOZ-02 (dry direct sowing), weeding is conducted three times in total, twice in the first half of the
tillering stage, and once 70-80 days after sowing. Herbicide usage is recommended for the first weeding,
with manual weeding for the second and third weeding. In addition, it is more effective to repeat the
use of herbicide twice; the first time immediately after sowing and the second time 20-25 days after
sowing. In MOZ-04 (dry direct sowing), weeding is conducted at least twice, and the first weeding is
conducted 5-7 days after germination. GHA-06 (wet direct sowing) recommends spraying non-selective
herbicide one day before sowing, spraying selective herbicide 11-14 days after sowing, and manual
weeding 60-70 days after sowing.
(3) Weeding in rain-fed lowland
Rainfed lowland requires earlier weeding than with irrigation. For example, in GHA-04, weeding
should be conducted at least twice, 3 and 5 weeks after sowing. A hoe is used for the first weeding and
herbicide for the second. On the other hand, weeds are not a problem in the deep-water condition.

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-38
Recommendations
(1) Utilization of high-quality seed
The emergence of weeds can be prevented by using high-quality lowland rice seeds that are not
mixed with weed seeds.
(2) Land leveling
If the soil is not well leveled, the soil surface will vary in height. The high part will be exposed above
the water surface and weeds will grow easily. Therefore, land leveling is important for weed control.
(3) Line planting
In order to conduct mechanical weeding, it is necessary to perform line planting at the time of
transplanting (drilling or dibbling in direct sowing). In addition, with line planting (drilling or dibbling),
it becomes possible to use manual weeding tools such as a hoe, reducing the work involved in weeding.

Pest and Disease Management
The types of pests and diseases, and the timing and frequency of outbreaks vary depending on the
region and year. Some diseases can be prevented by using resistant varieties or seed disinfection.
However, there are diseases that cannot be prevented and must be dealt with only after their occurrence.
Pest and disease control measures include 1) physical control (fire, animals, traps, nets, noise, etc.), 2)
biological control (beneficial insects, biological agents, etc.), 3) cultivated control (resistant varieties,
etc.), and 4) chemical control.

Recommendations
(1) Use of certified (guaranteed) seeds and seed disinfection
The use of certified (guaranteed) seeds and seed disinfection can prevent seed-borne diseases in
particular.
(2) Seed amount/planting density
Poor ventilation and overcrowded conditions can promote the outbreak and reproduction of pests
and diseases, so an appropriate amount of seeds should be used and the planting density should be
suitable.
(3) Weeding inside and outside the field for pest control
Weeds and bushes inside and outside the field can be habitats for insects and fungi, so weeds should
be removed.

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-42
(4) Points for chemical use
Change the chemicals used regularly to prevent the development of resistant pests and diseases.
(5) Appropriate amount of fertilizer
Excessive N application may promote the outbreak of pests and diseases.
Bird and Animal Damage Management
Bird damage occurs most often between the heading stage and ripening. It is not easy to prevent
bird damage, and in most cases, birds are chased manually. The following physical measures are used
to prevent bird damage: setting up a bird net, placing a sounding device around the field, setting traps,
etc.
Source: GHA-04 “In-House Training “
In addition to physical countermeasures, countermeasures such as planting surrounding fields
simultaneously to avoid being targeted by birds and avoiding cultivation when there are many birds
can be considered.
Animal damage includes feeding damage by rodents to leaves, stems, and grains. Physical control by
installing fences or traps, cleaning around the field frequently to eliminate hiding places of rodents,
using rodenticides, and flooding during the ripening stage to keep rodents away from rice plants are
possible countermeasures.
2-2-5 Harvesting
If the harvest is too early, immature grain will be included, and if it is too late, cracked rice grain will
have been produced and the quality of paddy will be low. In addition, if the harvest is too late, yield will
decrease because of lodging by rain and wind, grain shattering, bird and animal damage, insect damage,
etc. Timely harvesting is important for achieving high quality and high yield of paddy.
Drain Water before Harvesting
Drain the water in the field at least 7-15 days before harvest to facilitate harvesting. In addition,
draining water during the ripening stage has the effect of maintaining the vitality of the roots,
synchronizing the ripening, and suppressing harvest loss.
It is necessary to drain water in a timely manner to dry the field properly, especially when using a
combine harvester.
Photo 2-15 Bird damage countermeasure using a bird net

2-2 Lowland rice
2-43
Judgment of the Harvest Timing
The harvest timing is often determined by the change in the color of the panicles, and in most cases,
harvest is timed to when 80% of the whole panicles (grains) turns yellow. The following are examples
of other ways to judge harvest timing: when the entire paddy field turns yellow, when the color of the
panicle neck changes, when the water content becomes 20-25%, or when grains shatter when lightly
grasped. One method to estimate the water content of grains for harvesting without using a moisture
meter is by checking the hardness of the rice grains. The ideal hardness would be if they do not break
easily when chewed.
Another method is to use the number of days after heading to judge harvest timing. However, since
the number of days can be affected by the weather (for example, 25-30 days after heading in GHA-06,
30-45 days after flowering in NGA-01, and 40-50 days after heading in RWA-02), it is necessary to
determine the optimum number of days for each target area.
SLE-01 advised that because it is difficult to thresh with moisture from morning dew, harvesting in
the early morning should be avoided.

Fig 2-15 Image of timely harvesting
Source: RWA-02 “Refreshment Training Workshop for FFS Facilitators on Rice”
If the optimum time for harvest is missed, the incidence of cracked grain (section 2-4Post-harvest
Processing) will increase, which often impairs commercial value, so caution is required (In some
countries such as Senegal (SEN-03), where cracked grain has almost the same commercial value as
perfect grain; however, this is only if the cracked and perfect grains are properly sorted). According to
MOZ-01, the harvest and milling loss is estimated at 15% or more and 25% or more 10 days and 20
days after the optimum harvesting date, respectively.
Harvesting Method
(1) Manual harvesting
Manual harvesting is suitable when the field has not sufficiently dried, or the field is small. In case of
varieties with high shattering characteristics, the harvest loss becomes large.

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-44
1) Harvesting by hills
This is a method of cutting entire rice plants at a height of 10-25 cm from the ground using a sickle,
knife, or sword. This method is suitable when the yield is high because of high work efficiency. It is
important to use a tool that cuts well to avoid shattering. In Guinea (GIN-01), it is estimated that manual
harvesting by sickle requires the labor force of 5-12 persons/ha, while in Senegal (SEN-02), the required
labor force is 20 persons/ha.
2) Harvesting by panicle
In this method, a knife or scissors are used to cut under the panicle neck. When the ripening is not
uniform, this method has the advantage that the only ripened panicle can be cut.
(2) Mechanical harvesting
The major machines used for rice harvesting in Africa are the reaper and the combine harvester.
1) Reaper
As shown below, the reaper can be adjusted to a cutting width and height of 30 cm and 10-30 cm,
respectively. The transport units consist of a chain and a guide rod, and they transport the cut rice and
discharge it to the right of the machine. Its structure is simpler than that of the combine harvester, and
because it is compact and walkable, it is possible to adapt to the size and shape of the field. However,
varieties with high shattering characteristics tend to exhibit higher harvest loss. Among CARD target
countries, KEN-01 and TZA-07 use reapers, and locally made reapers were introduced in SEN-03 on a
trial basis.

1) Combine harvester
A combine harvester is a harvesting machine that threshes and cuts simultaneously. Although many
farmers aim to start using it because of its high work efficiency, among the CARD target countries, it is
used only in countries with relatively advanced mechanization, such as KEN-01, MOZ-01, SEN-01/03,
TZA-07, and GHA-06, because it is expensive and requires developed field infrastructure and
experienced operators.
The guidelines for harvesting by combine harvester are shown next page.

Water depth measurement
Lodged rice should be harvested manually (harvesting
lodged rice with a combine harvester will result in large
harvest loss)
Access the field straight for ease of control of the
machine; it can tip sideways if the operator drives at an
angle. An assistant machine operator guides the
operator. Place a bridge structure appropriately and
ensure it is stable enough for the combine harvester to
pass over.
Manual cutting at the corners is suggested to avoid
damage to the crop during access and while turning
corners.

Upland Rice
2-3-1 Variety selection
Selection of varieties
Upland and lowland rice cultivation is practiced in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and local
varieties are cultivated. Many of the local varieties of upland rice are photosensitive and are affected by
day length. Sowing is delayed due to fluctuations in the beginning the rainy season, making it
impossible to achieve sufficient vegetative growth. In addition, due to the effects of rainfall during the
rainy season and drought caused by the early end of the rainy season, sufficient water cannot be
obtained and desired yield and harvest cannot be achieved. Meanwhile, in recent years, improved
varieties such as those exhibiting lodging tolerance, high fertilizer application effect, short growing
period, and pest and disease resistance have been developed. Among these, the upland NERICA variety
is being introduced and disseminated in each country through multiple projects as upland rice variety
developed by the Africa Rice Center (WARDA) since 1992.
The varieties to be introduced are selected by taking a limiting number of factors into account, such
as agroecosystems, rainfall, temperature, and soil conditions. In addition, depending on the purpose of
production, early-maturing varieties (upland NERICA rice) are recommended in regions with little
rainfall and where the main purpose is self-consumption.
Key points
(1) Use of recommended varieties
Similar to lowland rice varieties, upland rice varieties are also registered as recommended varieties
(yield, pest resistance, quality, cultivation characteristics, and so on.), which are recognized as clearly
superior to the existing varieties. The table below shows the varieties that are widespread in sub-
Saharan Africa. In particular, when selecting upland rice varieties for cultivation in rainfed fields, it is
important to pay sufficient attention to not only yield and quality but also the natural environment
(weather and soil) of the area in which they are introduced.

Box. About NERICA
According to some reports, NERICA can product stable yield without fertilization. However,
fertilization or cultivation in fertile land is recommended for NERICA as much as possible.
Repeated cultivation on the same land decreases soil fertility. Therefore, a sustainable farming
system must be established by crop rotation with beans, which effectively improves soil fertility
via nitrogen fixing, and by repeated cultivation of different types of crops on the same cultivated
land for a certain period of time.
NERICA is a drought-tolerant variety. However, CG14 (Oryza glaberrima Stued.), the paternal
variety of NERICA, consumes much water. Therefore, NERICA varieties require much water and
are less drought tolerant than other crops, such as maize, millet, and sorghum. In addition, rice
yield is drastically reduced under severe drought. Therefore, NERICA should not be cultivated
instead of maize, sorghum, and
millet in arid and semi-arid zones.

(2) Important traits for selecting varieties
Similar to lowland rice varieties, yield and disease resistance are important traits for upland rice
varieties; however, to avoid the risk of drought damage due to water shortage, drought resistance and
length of cultivation period are also important traits for upland varieties. In addition, salinity tolerance
is an essential trait because there are areas in which salt accumulation occurs due to drought. In the
variety selection test conducted at SEN-02, farmers selected the three traits, namely yield, cultivation
period, and shattering habit, as the most important traits. There were four reasons for selecting varieties:
early growth, high yield, high environmental adaptability, and good taste.
2-3-2 Land preparation
Land preparation
Upland rice is cultivated on not only flat land but also hilly and sloping areas. Land preparation begins
with the removal of weeds and residues from the previous crop in the field or newly developed land,
followed by first and secondary tillage (harrowing and leveling). These activities use human power (hoe),
animal power (cow, horse, or donkey), and agricultural machinery, such as tractors. On slopes (hills), the
runoff of surface soil due to heavy rains during the rainy season and wind is a problem. In particular,
when nothing has been planted in the field at the start of cultivation and there is only a small amount
of vegetation, heavy rains during the rainy season lead to soil erosion, which decreases soil fertility. In
addition, upland rice is often planted upland fields, and soil fertility may be reduced due to the
cultivation of maize and vegetables as the previous crop and repeated cropping of upland rice.
Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the selection of upland rice fields.
Key points
(1) Land selection
The table below shows the criteria for selecting suitable land for upland rice cultivation for each
project.
Table 2-21 Criteria of selecting land for each project
Project code
Good practices
CMR-01
Rice can be cultivated on slopes, but it is important to sow it
perpendicular against the direction of the slope to avoid soil
erosion due to rain. A sunny land should be selected. Salt-
damaged areas should be avoided. Cultivation following cassava
as the previous crop should be avoided. The field should be far
from grazing lands. If damage by domestic animals is anticipated,
fencing is recommended.
TZA-07
Although NERICA 1 has some degree of drought tolerance, it prefers moist soil. Thus, is should
be sown in highly fertile and moist soils. It should be cultivated at a lower level than other field
crops, or in a areas where the soil is too moist to be used for maize cultivation. It should not be
grown on steep slopes.
UGA-03
Lowland rice varieties are preferred as much as possible to obtain water required for maturation.
Upland varieties can also be cultivated as a mixed crop with maize, soybeans, bananas, or coffee.

2-3 Upland Rice
2-49
Project code
Good practices
ZMB-02
Lowlands where seepage water can be used should be selected as much as possible. Soils with a
high water holding capacity (preferably dambos), fertile, and rich in organic matter, sandy-loam to
clay-loam with a pH of 4.5-7.0 is preferred.
In TZA-07, there was not enough information to determine the target area for upland rice cultivation;
hence, areas that are not necessarily suitable for rice cultivation, such as those with adverse weather,
high humidity, and low rainfall, were selected. Therefore, when starting upland rice cultivation,
meteorological conditions of the target area should be thoroughly examined in advance.
(2) First plowing
Land preparation is almost the same as that for lowland rice, starting when the soil becomes soft
after the start of the rainy season and weeds and residue of the previous crops in the field are removed.
In the first plowing, it is desirable to remove as much roots and clods as possible to make leveling easier
(refer to the section on land preparation of lowland rice for details).

Photo 2-18 Slashing of bushes and weeds (left) and removal of weeds by burning (right)
Source: CMR-01, “GUIDE for NERICA CULTIVATION”
(3) Second plowing
It is important to crush the clods into smaller pieces by second tillage and to make the soil surface
as flat as possible to achieve uniform growth after sowing. In particular, in the case of drilling or dibbling,
it is necessary to make furrow for sowing at a certain depth; thus, soil should be sufficiently crushed
and leveled (refer to the section on field preparation for paddy rice).

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-50

(4) Ridge and terrace construction
When cultivating on slopes, the higher location, the lower the water content of the soil. Therefore,
construction of terraces surrounded by ridges is recommended to secure water during the growing
period.
The photographs below show a field on the slope in UGA-03. In the left photograph, because the
ridges are built around it, seeds do not run off due to rainfall, and no missing hills are seen. In the right
photograph, because there are no ridges, seeds are washed away by rainfall and many hills are missing.

(5) Basal dressing and compost
The timing of basal dressing varies depending on the project, from the time of tilling to approximately
3 weeks after sowing. In addition, compost is not required when the soil is fertile, but it is applied
depending on soil fertility.

Box. How to prepare rice straw compost?
In CMR-02, rice straw compost was introduced as a type of compost that can be easily prepared.
Only rice straw is used, and rainfall is the water source. 1. Rice straw is piled. 2. The straw is mixed
every month after raining. 3. Soil is applied before plowing.

It is important for farmers to use materials that are simple to handle and readily available.
Source: CMR-02, “Généralités sur le riz”

Recommendations
(1) Cultivation on slopes
In MDG-01, cultivation on slopes (sloping fields) of 5% or less is possible. Of note, differences in soil
moisture content at the top and bottom of the slope can also affect yield. The figure below shows
harvest at different slopes in UGA-03. Growth deteriorates as the vertical distance from the groundwater
level increases. Therefore, higher locations should be avoided as much as possible, and a location close
to the groundwater source should be selected.

2-3-3 Planting
Direct sowing
Direct sowing is commonly practiced in upland rice. The main activities include seed preparation (see
paddy rice section), sowing (see paddy rice section), and supplementary planting.
Key points
(1) Seed preparation
A germination test is recommended after seed selection, and the germination rate is estimated before
seed preparation (see the section on paddy rice for the germination test method). In winnowing, light
kernels and foreign matter are removed by wind, leaving only heavy kernels. For water selection, refer
to the section on lowland rice. However, in the case of direct sowing, seeds must be dried in the sun
after water selection.
(2) Sowing
1) Seeding rate
The seeding rate varies depending on the variety, soil fertility, and sowing method used. Compared
with transplanting cultivation, direct sowing uses more seeds.

2) Rainfall and sowing time
The table below shows the amount of rainfall and sowing time for upland rice in each project.
Table 2-24 Criteria for rainfall in each project
Project code
Good practices
CMR-01
Rainfall is one of the most important factors for the growth of upland rice. Although it does not
require much water at the early growth stages, insufficient rainfall from the panicle formation
stage to the milky stage (2 weeks before harvest) decreases yield.
SEN-02
For upland rice cultivation, cumulated rainfall of 600 mm or more at regular intervals for 3 months
or more is required.
TZA-07
Upland rice grows well in areas with annual rainfall of 800-1200 mm (optimally 1000-1200 mm).
Rainfall is required throughout the growing season.
UGA-02
Based on 20 years of rainfall data, it is recommended that no fertilizer be applied in areas with
little rainfall. In addition, by analyzing the probability of rainfall, it is recommended that the scale
of rice cultivation be reduced and it be mixed with field crops (e.g., maize) in regions with
continuous dry weather for 5 days or more.
UGA-03
Upland rice grows well in areas with rainfall of 20 mm or more for 5 days from sowing to 15 days
before harvest (approximately 90 days).
A map of suitable land for NERICA cultivation in Uganda (UGA-03) and neighboring countries was
created based on annual rainfall, altitude, and soil pH.

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques

3) Seeding method
There are three seeding methods: drilling, dibbling, and broadcasting. Drilling is recommended in
many projects because of the ease of weeding, fertilization, and harvesting after seeding. In addition,
seeders and line markers for drilling have been developed and improved in some projects.
For details of each technique, refer to the section on direct seeding of lowland rice (dry-seeded rice).
Box. Use of seeders for purposes of other than rice seeding
When using a seeder used for purposes other than rice seeding, attention must be paid to
variations in seeding amount as the number of holes and grooves in the seeding machine vary.
In SEN-02, a sowing machine for crops with different sowing boards and a sowing machine
developed in the project were compared; the number of emergences after sowing were counted,
and an appropriate sowing machine for upland rice was examined. The 32-hole board developed
in the project was suitable considering the sowing density (2-8 Mechanization of Rice Cultivation
for details).

Recommendations
(1) Seeding depth
Because sowing depth has a great effect on growth after seeding, a depth of 3 cm is recommended.
If the seeding depth is low, the number of hill deficiencies increases due to the runoff by heavy rains
after seeding and feeding damage by birds, which decreases yield. Meanwhile, if the seeding depth
very high, the overall growth is delayed and yield is reduced due to decrease in germination rate and
delay in ripening with delayed emergence.

Photo 2-21 Differences in growth due to different sowing depths
Source: UGA-03, Rice Cultivation Handbook”
Box. Differences in emergence among varieties
Using five upland rice varieties (3737, Boing22, FOFIFA161, NERICA4, and Sebota70), the
following test was conducted in MDG-01. The sowing depth was set from 1 to 6 cm at 1 cm
increments to identify strong and weak varieties for deep sowing. The emergence rate of
NERICA4 was extremely poor when it was sown deeper than 3 cm, and the emergence rate of
other varieties did not decrease when the depth was changed by 5 cm, whether it was deep or
shallow. Therefore, the standard sowing depth recommended by many manuals was 3 cm. Of
note, however, this value varies depending on the variety.

Achievements (Revised edition)”

2-55
(2) Refilling of missing hills
Decrease in the yield of upland rice can be prevented by refilling the missing hills in the same way as
that for lowland rice. Small seedlings are raised as supplements at the corners of the field.
Supplementary planting should be performed 15-20 days after sowing and sufficient irrigation should
be ensure to allow rooting as much as possible.
Pre-germinated seeds with uniform germination sown at an appropriate sowing depth, proper pest
control, and prevention of surface soil and seed runoff by ridge construction around the field are
recommended.

2-3-4 Rice Crop Management
Water Management
The soil of upland paddy fields is usually sandy, and it is difficult to retain water in the field. Although
water freely seeps underground, little water flows on the surface. If the field is surrounded by a bund,
water does not flow out and it can penetrate the soil, which contributes to increasing the moisture
content of the soil. In MOZ-04, it is recommended that if farmers cultivate an upland crop before rice,
the ridge of the crop be utilized for a bund for the upland rice cultivation.
Fertilization Management
Fertilization management is as necessary as it is for lowland rice cultivation.
Key points

Box. Transplanting of upland rice
Upland rice is cultivated under non-flooded conditions; thus, direct sowing is desirable.
However, in MOZ-04, the transplanting method is practiced. In this region, sweet potatoes,
legumes, and cassava are cultivated as the previous crop; thus, field preparation for upland rice
must start after the harvest of previous crop. Therefore, since the sowing time is later than usual,
seedlings raised earlier in another place are transplanted as soon as field preparation is
completed.

The effects of top dressing at each stage are as follows: at the tillering stage, it increases the number
of tillers, at the panicle initiation stage, it increases the number of grains, and at meiotic stage, it
promotes grain filling (increases percentage of ripened grains).
As the roots of the rice plant absorb fertilizer after it dissolves in water, it is more effective to apply
fertilizer when the ground is moist. Rice plants and weeds compete for limited fertilizer, so it is important
to conduct weeding before fertilization. Fertilizer should not be applied during cloudy or bad weather
because the stomata of rice plants do not open completely and transpiration is reduced, which leads
to the roots absorbing less fertilizer.
The table below shows the points of fertilization for each project.
Table 2-26 Points of fertilization of the projects
Project code
Points
CMR-01
Basal fertilizer is unnecessary where rice is cultivated for the first time, but rice grows better when
it is applied.
UGA-03
Rice should not be grown continuously on the same fields; it should be rotated with other crops
to conserve soil fertility. Composted organic material such as rice straw and animal manure can
be added to the soil to supplement soil fertility.
MOZ-04
Local varieties are used for upland cultivation, and the project does not recommend using
fertilizer.
Weed Management
The basic weed management method is the same as the method used for lowland rice, but weed
management is more important for upland rice because weeds grow more easily with upland rice than
with lowland rice. Weeding is conducted at least twice during the cropping season in many projects;
the first time is 2-3 weeks after germination, and the second time is 6-7 weeks after germination. It is
also important to conduct weeding not only in the field, but also around the field to reduce damage
caused by rodents.

2-3 Upland Rice

Key points
(1) Effect of weeding
The effect of frequency of weeding on rice yield was investigated in UGA-03, and the yield of the plot
that was weeded 3 times was about 4.8 times higher than that of the plot with no weeding conducted.

(2) Weeding method
Weeding by hand or by hoe is common. It should be noted that herbicide cannot be used for weeding
upland, because it should be sprayed when the field is flooded.
(3) Crop rotation
In SEN-02, it is stated that crop rotation is one of the means of controlling weeds in upland rice
cultivation.
Recommendations
(1) Development of the weeder
An example of mechanical weeding in upland rice cultivation is SEN-02 weeding using livestock and
a weeder. When livestock and a traction-type weeder that is generally used for upland crops were tried
in the target area for upland rice weeding, the growth of rice was inhibited and the yield was largely
reduced. The negative impact was caused by the shape of the weeder, soil conditions (soil quality and
moisture), planting interval (the planting interval of other crops are as wide as 60-80 cm), skills and
experience of workers (including livestock), etc. In particular, when the first weeding was carried out at

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-58
2-3 weeks, because the rice plant had only 4-5 leaves at that stage and it was still short, some plants
died because they were buried in the soil.
Based on the trial results, the project tried to develop an original weeder (attachment) for upland rice
cultivation. The core structure of the developed weeder is a trapezoidal iron frame; its upper side is 40
cm, its lower side is 20 cm, and its height is 40 cm. It is a traction-type weeder and it cuts weeds with
the blade on the lower side (Photo 2-23). The weeder is structured such that the inverted soil spreads
outward and does not bury the rice plants. The weeder can be manufactured at a blacksmith.

As described in 2-2-4 "Box. Examples of weeds found in Africa,” the characteristics of weeds in upland
rice cultivation are summarized in “Major Rice Weeds in Uganda” in UGA-03 and presented with their
photos.

Box. Comparison of labor force required for upland rice cultivation and other crop
cultivations
By comparing the labor force for rice (rainfed lowland and upland) cultivation with other crops
(millet, maize, sorghum, groundnuts, and sesame) in SEN-02, it was found that the labor required
for weeding in rice cultivation is much larger than the labor required for other crops. This results
in the labor force for rice cultivation being about five times larger than that for other crops.

Pest and Disease Management
Basic pest and disease control is the same as it is for lowland rice.
Key points
(1) Types of diseases
It has been reported in CMR-01 and TZA-07 that NERICA, which is a representative variety of upland
rice, has high resistance to diseases (especially blast and RYMV), and it is said that no special disease
control is needed in CMR-01. In addition, ZMB-02 listed blast, sheath blight, and brown spot, and UGA-
03 listed RYMV as upland rice diseases (details of all the diseases are described in 2-1).

Other insect pests found in upland rice cultivation include stink bugs (CRM-01), mole crickets (SEN-
02), and stalk-eyed flies (UGA-03) (all described in 2-1). CMR-01 recommends using pesticides when
approximately 20% of the field is affected by insect damage.

(3) Countermeasures against pests and diseases
For pest control, it is important to use resistant varieties, disinfect seeds, use seeds and seedlings that
are not infected with diseases, weed the field, use recommended cultivation techniques, ensure
appropriate planting densities, and rotate crops.

Bird and Animal Damage Management
The basic control method is the same as the method for lowland rice, but it is important to note that
upland rice can be damaged by livestock and poultry, and that it is more susceptible to rodent damage.

Fig 2-20 Bird damage during the rice growth cycle
Source: CMR-01 “GUIDE for NERICA CULTIVATION”

Box. Heavy work of bird chasing (CMR-01)
Even in Africa, countries that have been cultivating rice for a relatively long time (e.g., Guinea)
have a custom of chasing birds with families and in groups. In order to prevent bird damage,
which occurs mostly in the morning and evening during the harvesting season, bird huts are
often built in the fields to chase birds throughout the day. Since Cameroon has no crops that
require chasing birds, many farmers find it burdensome. The project has identified the problem
of bird damage through field monitoring conducted multiple times from 2012 to 2013, and has
proposed countermeasures. In a survey conducted in 2013, it became clear that the most difficult
problem in upland rice cultivation is chasing birds.

2-3-5 Harvesting
The harvesting method is the same as the method used for lowland rice.
CMR-01 and CMR-02 indicate that it is better to harvest after 9-10 am to avoid dew. In case of rain,
wait until the rain stops. However, if it rains every day, the crop can be harvested, but the paddy should
be dried immediately after harvesting.

Post-harvest Processing
The post-harvest processing of rice varies depending on the degree of popularization and
development of rice cultivation as well as the level of technology in the country or region; however, it
is essential to prevent post-harvest loss and quality deterioration in this series of processes, as shown
in the figure below22. For instance, the introduction of a consistent technology package from harvesting
to storage was reported to reduced grain weight loss by half from 14.8% to 7.3% (MDG-01) or
harvesting 1 week earlier reduced harvesting and threshing losses from 10% to 4.3% (TZA-07).

22 The destoning process by destoner is not included in this figure. It is desirable to remove stones together with other impurities during
the rough sorting process before husking; however, if it is difficult to introduce the rough sorting machine, stone removal is performed
after the rice milling process. ASI in the figure refers to a throw-in, powered thresher made in Senegal.

2-4-1 Threshing
Outline
In general, many rice varieties grown in sub-Saharan Africa have easy shattering characteristics
compared with the Japanese varieties. Therefore, the conventional rice threshing method of beating
rice ears against a metal barrel or a log or beating of rice ears spread on a sheet using sticks is practiced.
Threshing by cow stamping is also adopted in some regions, such as Madagascar. Moreover, machine
threshing is recommended in many projects against the backdrop of the dissemination of hard-to-
shatter varieties (e.g., NERICA4) through the JICA projects and the rising demand for work efficiency
associated with increased rice production. When using a combined harvester, this step is omitted
because harvesting and threshing are performed simultaneously.
Key points
(1) Measurement of grain moisture contents
Threshing with appropriate grain moisture content is important, because if drying is insufficient, it
may lead to poor threshing and mechanical failure in the threshing machine. For drying before threshing,
a direct placement-type technique is used in the field, which is easy under dry conditions (MOZ-04). In
rainfed lowland areas where water remains even at the harvest time, the harvested rice is placed on
stems remaining after the harvest (GHA-04) or leaned against the bunds between paddy plots (CMR-
02) to prevent the rice ear from soaking in muddy water and consequent deterioration of the quality.
Grain moisture content can be easily measured using a moisture meter if available. The operation of
the moisture meter is summarized in the post-harvest processing manual (SEN-03 and others). A
simplified technique to manually estimate moisture content without a device is presented in section 2-
2-5 Harvesting.

Box. The original aroma of rice and signs of changing behavior (CMR-02)
To produce high-quality rice, producers must understand the required quality level; however,
farmers who have grown up eating rice smelling of mud or mold for many years do not know what
the problem is if they are allowed to smell it. In this condition, it is difficult to make farmers
understand the meaning of preventing the ear of rice from soaking in muddy water or drying it to
the proper moisture content. Therefore, the project asked farmers to smell the original fresh smell

of paddy rice, which was properly dried without soaking in muddy water, the puffy smell of cooked
rice, and the smell of muddy and moldy rice and to compare the tastes; this improved the degree
of understanding of quality among farmers.
According to UNDVA, a C/P organization of the project, farmers are aware that the selling price
of paddy varies depending on the quality of rice (the purchase price of paddy by UNDVA can be
divided into three levels according to the quality of paddy: 200, 150, and 125 CFA/kg). Farmer now
try to preserve the quality of rice, such as by intentionally delaying the cultivation period so that
rice can be harvested after water recedes from the paddy fields.

(2) Prevention of the loss of paddy and contamination with impurities
Threshing on a plastic sheet is recommended for
both manual and mechanical threshing to prevent
loss due to scattering of the paddy during the
process and contamination of the threshed paddy
with seeds of other plants, stones, and soil (see
Photo 2-26). In some countries where manual
threshing is practiced, workers are instructed to
remove their shoes to prevent contamination with
mud.
When threshing different varieties, it is important not to leave the paddy of the previously threshed
variety in agricultural machinery and tools. In particular, agricultural machinery contains residues inside
(paddy left inside the machine) that are difficult to see. Therefore, it is necessary to understand its
internal structure by referring to the schematic drawing of the threshing machine in the manual and
disassembling and cleaning it.

(3) Tips for manual threshing
Manually beating rice ears against a metal barrel or a log not only increases the loss of paddy but
also causes cracks in the rice kernels. To
prevent these problems, several good practices
are observed, such as the use of a wooden
threshing stand (Photo 2-27), a wooden box
called the “Bam-Bam Box” (Photo 2-28), and
shifting the point of striking rice ears on stones
to the ear neck side (Fig 2-22 shows a bad
example on the left and a good example on the
right).
(4) Tips for machine threshing
There are two main methods of machine
threshing: a simple foot-pedal thresher and a
power-operated thresher with a diesel engine.
In addition to the points of attention
introduced in (1) and (2) of this chapter, the
typical points to be noted in the operation and
maintenance of threshers are summarized in
the table below.

Good practices by projects
(1) Optimization of thresher (RWA-02)
In Rwanda, the traditional threshing method is to manually hit the harvested rice against a tree (Photo
A). Later in the project, a foot-pedal thresher (Photo B) was introduced; however, the number of people
who could perform threshing work at the same time was limited and improvement of work efficiency
was needed. Therefore, the project simplified the thresher using locally available eucalyptus trees as the
main material. As a result of this simplification, the manufacturing cost was reduced and the number of
threshers increased, enabling simultaneous work and shortening of the threshing time. However,
because paddy grains are more likely to scatter in this method than in the foot pedal-operated method,
it is necessary for an assistant worker to lift the bottom of the plastic sheet in the position directly facing
the operator to prevent paddy scattering (Photo C).

2-4-2 Drying and processing
Outline
When the moisture content of grains is lowered by drying, the action of enzymes, which are the basis
of biochemical reactions and require reaction with water, is suppressed, and the respiration and
decomposition reactions of the paddy itself are suppressed. In addition, the rate of biochemical
reactions of parasitic insects and microorganisms, such as bacteria and molds, decreases, and their
activity and reproduction are suppressed. However, it should be noted that improper drying may cause
cracks in rice and affect the quality and quantity of the product. The causes of grain cracking include

malnutrition of rice, high temperature immediately after
heading,
and
delayed
harvesting.
In
post-harvest
processing, rapid drying at high temperature and high
temperature during the milling process are the main causes
of grains cracking (Fig 2-24).
Key points
(1) Target grain moisture contents
The target grain moisture content varies depending on the
purpose of use. For instance, the recommended range of
moisture content is 13%-15% for milled rice or paddy for
storage and 12%-13% for seeds (Table 2-32).
(2) Drying
Mechanical drying, such as flat-bed drying, has not been
observed in the projects conducted so far, and paddy is
commonly sun-dried manually by spreading the threshed grains
on a concrete pavement or plastic sheet and dry slowly under the
sun with periodic stirring and turnover for uniform drying.
Table 2-28 summarizes the thickness of the paddy layer on the
pavement or plastic sheet, drying method, and frequency of
paddy stirring. It is necessary to set the thickness of the paddy
layer and drying time based on temperature, humidity, and
rainfall pattern in the target area of each project.

Drying on a sheet or pavement. Paddy is stirred every 1 hour for 3-4 hours per day

content is slowly reduced to the target percentage over 2-4 days, and grains are stored
on the 5th day.
GHA-04/06
5-10 cm
On sunny days, paddy is stirred every 30 minutes 7-8 times a day (the number of times
increases according to the moisture content). During the day, the surface temperature
of the drying area exceeds 50 °C, leading to grain cracking; thus, rice is covered on hot
times of the day or dried for several days. When it rains, the paddy is protected with a
waterproof sheet (or tarpaulin).

Rice is dried after threshing and rough grading (sieving), stirring every 30 minutes. The
temperature of paddy rice is measured at regular intervals, and rice is transferred to

and 42°C for seed production). The paddy is transferred under the roof or covered with
sheets at night and in rainy weather to protect from animals and birds.

Rice is dried slowly and uniformly by stirring every 30-60 minutes to allow equal
exposure to the sun. Daily reduction of paddy moisture content of <3% per day is
recommended.
ZMB-01

Rice is dried slowly for 3 hours a day for 3 days, with frequent stirring for uniform drying.
(3) Winnowing
Winnowing is conducted manually or using a machine to remove impurities, such as straw and chaffs,
contained in paddy after threshing. For instance, in MOZ-03, the aim was to prevent an increase in the
moisture content of paddy and insect damage by removing impurities and harmful insects through
winnowing before transporting the paddy from the threshing site to the warehouse.
Good practices by projects
(1) Construction of drying spaces (CMR-01/02)
In the tropical forested region of Cameroon, rainfall during paddy drying was an issue; therefore,
drying spaces with a roof were constructed near farmlands. Analysis of the effects of different drying
methods on the proportion of cracked grain revealed that the proportion was 65%-70% with rapid sun
drying and it was improved to 30%-35% with drying in the shade (Fig 2-25).

(2) Tips for drying with parboiling (NGA-01)
The moisture content of paddy subjected to
the parboiling process23 is as high as 30%-
35%. Because plastic sheets do not absorb
moisture from the paddy, rice drying on sheets
on a well-swept pavement is recommended.
This method differs from the conventional
drying method in that the thickness of the
spread paddy layer is recommended to be 2
cm or less to facilitate drying. The target
moisture content is 12.5-13%. If a grain
moisture meter is not available, moisture is
checked by biting the de-husked rice (brown
rice) with teeth; a crisp and strong shearing
feeling (click sound) is an indication of proper
drying.
(3) Verification of the optimum grain
moisture content (MOZ-01)
It is important to know the optimum grain
moisture content for improving rice milling
recovery and proportion of head rice.
Therefore, the project prepared samples with
different drying times under sun light and analyzed the data to clarify the effects of different moisture
contents on rice milling recovery and head rice proportion. As shown in Fig 2-26, rice milling recovery
and head rice proportion reached the highest value at a grain moisture content of approximately 15%,
and the values decreased with increase or decrease in moisture content beyond this threshold.

23 Parboiling involves a series of soaking, steaming, and drying of paddy before milling (Kimura et al., 1976, “Research on Parboiled Rice”).

(4) Profit loss by over drying of paddy (SEN-03)
Decrease in the moisture content of paddy traded on a weight basis leads to grain cracking and
ultimately profit loss to reduced weight. In Senegal, where the relative humidity is low, the project
explained to the C/P organization that a decrease in the water content per 80 kg of paddy rice from
15% to 8% is equivalent to a decrease in the sales of 6 kg of paddy. Since then, they have become aware
of the importance of controlling moisture content and have made efforts to improve rice quality.

2-4-3 Rice milling
Outline
Rice milling has a great impact on quality and is an area that needs to be developed for the future
regional distribution of rice. In the single-stage milling method, the “Engelberg” miller is used for
simultaneous rice hulling and milling; this method is widely used in the region, even though the rate of
the cracked grain is high. Therefore, several projects have shown the possibility of improving the quality
of rice by adopting multi-stage milling with multiple machine; different machines perform the functions
of husking (rubber roller husker), milling (polisher), and sorting (to separate paddy, brown rice, and
milled rice) (MDG-01, SEN-01 and SEN-03).
A quality standard system based on the size of grains (head, broken, immature, and other grains) and
the contamination ratio of impurities (red, yellowish, or milky-milled rice grains), as observed in Asian
countries, has not been well established in this region. However, price differentiation with differences
in quality, possibility of selling in the off-season using storage facilities, and market needs for rice
branding has gradually been confirmed.

Key points
(1) Husking and milling
The commonly used rice husking and milling methods in sub-Saharan Africa include (i) the Engelberg
method; (ii) the one-pass rice milling method in which the upper part of the machine performs the
husking function with a rubber roll and the lower part performs the milling function; and (iii) the multi-
stage rice milling method in which multiple husking and milling machines are used. The outline and
characteristics of each method are shown in the figure below.

This machine was originally designed for removing rice bran from brown rice, but it can also perform hulling and milling simultaneously,
like the Engelberg miller.

(2) Destoning (removing stones)
Stones should be removed by through rough sorting, which is a step prior to charging the paddy rice
into a rice miller. However, only a limited number of rice milling companies have such equipment (CIV-
01 and SEN-03). Some stones are removed during rice milling depending on the type of rice miller used;

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-72
however, to completely remove stones from milled rice, a rice destoner is necessary. Rice milling
companies and distributors do not have a rice destoner usually remove stones by hand-picking. In
addition, in one case, the parts inside the rice miller were damaged due to defects in stone removal
(MOZ-01, 02). Rice with few or no stones is in high demand by consumers and is therefore traded at
high prices under the name of “stone-less rice” or “stone-free rice.” In NGA-01, stones were mixed with
rice from harvesting to shipping of milled rice on at least three occasions. Therefore, rice destoner is
essential to completely remove stones (Table 2-29).

(3) Separation/sorting
Separation includes sorting head rice, large cracked grains, and small cracked grains according to the
grain size and removing grains of different colors such as discolored grains. Cracked grains are removed
with a vibrating sorter or manual sieve, and discolored grains are removed by hand picking or using a
color sorter. The extent to which sorting and separation is required is determined by the level of market
demand (2-6 Rice Farming Management and Value Chain Development).
Recommendations
(1) Considerations for selecting the rice milling method suitable for variety and purpose of use
The suitable rice milling method should be determined based on the rice variety, purpose of use, and
quality standards required by the market.
For instance, in SEN-03, the process suitable for short-grain varieties is “Abrasion (Grinding) → Friction
→ Friction → Polishing” and the process suitable for long-grain varieties is “Abrasion → Abrasion →
Polishing”; the finest combination introduced is “Abrasion → Abrasion → Abrasion → Polishing →
Polishing” (corresponding to the flow from “Paddy” to “Milled/Milled rice" in Fig 2-21). Nonetheless, in
NGA-01, the proportion of cracked grains could be maintained at approximately 15% even with the use
of the Engelberg-type rice miller by adopting proper parboiling processing and recommended a milling

2-4 Post-harvest Processing
2-73
system in which milling was performed twice followed by polishing at the bottom of the rice-milling
machine.
(2) Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
Appropriate maintenance is essential for the sustainable operation of rice milling machines. For
instance, in CMR-01/02, out of 50 CFA per kg of milling service charge, 23 CFA is reserved for future
rice milling machine purchase costs, installation costs, and operator salaries; 17 CFA is used for
consumables, such as fuel, oil, rubber rolls, belts, and others; and 10 CFA is used for tools and labor
cost for repair work. In TZA-07, out of 60 Tsh per kg of milling service charge, 20% is used for
maintenance and management costs, 10% for operator cost, 30% for electricity cost, and 40% for saving
the replacement of expensive spare parts and machines. Securing spare parts is a common challenge
in all countries. The key points of the O&M of the rice milling machine directed in CMR-01 are
summarized in Table 2-30.

Good practices by projects
(1) Assistance to rice milling companies (SEN-03)
The Senegalese market has a unique characteristic in that broken rice has almost the same
commercial value as the head rice. However, proper selection of head rice and broken rice is essential
for improving product value. Therefore, the project procured six sets of milled rice sorters with a
destoner, vibrating sieve, and two bucket elevators on a trial basis and loaned them to small-scale rice
milling companies to demonstrate that even they can produce high-value-added rice. The selling value
may be improved by separating head rice and broken rice via proper selection, as shown in the table
below.

(2) Trial of the mobile rice mill service (UGA-03)
As a trial of rice milling business in rural areas where
road traffic networks and electric power facilities were
insufficient and far from the milling station, a mobile
rice mill service was introduced by placing a one-pass-
type rice miller and an engine generator on a truck bed.
This service had rice milling capacity of 200 kg/h and
milling recovery of 62.2%.
(3) Establishment of the Farming Support Group
(FSG) (MOZ-01/02)
The project introduced small-scale rice milling
machines
in
many
regions,
established
and
strengthened an organization with an appropriate size to operate and maintain the milling machines
(called FSG), and introduced a microcredit system. The project provided the FSG with guidance on how
to ensure a sustainable rice milling business from the project implementation period, instilled quality
control and cost concepts, and led to organizational revitalization.
To calculate the cost of rice milling machines, there were no standards in Mozambique for calculating
O&M costs at the time; therefore, the project referred to the Japanese standards and set the annual
repair cost at 4% of the purchase cost (approximately 24,000 Mt/year) and specified in the internal
regulations that a reserve of 2,000 Mt/month should be set aside. In addition, the project instructed the
FSG to ensure thorough payment and record labor costs, which are of particular interest to farmers,
without exception. As a result, the operation of the rice mill has contributed to a reduction in the
workload of rice milling, and the FSG has been able to secure a profit from rice milling business, thereby
enabling fund raising for the construction of a warehouse for paddy and for the participatory
rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage canals.

In addition, the rice milling business using the rice milling
machine introduced in MOZ-02 has been successfully running
even though six years have elapsed since the end of the project
(Photo 2-32).
According to the FSG representative, the average annual rice
milling over the past 10 years was approximately 21.7 t/year.
However, in addition to the difficulty in obtaining compatible
spare parts, the number of customers has decreased
significantly due to the establishment of new rice mills with high
processing capacity near the district in recent years.
(4) Introduction of wooden mortar (CMR-01)
In CMR-01, a wooden mortar and pestle was provided to
farmers, considering the high possibility that powered milling
machines will fail to pay off in areas without electricity.
Although the mortar has a disadvantage of increased
proportion of broken rice compared with rice milling machines,
farmers’ demand for buying wooden mortar was confirmed.
(5) Establishment of a parts supply center by a large-scale rice millers’ association (SEN-01/03)
In SEN-01 (phase 1), a large-scale rice millers’ association (ANR: Association Nationale des Riziers in
French) collected copayments from those who installed rice milling equipment and based on this
copayment, established a fund that can be used by the members of the association when they install
new equipment for rice milling. However, after the completion of project, the fund was not being used
at all; thus in SEN-03 (phase 2), discussions were held with ANR, and a parts supply center was
established using the fund. This center aims to procure and manage spare parts for rice milling
machines and sell them to the necessary companies. As of November 2020, the center has been selling
spare parts to member companies. The Association of Agricultural Machinery Service Providers in other
areas of the country (Podore Department) came to know about this activity and requested ANR to
provide expertise for establishing similar centers in other regions.

Box. Development of improved parboiling
techniques (NGA-01)
The
“improved
parboiling
technology”
developed in NGA-01 covered only two states
during the project phase, but it was later taken over
by the JICA Nigeria Office, which employed 10,605
parboilers nationwide (as of 2017).
Some improvements in the processes of washing,
soaking, steaming, and drying in the parboiling
were achieved during the project, such as the use
of a false bottom at the paddy steaming stage. The
project promoted an aluminum false bottom made
of a sand mold casting for small pots (560 mm in
diameter) and an iron false bottom of the right-left
separation type for easy taking in and out for large
drums (1,400 mm in diameter). However, because
the large iron false bottom can easily rust and is
expensive, it did not take root in the end.
Later, in local parboilers, a 15-20-cm-thick layer of
rice chaff is deposited at the bottom of the drum,
called the “chaff layer,” as a substitute for the false
bottom. This is superior to the iron false bottom in
terms of cost, durability, and ease of handling, and
this is a good practice that the Nigerians have
embraced based on the basic concept of “to steam
paddy without contacting with hot water,”
recommended by the project as an improved
parboiling technology and flexibly adapted to local
conditions by themselves.

2-4-4 Transportation and storage
Key points
(1) Transportation
To minimize the loss of rice during transportation, it is necessary to review the transportation route
(shortening the distance) and prevent rice from falling out of the truck or cart when being transported
from the field with ears by ensuring that the sheet placed on the truck or cart is not damaged.

2-4 Post-harvest Processing
2-77
(2) Storage environment
Many projects have recommended the use of pallets; a system of piling bags (height and piling
patterns); isolation between bags and wall; ventilation system; antitheft; material of bags; prevention of
the breakage of bags (hammering a nail head); and prevention of damage by animals, birds, and insects.
Examples of a typical layout of storage and system of piling bags are as follows.

(3) Paddy moisture content and approximate storage period
As described in the drying and processing section, storing the paddy after drying to appropriate
moisture content enables storage of the paddy without quality degradation due to humidity and mold.

Recommendations
(1) Motivation of quality control for storage manager
As a lesson in SEN-03, it is important not only for rice producers and rice millers but also for storage
managers to understand the importance of quality control of rice during storage and to motivate them.
The project provided training on quality control to both rice millers and storage managers, but the
awareness of storage managers was insufficient. Moreover, moisture control of paddy was not
conducted properly. This is because the main purpose of the storage is to store the paddy, and even if
the storage manager manages the appropriate moisture content of the paddy, it does not pay the
manager a sufficient amount of money and it does not benefit the persons concerned with the storage.

2-5 Seed Production
2-79
2-5
Seed Production
Local varieties are generally adapted to their surrounding conditions displaying high resistance to
biological and abiotic stress in that particular area. However, they are often not high-yield breeds. The
use of good quality seeds of improved varieties would be more likely to improve yield. Adaptability
assessments and seed registration should be carried out prior to the introduction of improved varieties
from Asia and another region. On the other hand, when breeding improved varieties, it is useful to
integrate the genetic characteristics of local varieties for their environmental adaptability and accepted
taste. JICA projects has been supporting on the breeding of: i) RYMV resistant varieties in Uganda, ii)
high yield, cold resistant and drought resistant varieties in Kenya, and iii) low phosphate resistant
varieties in Madagascar.
2-5-1 Seed production system
A certified seed production system generally involves: maintenance of breeder seed and foundation
seed by research (breeding) institutions, production of registered seed by parties like semi-private seed
production corporations, and production of certified (guaranteed) seed by seed producers (farmers)
and private vendors. Certification is done by public seed inspection body.
The right diagram illustrates the inter-
relations of actors involved in seed
production in Madagascar.  In short,
FOFIFA, a research institute produces and
supplies breeder seed and foundation seed
to a seed producer (GPS). CFAMA, another
research institute develops and provides
agricultural machinery for seed production.
ANCOS,
a
seed
inspection
institute
performs seed certification, and the Seed
Production Corporation (CMS) purchases
seeds produced by GPS. Support in seed
production techniques is provided by the
PAPRiz Project. As shown in this example,
many actors are inter-related in the seed
production system. Its success depends on
the efficiency of each actor. Currently, many
countries in Africa tend to encounter difficulties in their seed production systems. Hence, there is much
for improvement as far as producing good quality seeds are concerned.
Some projects support non-certified seed production by improving the quality of self-produced
seeds by farmers. Examples of seed production challenges and supporting projects are explained in 2-
5-5.

2-5-2 Quality Seed Criteria and Role of Seed Inspection Bodies
1）Criteria of Quality Seed
The criteria for quality seed are as follows: i) Varietal purity (unmixed with other varieties, free from
seed contamination of other crops and/or weeds, ii) Seed viability with high potential germination rate,
free from seed-borne diseases, insects, and pathogens and iii) Desirable seed characteristics: seed size,
fulfilling grains, uniformly fine and not mixed with damaged grains.
Sowing good quality seeds leads to production increase, higher selling price due to quality
improvement, and the increase of profit due to low input. As a result, yield can increase by 5−20% by
using quality seeds like CIV-01 and GHA-06, and the case of CM-02 where the average yield increased
by 1.5 times.
There are several causes of seed mixture: natural crossing, genetic mutation, and mixture by self-
seeding. Special attention should be paid to avoid mixture during seed handling by farmers and
inspectors (e.g., during post-harvest inspection, storage, and sowing).
Proper storing is also important. Seeds are sensitive to storage conditions and should be stored in a
cool and well-ventilated place to prevent damages caused by insects, rodent and humidity.  Moisture
contents of seed should be below 13% for long conservation and re-drying is necessary if stored in
humid conditions. Prior to storage, clear indications (harvest date, variety name, seed category, weight,
and producer’s name) should be made on the seed bags to facilitate easy identification.
2）Roles and challenges of seed inspection bodies
The main roles of the seed inspection body are i) registration of the seed producers, ii) field inspection
of registered seed producers, and iii) laboratory test of produced seeds. Field inspections are often
carried out twice, during the booting stage and the heading stage, in CARD target countries. The
following tests are carried out in laboratory; measurement of germination rate and visual observation
of contaminated varieties, weed seeds, stones, mud, pests, etc.
However, in many countries, the certification of guaranteed seeds is challenged by several factors:
limited number and capacity of seed inspectors and inspection equipment, field inspections are not
carried out at appropriate timing and frequency, resulting in the certification of low-quality seeds.
2-5-3 Process of certified (guaranteed) seed production
Fig 2-31 shows the process of certified (guaranteed) seed production. Seed production is composed
of several steps which may have an impact of the seed quality. Factors that can hinder the production
of high quality seeds include low purity of the upstream seeds (breeder seed, foundation seed and
registered seed), mixed with other varieties during farming and/or after harvesting.

2-5-4 Good Practices for Seed Production in the fields
There is often confusion between seed production and paddy production amongst farmers. Hence,
in addition to the description of the seed production process mentioned above, here are some good
seed production practices that should be considered for producing high quality seeds.
The main points and objectives of seed production are:
-
Select a plot isolated from plots planted with other varieties (to avoid unintentional crossbreeding).
-
Avoid using plots where rice of other varieties was planted in the previous year (to avoid mixing of
volunteer seeds from the previous year in germination).
-
Implement seed disinfection (to prevent seed-borne diseases).
-
Use transplanting instead of direct sowing and the transplants one plant per hill if possible (for
easy detection of off-types).
-
Remove weeds in the paddy fields and along the bund (to prevent contamination of weed seeds
and outbreaks of pests and diseases)
-
Implement uniform fertilization (to avoid uneven growth due to uneven fertilization, which makes
it difficult to distinguish from genetic variation)
-
Carry out roguing (remove undesirable off-types) several times especially after heading (to prevent
mixing of seeds).
Avoid collecting seeds at the edge of the fields (to avoid cross-pollination).
-
Avoid collecting seeds from flooded or dried-up fields (disturbed growth may result in difficulties
to identify off-types)

Off-types can be determined by plant form, leaf (length, width, angle, and color), number of tillers,
panicle length and shape, spikelet (number, length, shape, and color), awn (existence or non-existence,
length, and color), timing of heading/ripening, seed shattering, etc.

Support for seed production can either be for non-certified seeds (self-produced seeds) or for
certified (guaranteed) seeds and/or upstream seeds.

Additional remarks (*)

【A support model on how assistance can be provided within a restrained time period and
financial means】
Given limited time and financial means, it was concluded that it would be difficult to improve
the seed certification system. On a more practical scale, farmers were provided technical
training in self-production of rice seeds in the project.
【CIV-01】
【A support model on how a series of assistance was provided for production,
certification, distribution and sales of rice seeds】
Seed producers had opportunities to receive training from other donors and NGOs, but
training materials specific to rice seed production were not available. Training on seed
certification procedures and technical advice was given to seed production organizations
in this project. A rice seed production manual and a guide were also compiled and handed
over to the concerned parties.
The project also attempted to help connect seed producers with agricultural input
distributors and extension agencies for the purpose of distributing and selling certified
seeds.
【SEN-02】
【A support model for the production of original seeds】
The production of foundation seed from breeder seed on the project managed plots
facilitated the task of obtaining high quality foundation seeds by seed producing farmers.
Capacity building of seed production groups foreseen in the project helped the registration
of participants as official seed producers thereby improving their capacity of producing
certified seeds.
*In Ghana, the Seed Law does not allow the production of registered seeds and certified
seeds produced from foundation seeds.
【GHA-06】
【A support model of how promotion for the use of certified seeds can be made through
TV commercials】
A TV commercial was broadcasted to promote the use of certified seeds by a well-known
actor, encouraging the use of self-produced local variety seeds for higher yields.
【MDG-01】
【A support model for the purification of breeders seeds and foundation seeds】
Seed purification was carried out by a short-term expert in this project to improve the purity
of breeder seeds and foundation seeds. Training of farmers in seed purification of local
varieties, which is not carried out by public institutions, was also carried out.

Box. Local Seed Multiplication Program (MOZ-04)
The local seed multiplication program proposed by the Nampula Seed Inspection Center in
Northern Mozambique in 2003 with an innovative approach led by the provincial economic office
in on-site product review of seeds produced in farmers' fields. Only seeds that meet certain
criteria can be distributed within the county as “Guaranteed seeds”. Very often, only improved
varieties and not popular local varieties amongst farmers are incorporated into the public seed
multiplication system. However, with this new approach, multiplication of highly demanded local
varieties is made accessible to all. This approach also allows rural producers to have easier access
to seed suppliers. Three field inspection exercises are conducted with this approach at each phase
of the cropping season: after transplanting, at heading and prior to harvesting. Only successful
seeds are sent for screening at the laboratory to verify contamination rate and moisture contents
followed by germination tests. Only successful seeds would be certified as “Guaranteed Seeds”.

Development
Rice farming management is an important skill for farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa who have acquired
improved rice farming techniques to increase their profit margins. The majority of these farmers practice
small-scale farming, who rarely consider farm planning or cost management to evaluate their expenses
and earnings. Often, profit margins are not often maximized as rice is sold at a low price. The purchase
of farming materials is not easy for many farmers with little access to financial assistance. Hence, the
use of effective techniques by the farmers is undermined given such circumstances. Many projects
financed by JICA looked into these difficulties and aimed to improve farmers' management via multiple
means including the introduction of farming management, reinforced marketing, organizational
support to improve profitability and better financial access.

2-6-1 Farm planning and management
In order to improve productivity by suitable cropping, it is important to develop farming plans with
an appropriate cropping calendar. It is also essential to visualize profits through accounting
management and income-expenditure analysis, as well as to have the appropriate techniques to
enhance profitability and optimize agricultural investment to ensure sustainable rice cultivation
management
Farm planning
The first step to better management using recommended cultivation techniques is to prepare a
farming plan before planting. Appropriate cropping should be done according to farm plans prepared
in advance to optimize output provided by any technical packages.

See "Cropping calendar" below

Box. Agricultural management planning in a farming group
In the projects in Ghana (GHA-04 and GHA-05), the
target farmers were instructed to prepare action plans
(farming programs) according to the cropping
calendars. The farmers' groups, with mutual accord,
then cultivated according to their action plans
specifying target production volume, cultivation period,
and variety. Training in creating action plans
accompanied by planting calendars and accounting
management like the given example were conducted.
Source: GHA-04 “Onsite Training”

version)

(2) Preparation of cropping calendars
A cropping calendar is prepared by taking into account local weather conditions and variety
characteristics. It is an important process for the effective regulation of water in irrigated paddy fields
and for the cultivation planning of rainfed paddy and upland rice, staying in harmony with rainfall
patterns. It would also be useful to have a list of major local varieties with maturity classification to
program planting and harvest periods.

Cropping calendar is a useful tool for promoting suitable cropping. Nevertheless, it may not be easy
for farmers not familiar with this or for those with little schooling. Hence, simple and easy to use formats
would be ideal to facilitate the important use of cropping calendars for both extension workers and key
farmers.
(3) Optimization of agricultural investment
It is important to strike a balance between expected output, agricultural investment, and optimized
agricultural investment when preparing farming plans. Depending on the regions, there is a
simultaneous under and over-use of fertilizers in Sub-Saharan Africa. The following issues should be
considered to maximize profits when examining agricultural investments.

In GHA-06, the baseline survey revealed high excess of fertilizers in seeding rate, planting density,
and fertilizer level, making the optimization of the input level challenging. The Optimum Input Rice
Cultivation (OIRiC) approach was introduced in the project to recommend agricultural investments that
maximize returns. Training in appropriate cultivation management, namely, the, use of quality seeds,
seed preparation, and improvement in the amount and timing of fertilizer and pesticide applications,
was also provided.
Accounting management
Smallholder farmers with little schooling find cost and income bookkeeping rather challenging.
Hence, training and workshops were conducted to get these farmers acquainted with the subject by
way of introducing easy-to-understand formats. It is only obvious that with the knowledge of income

2-6 Rice Farming Management and Value Chain Development
2-89
and expenditure calculations derived from production costs, gross profit (sales amount), and net profit
(gross revenue - production cost), production problems can be identified and remedied more easily.
Teaching the farmers to create a balance sheet after each cropping season also helped them to be more
aware of the way to improve the farming management and increase yield quantities in the next cropping
season.
Key points

only discourage farmers from this
practice. Hence, it is important to

circumstances and customs.
(2) Income
and
expenditure
analysis
It is important to keep in mind that
the composition of production costs
varies depending on the farming system as well as the cultivation method, and to present the simplest
possible way for farmers to analyze their income and expenditure. There is a need to organize
workshops to reinforce farmers’ capacity to select profitable cultivation methods and farming materials
based on the merits (increase in production) and demerits (increase in production cost) system
(example: Fig 2-34).
Production costs: Total of material costs + labor costs + land costs + water management costs + farm
machinery usage fees, etc. (changes depending on cultivation conditions)
Gross revenue  : sales
Net revenue    : gross revenue less production costs
(1) Recording operations
The purpose of recording operations is summarized as follows. It is also necessary to conduct training
and workshops to help farmers to understand the significance of this practice.
-
Review completed operations and incurred costs
-
Determine the level of available resources
-
Facilitate detecting and resolving problems related to rice farming
-
Facilitate understanding of conditions related to production management

(3) Gender and Family Economics Training
Successful family management of income and expenditures is the key to improving the livelihood of
small-scale farmers. Household management should be a joint effort from both husband and wife to
grasp both the amount of annual expenditures and rice production expenses. Training programs that
include gender sensitization and family economics, as shown in the table below, improve the overall
livelihood of smallholder farmers and increase farming productivity given the importance of women's
role in agricultural production. These efforts are also reflected in the activities financed by JICA to
promote Smallholder Horticulture Empowerment & Promotion (SHEP).

Box. Efforts for gender mainstreaming in Tanzania
In sub-Saharan Africa, women play a major role in agricultural work. However, they are often
deprived of agricultural training, extension activities, and decision-making power within
agricultural cooperatives and water users' organizations. Consequently, the projects in Tanzania
were implemented with an important gender perspective. Agricultural technical training sessions
were attended by an equal ratio of men and women. This form of gender training contributed to
improved rice productivity and increased household income. Furthermore, the introduction of
hand-operated weeding machines has not only reduced the burden of weeding works normally
done by women, but has also encouraged men to do weeding works too.

Diversification of cropping system
Given the appropriate farming conditions, a double cropping system can help to increase farm profits
with the optimization of paddy field use by alternating upland rice cropping and with a second
vegetable cropping. The diversification of cropping system presents several advantages: effective use
of the labor force during the off-rice-farming season, increase farm profitability by cultivating other
crops, and adequate measure to prevent crop failures due to sideward waterlogging during rice
flooding period.
In many cases, cash crops are introduced as the second crop to increase profits. Therefore, the choice
of this second crop will depend on its storability, transportability, and consumption demand at harvest
time. Considerations must be given to year-round labor allocation of human resources throughout the
two cropping systems; labor peaks should not be concentrated at one given time.
Preventive measures must also be taken to prevent increased damage by rodents and birds when
cultivating during the off-peak harvest period; the nuisance may increase due to absence of other crops
in the surroundings.
Key points
(1) Crop-Diversification System Patterns
If single-season rice cultivation in the rainy season is the standard cropping system, the following
patterns can be considered for the diversification of cropping systems. Assuming that crop
diversification would increase profitability with yearlong farming activities, the cropping system should
be determined after calculating the income and expenditures.
Rice paddy: double crop (rainy season crop+ dry season crop), sequential crop (rainy season crop +
sequential crop)25
Other crops: upland crop or vegetables after rainy season

25 Sequential crop refers to the second crop grown after the harvest of the first crop, mainly carried out in tropical and subtropical areas.
In some areas, the yield is about 20 - 50% that of rice grown from seedlings.

When considering cropping systems, attention should be paid to the subjects shown in the table
below. Countermeasures for identified challenges from analysis of experiences should also be discussed.
Table 2-38 Factors to be considered for crop diversification system
Subjects
Factors
Cultivation
environment
Is there adequate farming water for dry season cropping?
Are there any drainage problems after the end of the rainy season when cultivating
upland crops and vegetables on the paddy fields?
Funds
Is it possible to purchase agricultural materials for the dry season crops?
Is it possible to repay loans and borrow funds?
Cropping schedule
Is the maturity time of the rice varieties used appropriate (for example, use of precocious
varieties)?
Do the planned planting and harvesting seasons correspond accordingly to the rainy
and dry seasons? Are there problems relating to labor and agricultural machinery
organization?

Project Examples
(1) Double cropping analysis (SEN-03)
In Senegal (SEN-03), the double cropping system was introduced to increase the rice-cropping rate
and farmers’ profitability. The pilot activities carried out put to light the many challenges faced in double
cropping.

Fig 2-35 Identified challenges relating to double cropping system
Source: Prepared by JICA study team based on SEN-03 “Project Progress Report (phase 2)”
The following is a summary of the approach and lessons learnt from the pilot activities carried out in
Project SEN-03.
1) Block management: Paddy field covered by each secondary canal is divided and managed by
blocks. The same varieties are used in each block to facilitate farming and water management.
2) Development of proper irrigation areas: Maintenance and management activities were carried
out by the cooperatives to implement two cropping seasons based on the cultivation plan. Future
challenges include large-scale renovation of existing facilities and infrastructure development.

2-6 Rice Farming Management and Value Chain Development
2-93
3) Double cropping plans:  A "recommended double cropping cultivation calendar" was prepared;
workshops and training were conducted to ensure that rice cultivation preparation works and
farming management would be carried out at the appropriate time.
4) Facilitation of loan repayment procedures (full-year loan): In the past, farmers had to submit
separate bank loan requests required for both rainy and dry seasons. To address this problem, a
new system was introduced in which farmers could submit simultaneous loan applications for two
cropping seasons before the start of the dry season, eliminating the need for loan screening before
the rainy season. This system facilitated the double cropping system in the two seasons.
Nevertheless, communication within the system can be improved in the near future; the farmers
and cooperatives should keep rice millers and financial creditors informed when paddy rice is stored
in warehouses.
(2) Introduction of non-rice crops including ratoon cultivation (Project KEN-01)
In the Mwea Irrigation Scheme (MIS) of Kenya, the official cropping system was 1.5 cropping seasons
of the main cropping season plus hickory crops, but some farmers prefer to earn higher profits by
growing additional horticultural crops after the 1.5 cropping season. Therefore, in Project KEN-01, the
highly profitable farming system was specified to 1) recommend "IRaP (Improved Ratoon Production)"
among 1.5 cropping systems, and 2) introduce horticultural crops to increase profitability.
2-6-2 Marketing
Little information was known of consumers’ expectations of paddy and milled rice quality to help
formulate or commence the projects. Therefore, it was helpful to carry out a data collection survey to
design effective sale strategies with the knowledge of: consumer preferences, quantity and quality of
domestic and imported rice, price fluctuation patterns, existing quality standards and the expected roles
of concerned stakeholders.
When planning and implementing the survey, it is worth bearing in mind that different regions and
markets have different market needs and distribution patterns. For example, as seen in Senegal (SEN-
01 and 03) and rarely anywhere else, broken rice, if completely separated from whole-wheat rice (head

rice), has almost same commercial worth as the latter In northern Ghana, as shown in Fig 2-38,
distribution patterns depend very much on the patriarchal or matriarchal aspect of the farming
household (GHA-05).
Small-scale farmers, targeted in most JICA projects, are generally in a disadvantageous position in
terms of business management with limited output, insufficient technical skills and information access,
being far from the markets. Farmers, with similar challenges like these, can be grouped together to
increase sales output and be trained in efficient technical as well as bargaining skills, thereby providing
them with more favorable business negotiation tools.

Key points
(1) Assessing the quality and standards of unhulled and milled rice required by the market
In Tanzania (TZA-07) and other countries, baseline
surveys and market surveys were conducted amongst
distributors, rice milling companies, market players,
restaurants, and experienced NGOS and organizations.
Other activities include conducting questionnaire surveys
concerning consumer preferences in agricultural trade
fares to promote local rice and, gather prices at given
spots in the markets in Senegal (SEN-01) and trial sales
of milled rice in different package sizes in places
including Cote d’Ivoire (CIV-01).

conducted alongside project partners to initiate technology transfer in the goal of capacity building
and raising awareness.
Box. Adoption of AMTUL model as an analytical method of consumer preference
CIV-01 adopted the AMTUL model, a method that can identify the consumption stages of a
product. AMTUL stands for Awareness, Memory, Trial, Usage, and Loyalty.
This method is considered suitable to evaluate the consumption of rice patterns as it is a product
that is purchased frequently and on a regular basis. While other consumers’ behavior assessment
models like AIDMA are more suitable for one-time product purchase patterns, the AMTUL method,
allows the assessment of "multiple purchases and uses by consumers", quantifying the customer's
purchase level at each stage.
Furthermore, the results of the baseline preference surveys can be reanalyzed using the AMTUL
model by categorizing the questions and comparing the results with the final findings of the
project.

CIV-01 ” Ligne Directrice de l’Approche du Projet and questionnaire survey with ex-project experts in 2020.
(2) Making a marketing strategy
As shown in section (1), a sales strategy can be
formulated based on analysis results. For example, in the
case of Kenya (KEN-01), annual fluctuation prices of
paddy and milled rice are clearly traced, as shown in Fig
2-39, to suggest the advantage of selling properly stored
paddy or milled rice only after March when the prices
rise, instead of immediate post- harvest sales. In other
words, the sale of milled rice in December or paddy rice
in March would increase profit margins by 30% and by
50% if milled rice were to be sold in March. As far as
annual cropping patterns are concerned, the cost-
benefit ratio comparison between "Ratooning in Rainy
season" and "second cropping" shows that the practice
of "double cropping" can increase profits by about 30%.
In TZA-07, the Warehouse Receipt System was
introduced during the marketing training. This system
encourages farmers to have their rice stored in a
warehouse until the appropriate time to sell their crops,
i.e., when price of rice rises. When so, the farmers can
then proceed to retrieve their rice against given receipts to sell. They are free to choose the quantity of
rice to be stored, the timing or the season of the sale of their rice. In a district where the corresponding
training was carried out, it was said that a warehouse and a rice milling station were put up with the
support of the district office. As a result, rice could be stored and sold timely at a favorable price.
It was reported that the farmers in another village (TZA-06) sold their produce during the off-season
at prices 56% to 78% higher than if they had sold their crops immediately after harvest. The perceived

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-96
benefits of this system encourage these farmers to adhere to the rice storage practice as a survival
mode.
On the other hand, the case in Rwanda (RWA-02) clearly showed an important lesson, that inadequate
infrastructures and delays in the collection of paddy by millers hindered the increase in profits.
In Mozambique, the project of MOZ-02 not only showed that the scarcity of local rice could not meet
the high demand in rice, it also put to light the challenges of low milling yields, inadequate milling
quality and high labor costs in post-milling services. The three different ways in which the processing
and marketing of rice by farmer groups like FSG could contribute to farmers' profits are shown in Table
2.1. The calculations of processing and all other labor costs show that farmers who work individually
and sell their rice directly as milled rice at a high price, make less profits than those who sell unhulled
rice to large rice mills. This is due to the high labor costs incurred for sorting and de-stoning the rice
after milling. The farmers can reduce the costs of these services and increase profit margin if they were
to place their orders as a group and not as individuals.

(3) Marketing training
In many projects, much training has been provided to try to bridge the gap between marketing
strategies and the reality on the ground. In some cases, market training also includes conducting
surveys and baseline surveys to assess the current situations and to enhance marketing skills of
beneficiaries as part of the technology transfer process. The following table shows the contents, ideas,
and lessons learned in the marketing training.

(4) Market channel development and trial sales
The type of sales configurations and targeted customers roughly classify sales development efforts
and trial sales into the three following patterns. The supply chain flow, in reality more complex, is
simplified here limiting brokers to distributors, intermediaries and consumers in all forms; restaurants,
retail stores as well as individuals.
Pattern A: Selling of paddy to rice millers and/or distributors by individual farmers
This is a general supply flow prior to the organization of farmer groups. Farmers being exploited by
intermediaries are apparently a common scenario, in production areas situated far from the markets
where the necessary infrastructures like proper roads or storehouses are not available. Nevertheless,
little input is needed to make adequate use of the existing sales system. Some examples are as follows.
-
GHA-04: This project in Ghana newly established a "Rice Quality Improvement Forum" consisting of
farmers, rice milling companies, and intermediaries, etc. It provided farmers with an opportunity to
learn about consumer preferences through rice milling companies and intermediaries, and in return,

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-98
the rice milling companies and intermediaries learnt about farmers' efforts to improve quality. Prior
to the existence of this forum, some farmers made efforts to improve their paddy quality but were
discouraged as their rice was mixed up with those unconscious of consumers’ preference. When the
forum was established, the millers made sure that high-quality rice was filtered from others at the
distribution stage, achieving early sales and high prices.
-
CIV-01: The establishment of a platform in this project in Cote d’Ivoire encouraged active
participation from producers, rice milling companies, distributors, and other stakeholders.
participate proactively. This platform facilitated dialogue and information exchange among all
stakeholders. Training was also organized for rice millers and distributors in quality control and
bookkeeping, and a paddy purchase credit was also made available to rice millers (see the section
on rice millers and distributors in 2-6-4 Financial accessibility). This project resulted in a 78%
increase in the volume of rice purchased by millers and a 74% increase in the volume of milled rice
sold by distributors.
Pattern B: Selling of paddy to rice millers and/or distributors by farmer groups
The advantages of farmers coming together to sell their rice crops collectively include developing
new markets and brands, which an individual farmer with limited output can never have. Collective crop
sales require 1) clear-cut annual production plans (indicating quantity, collection and sales timing) 2)
standardization and verification of varieties and 3) securing necessary farming materials and other
resources (including funds) to achieve production targets. Examples of collective rice selling are as
follows.
-
MDG-01: In Madagascar, seed farmers including individuals or small informal groups, were brought
together at the prefecture or district level to exercise higher negotiation power though collective
marketing, collection and sales. Consequently, a workshop was organized in the project to develop
sales channels, which led to spontaneous publicity amongst the farmers in the surrounding areas
and triggered successful sales to material suppliers in local regular markets and hub cities and to
large consumers in the capital. The total amount of 150 tons of seeds in the 2 prefectures were
completely sold out. The lesson learned from this success revealed that with increased negotiation
power, it is vital to establish norms to maintain cooperation within the farm groups.
-
TZA-06: The Sales Leader (SL) system was
introduced in this project in Tanzania in which
members,
appointed
by
the
farmer
organization, collect information on market
prices and buyers of rice for collective
marketing by the farmer organization.
Allowing farmers to sell their produce at
better prices while reducing the per capita
labor

in
obtaining
market
information and negotiating selling prices is a
big advantage of the SL system, as shown in
Fig 2-40. The success of this system
issubjected to the following key points: (1) the

cost of SL activities should be borne by the farmer organization members to encourage them to
prepare realistic marketing plans and implement marketing activities, and (2) target selling prices
should be set in advance among the farmer organization members. This will not only enable SLs to
facilitate negotiations with buyers, but also reduce the "gambling behavior" of waiting and hoping
for a price increase.
Pattern C: Selling of milled rice to distributors or customers by farmer groups
The collective selling of milled rice to distributors or consumers presents often both high risks and
high returns for farmers' groups. Required conditions: 1) the groups of farmers must be highly
organized, 2) close proximity to markets, namely in the suburbs of cities, 3) well-established
transportation infrastructure network such as roads leading to markets, and 4) a stable production of
paddy and milled rice in both quality and quantity. Inter-farmer group competition for direct sales is
likely to be high with limited number of major customers. Some examples are as follows.
-
MOZ-02 In this project in Mozambique, milled rice was consigned to three grocery stores in local
cities. The sales in two out of the three stores went well while the one in the third shop was hindered
by packaging problems. The packaging was incomplete without mention of the name of producers,
production area, variety, and production year, due to the undermined capacity of the farming
support group (FSG) made up of farmers. Another group of farmers tried direct sales by setting up
a small stand in the downtown area of nearby city. The sale of 76 bags (5 kg/bag) in 4 days was a
success but the labor costs led to higher costs.
-
GHA-05: The training provided in this project in Ghana resulted in increased opportunities for direct
sales to retailers and consumers at higher prices. The farmers themselves promoted the milled rice
to retailers and consumers (by offering free samples) as a mean to appeal the quality of the milled
rice, marking a different way of selling their rice.
-
GHA-04: In this project in Ghana, an application developed by ESCO was introduced as part of its
marketing training. Upon subscription, farmers will obtain vital information like market prices as
well as weather data in 46 major markets across Ghana. They can also be linked to potential buyers
if they register their profile and provide production quantities.
-
MOZ-01: The FSG, established in this project in Mozambique, succeeded in selling their rice, as a
local brand, at a high price to a restaurant in the capital of Maputo. They organized the   milling,
post-milling cleaning and transporting services. Their success was also partly due to their proximity
to the capital; a 4-hour-car-ride on well-maintained roads.

2-6-3 Improving profitability through structural strengthening
One of the measures to better promote the ideas discussed in 2-6-1 Farm planning and management
and 2-6-2 Marketing, would be to encourage organization of famers’ groups and to reinforce their
capacity. Grouped farmers can carry out both joint purchases of agricultural materials and bulk crop
sales, hence enhancing their negotiating power as a purchaser and seller. The appropriate measures to
encourage farmers’ organizations and capacity building vary and depend very much on the presence

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-100
or absence of farmers’ unions or groups and their existing capacities. The examples of measures taken
in this aspect by JICA are shown in the following projects.

Organizational Support
Organization support can be provided if there is an absence of farmer groups or unions.  Water
Users Organization that exist in some cases may not support farming activities in particular. In others,
there may not be special unions that support seed production. The actions taken by JICA in
Mozambique (MOZ-01) are shown below as an example. The activities of the concerned groups have
since continued since the completion of the project a decade ago.
Key points
In Project MOZ-01, the existing water supply unions were initially established under state leadership
uniquely for the management of water distribution in the secondary channel system.  The smallest
water users organization had more than 100 members, making it too large to support farming activities.
The FSG was thus established as a sub-group within the water users organization.
(1) Election of FSG members
In this model, the FSG members were elected by the water organization members.
(2) Mutual Agreement concerning the Role and Objectives of FSG
The following terms were mutually accepted within the groups in the project. 1) The FSG would
support the farming activities within the jurisdiction of the model water users organization 2) the funds
generated from the use of rice milling machines would be used to support farming management and
the earnings made from the demonstration plots would be used for the purchase of faming inputs.
(3) Scope of FSG Activities
In Project MOZ-01, the FSG were put in charge of the activities described in the table. There was
extra-care to improve the transparency of fund management by these groups; verification of accounting
matters were carried out during group meetings. The project proved that these FSG have become self-
reliant because as of today, rice-milling services and microfinance services still operate with generated
revenue for the concerned farmers in the project.

(4) Formalization of FSG statute incorporation
Clauses, drawn from the trials of the above-mentioned activities, were incorporated in the FSG statute
with mutual agreement from the local authorities (SDAE, HICEP) to promote its sustainability and
transparency.
Capacity development of Farmers’ Organizations
Capacity development can be provided to enhance performance of existing farmers’ groups or unions
in the target area. Lack of accounting management skills is a common problem amongst the groups
that need support. Measures taken in some projects in this aspect are as follows.
Key points
(1) Supporting the legal registration of existing farmers’ groups
In CIV-01, JICA assistance was provided to support the transition process of rice producer groups to
cooperative societies “SCOOP” in accordance with cooperative laws. These groups were given
organizational training and simplified notions of up keeping ledgers all sorts of documents like annual
activity plans, financial plans, cultivation plans and milled rice collection ledgers. During the project, 15
groups completed the transition and made profits from their grouped activities (supply of materials
and sales of crops) helped by the use of prepared ledgers. As shown, structuring cooperatives in this
way can be advantageous in terms of better communication, higher credibility in both sales
negotiations and with regard to lenders. Nevertheless, it is important to implement active participatory
management through the management of common ledgers with the aim of making profit as an
organization, and not end the process simply with a formal corporate registration.
(2) Strengthening of existing farmers' unions through training
In RWA-01, a workshop was organized to analyze problems related to organizational management
at key cooperatives. The results showed clearly that the associations shared common problems: lack of
accounting skills, unclear division of roles expected of members, and inadequate management of
cooperatives. Consequently, ToT programs were conducted for district and sectorial dissemination

agents, who in turn, using the cascade method, trained the dissemination members in associations. The

(3) Joint purchasing
One of the effective measures to reduce the investments costs would be the joint purchase of
agricultural materials. This practice was implemented in Senegal (SEN-01) and Madagascar (MDG-01).
1) Selection of suppliers: Preference should be for agro-material suppliers willing to negotiate prices
through bulk purchases; discuss procurement volume, prices, and payment methods to reduce
procurement costs.
2) Quantification of planned purchase volume: Estimate the needed amount of agricultural
materials based on the production plans made by cooperatives prior to joint purchase. In areas
where fertilization is not common, the amount of fertilizers needed may be less than the planned
amount; training in cultivation management is also important.
3) Choice of payment methods: The choice of payment between payment upon receipt or post-
harvest reimbursement to the cooperatives should be made according to the terms laid down by
each cooperative and the situation of each farmer.

Box. Creation of platforms comprising of actors in the local rice value chain
In the Project CIV-01 in Cote d’Ivoire, a platform was created to
allow an exchange of information, problems and solutions
between identified related actors (producers and private
companies) in the two target provinces. For the first time, related
actors in each province had the opportunity to meet up before
and after the rice harvest season. The repeated activities (of
networking forums, market oriented training and seminars)
encouraged spontaneous mutual enthusiasm which resulted in
the conclusion of some contract farming and farm machinery
service contracts between farmer cooperatives and rice millers, leading to the consolidation and
improvement of the entire local rice value chain.
Nevertheless, there were cases where farmers did not comply with the contract terms (namely by
selling rice to non-contracted rice millers or lacked funds to purchase milled rice). Support was given
in the project to help resolve this sort of problems through many ways ; close monitoring of rice
production to crop harvest, training on contract cultivation and establishing a financial mechanism
for rice milling companies (see 2-6-4 Financial accessibility).
Source: CIV-01 “Ligne Directrice de l’Approche du Projet “

2-6-4 Financial accessibility
Often, cultivation techniques could not be put to practice due to the lack of funds to purchase
appropriate agricultural materials. It is also difficult for rice milling and distribution companies to secure
revolving funds to continue their business. As a response to these needs, support provided in the JICA
projects included improving financial access for small-scale farmers and distributors/rice millers
incapable of obtaining credit from private financial institutions.
Target: farmers
Securing the necessary funds for purchasing agricultural materials is a major challenge for farmers in
many cases although the situation varies, depending on the region and the size of the farms. Funds
were provided in the a few projects to help farmers in this aspect. However, care was given in the
following projects to promote financial measures that would help farmers to be independent and to
practice sustainable farming through the cultivation of suitable crops at the appropriate time.
Key points
Pattern A: Establishment of a credit system to purchase agricultural materials based on
collaboration with private financial institutions
In Project CIV-01, a credit system was established with the collaboration of private financial
institutions (COOPEC) and material distributors. The policies and the lessons learnt are as follows.
-
Credit provided was based on cultivation area rather than potential area for cultivation. By defining
the exact dimensions of the farming area, farmers avoided purchasing excess materials.

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-104
-
The farmer transfers cash equivalent to 10% of the credit amount to his account and declares an
equivalent of 30% of collateral goods. The maximum amount of credit (150,000 FCFA/ha) is set
based on the cultivation standards and the calculation of rice crop balance. The interest rate is
10.8% as per COOPEC normal standards.
-
Successful operation of the
credit system was strongly
influenced
by
the
well-
functioning of the farmer’s
groups and cooperatives. If
there were an absence of
water storage facilities or
properly managed irrigation
system, the risk of yield loss
due to water shortage would
have made making repayments difficult.
-
Material credits alone would not be sufficient for technical success. The system would need to be
accompanied by the improvement of production technique, sound organization of farmers, and the
securing of stable markets formed by the functioning of other actors in the value chain.
Pattern B: Establishment of a loan system within the cooperative
In MOZ-02, JICA assistance included the supply of agricultural materials to model farmers who in turn
repaid the cost of agricultural materials to FSG in milled rice or cash after harvesting. To anticipate the
rise in materials prices, model farmers repaid the loans with an additional 10%. The funds from the
repayment were then used as revolving funds to purchase agricultural materials for the next cropping
season establishing a system that supports farmers on a sustainable basis. Given the difficulties in
collaborating with private financial institutions, this option could be a possible way to establish a system
that does not rely on external support, namely loans.
Pattern C: Strengthening business planning capacity
In RWA-01, guidance assistance was provided for the preparation of business plans during the
business plan training (Table 2-43) with the goal of capacity building of organizations. A successful
example would be the business plan submitted by a cooperative (for the construction of a milled rice
storehouse) to SACCO (Saving and Credit Cooperative), which was successfully approved for credit
finance.
Target: Rice millers and distributors
Financial schemes available to associations in charge of rice milling, processing and distribution, as
well as small and medium-sized enterprises are often limited and inappropriate.  Often, the
requirements for collateral and guarantors are more stringent for high-priced loans, namely, for
equipment installation, and loan interest rates are too high for low-profit rice businesses. On the other

Key points
Pattern A: Establishing a credit system for the purchase of paddy rice in collaboration with
private financial institutions
In Project CIV-01, a credit system for the purchase of
paddy rice by rice millers was jointly established with
private financial institutions (ADVANS) with the use of
counterpart funds reserved by the Japanese Grant Aid.
Once (Kennedy Round food support) the credit was
provided, the volume of paddy rice purchased by millers
increased by 70% compared to the previous year,
suggesting that many rice millers did not have sufficient
revolving funds. The conditions and lessons learned from
the system applied in CIV-01 are presented below.
-
Credit contracts were made between ADVANS and rice millers, at a flat interest rate of 5%, for a
loan period of 8 months and with cash repayment as a condition.
-
The choice of rice millers as potential credit users depended on the following factors: 1) installation
of the high-performance rice-milling machines, 2) rice millers' portfolios,3) experience of
partnerships agreed with rice-producing areas for the purchase of paddy rice, 4) management
performance, 5) existence of collateral assets or guarantors.
-
Many rice millers do not have established sales channels. Therefore, their management and
marketing capacity need strengthening. Agents responsible for credit management and activity
monitoring attached to private financial institutions should also be given training on the
peculiarities of rice value chain.
Pattern B: Sustainability in securing revolving funds and investment funds generated by
equipment purchased by the project
In the Project NGA-01 in Nigeria, a survey was conducted to see the availability of private credit
services for the purchase of destoner by micro-fabricators lacking independent funds. As the survey
result indicated the absence of this form of services in the target area, the project adopted a revolving
fund approach; it supplied the equipment. The reimbursement of the costs by the concerned
beneficiaries was reused to invest in new machines. The lessons learned from this approach are as
follows.
-
It helps to put small businesses on track and secures funds to repay loans. For example, providing
free loans for a certain period before charging interests allows identification of problems and
profitability in the actual business activities.
-
There is a need to anticipate different risk factors (poor harvest due to climatic conditions, price
hike of imported equipment like stonewalling machines, etc.)
-
If full repayment during the project period seems difficult, measures may be taken to reduce the
burden of reimbursement by subsidizing the project. This would avoid moral hazard, without
making the beneficiaries bear the full cost.

2-6-5 Value chain development focusing on market needs
In addition to the fundamental factors of rice cultivation, namely, technology development and its
dissemination, it is necessary to take a comprehensive approach that considers the needs of the market
and overlooks the value chain to achieve the goal of further doubling rice production by 2030.
Additional demand may also increase with parts of rice transformed into high-added value products
such as selling mixture of milled chaff and bran for livestock feed by rice millers (MDG-01) rice powder
as a supplement for the Ethiopian staple food “Injera” (ETH-02), in CARD countries. It is important to
develop the rice value chain using these means.
Analysis and Strategies focusing Market Needs
It is fundamentally important to grasp the needs of consumers and markets situated at the end of
the rice value chain as a starting point to develop the entire supply chain. The actors namely, producers,
millers, distributors, and sellers should develop and implement strategies that keep distribution loss to
a minimum and deliver quality products that meet the needs of the market in terms of quantity and
pricing all year round.
Whether alone or in groups, actors at each step of the value chain should analyze consumer
preferences and develop corresponding market strategies as described in section 2-6-2 Marketing.
Based on the preference survey of consumers conducted in Project CIV-01, it was confirmed that local
rice is more popular than imported rice in Cote d’Ivoire, and a particular local rice variety was popular
in both urban and rural area. As a response, the Rice Development Agency (ADERIZ) through its market-
oriented strategy has classified this particular variety as an inspirational variety for promotion. Among
the millers and distributers who have participated in CIV-01 activities, many of them looked for rice
producers of the popular variety and recommended its production to farmers.
Integrated Measures for Value Chain Development
The rice value chain is not limited to direct actors on the vertical line starting from the seed producer
to the retailer. Many side players like financial institutions, inputs suppliers, machine dealers, service
providers, transporters are ready to provide services to the actors on the frontline.  In Project CIV-01,
support was given to tilling service providers, to training programs provided by machine dealers, input
suppliers and to financial institutions that develop financial products.
An action plan to promote local rice was elaborated based on the project results, and presented at
the NRDS2 formulation working week. The project activities not only involved direct counterparts but
all the ADERIZ staff to expand the effect of the project beyond its framework and onto projects financed
by other donors. This was also to install a sense of ownership within the agency after project completion.
These efforts, including the process of trial and error during the project period, are detailed in the
project approach guidelines (CIV-01: “Ligne Directrice de l’Approche du Projet”).

In Project CIV-01, challenges on rice distribution and sales promotion of the value chain were
analyzed from the start (seed production) till its end (retailing). Together with the newly
established Ministry of Rice Promotion and ADERIZ, the project has helped to accelerate
exchange of information and business talks among stakeholders participating on the platform
indicated in Fig 2-41. Development and reinforcement of the rice value chain has also been made

Irrigation
Rice cultivation, which originated in rainfed
lowland, has been improved by irrigation. This is to
stabilize production in the rainy season, make
cultivation possible in the dry season, increase
productivity with high-yielding varieties, and so on.
Fig 2-44 shows that enough irrigation, as well as
high-yielding varieties and high inputs, is necessary
to increase productivity.
Originally, irrigation water was sourced from
rivers/springs using a canal system. However, with
improvement of construction technology, advanced
irrigation systems to utilize water from reservoirs/ponds during droughts, pump water from low water
sources to higher paddy fields, and save water using drip/sprinkler irrigation have been designed and
developed.
It is essential not only to construct irrigation structures, but also to improve the “Operation and
Maintenance (O&M)” of facilities, appropriate water distribution, and fair governance of management
institutions in order to realize sustainable irrigation. Irrigation management was transferred from public
organizations to water users’ organizations in the 1990s. However, successful and sustainable
cases/models of “Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT)” have been very limited.
Table 2-44 presents the major challenges of irrigation in CARD member countries and lists the
typical/recommendable manuals responding to these challenges. Detailed information regarding this
will be provided later.

(Comprehensive Guidelines)

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-110
The first priority of irrigation development is to secure the involvement of the related farmers in the
irrigation system and their ownership, as they are its beneficiaries and operators. The system should be
user-friendly and it should have appropriate cost sharing. This is possible by ensuring the farmers
participate in the process from the planning stage. This is called “Participatory Irrigation Management
(PIM),” which is one of the most important perspectives for irrigation development.
As an overall guideline of irrigation development, TZA-09 has developed and arranged
“Comprehensive Guidelines (CGL),” as indicated in Fig 2-45. In this sub-chapter (2-7), the following key
technical points to be applied in accordance with CGL in irrigation development projects are introduced:
1) basic points on irrigation; 2) construction of facilities (step 9); 3) water users’ organization (step 1s);
4) O&M (steps 2, 3, 4, and 5); and 5) water management (steps 2 and 4).

Key points
(1) Basic points on Irrigation
The principle of irrigation is to
calculate the water requirement for rice
production. As indicated in Fig 2-46,
distributed water together with rainfall
will
be
lost
through
evaporation,
transpiration,
and
percolation
throughout the rice-growing period.
Irrigation water is mainly sourced from
rivers. It is necessary to calculate the
intake water by adding the water losses
from the river to the paddy field, as
shown in Fig 2-47. These losses vary
based on geography, geology, material
(concrete, masonry, or earth), and the
length/condition of canals.
As indicated in Fig 2-48, irrigation
facilities consist of 1) water resources
(dam, spring), 2) intakes (diversion weir,
pump), 3) canals (main, secondary, and
farm ditch), and 4) turnouts. With pump
irrigation, it is necessary to provide spare parts and mechanical maintenance in addition to power
supply. Therefore, if geographic condition allows, gravity irrigation has an advantage, as summarized in
Table 2-2.

where it would naturally be impossible
Sustainably distribute water without any power, if

Disadvantage
Needs spare parts and power because of the
operational pump system requirement
Needs slope with minimum gravity from water
intake to paddy fields

(2) Construction of Facilities
Construction of main irrigation facilities is usually conducted by the government or through donor
assistance. However, it is necessary for farmers to participate in discussions from the planning stage,
because they should apply their ideas in the decision-making process as the beneficiary, user, operator,
and payer after construction is completed.
Even if the irrigation project is supported by the donor community, the government should consider
the necessary involvement of farmers in the project process carefully and seriously to secure their active
participation in the operation of the facilities and management of the irrigation system after completion
of the project.
The contents of main construction management have been summarized in Fig 2-49 by MOZ-01.
The necessary steps for planning, design, and construction (including the agreement process among
stakeholders) are indicated in Fig 2-45. It is essential to confirm the applicable technical
standard/regulations in each country, evaluate the technical ability/quality of the contractor and
supervisor, and follow the procedures of the contract, specification, supervision, inspection, and so forth.

In some countries, participatory construction of small facilities, such as a simple diversion weir and a
secondary/tertiary canal, by utilizing locally available materials has been conducted and it has been
effective in changing the mindset of the benefiting farmers. It was reported that they came to view
these facilities as their own properties (see Box below).
Box. Participatory Construction by Farmers utilizing Local Materials (RWA-01)
The introduction of a diversion weir in the irrigation system served to improve operation and
appropriate water management. RWA-01 conducted training on farmers’ participatory construction
of a simple diversion structure by utilizing locally available material (timbers), which is also a
traditional method in Japan. By this exercise, farmers’ ownership was improved, their participation in
the water users’ organization increased, and O&M and water management activities improved.

2-7 Irrigation
2-113
(3) Establishment and Management of Water Users’ Organizations
It is necessary for the benefiting farmers to trust their own water users’ organization, pay a water fee,
express opinions, and finally, follow the decisions of the organization. In order to achieve this, the
management process of the irrigation system, including water distribution, O&M, training, fee collection,
and accounting by the organization, should be clear for its all members.
In a newly developed irrigation scheme, without experience of organizational irrigation practice, each
farmer should understand the importance/outcomes of irrigation and the necessity of water
management and O&M. It takes more time and effort to realize sustainable and well-organized
irrigation management than to transfer technologies of rice cultivation and/or irrigation.
It is necessary to follow rules and regulations in each country when farmers formulate/establish a
water users’ organization. At the very least, the following information should be provided for consensus
on necessary and appropriate irrigation management among stakeholders:
1.
Area of irrigation, such as benefit area, map, members’ names, location;
2.
Organizational structure, such as committee members, responsibility, selection process;
3.
Rights and duties of members;
4.
Principle of water management, O&M, such as procedure, operator, cost sharing;
5.
Calculation of water fee and procedure of fee-collection; and
6.
Method of managing conflict and penalty.
Box: Essential Characteristics of an Effective Water Users’ Organization
According to Prof. Freeman, it is important to maintain equity among beneficiaries for successful

(4) O&M
First, the owner of the properties, management organization, and cost sharing of O&M should be
confirmed for each structure. The share of responsibility and payment of the national/local government,
the water users’ organization, and individual farmers should be clarified.
As indicated in Table 2-46, O&M consists of 1) structure check, 2) daily repair, 3) periodic repair, 4)
large-scale repair, and 5) disaster rehabilitation. Among these, 1), 2), and 3) are essential. If prompt and
appropriate repair can be performed, most large-scale repair might not be necessary. O&M should be
conducted not only by water users’ organizations, but also by the local community and individual
farmers. This is sometimes more timely and effective. In case of 4) and 5), it is preferable to consult with
the national/local government about technical and financial assistance depending on the
scale/difficulty of the damages.

(5) Water Management
The most important role of the water users’ organization is to deliver 1) the necessary quantity of
water, 2) in a timely manner, 3) fairly to the command area. For this purpose, it is vital to maintain the
facilities well, ensure good governance in the organization, and ensure transparency in sharing
operational rules and their implementation.

2-7 Irrigation
2-115
Box: Rules of Water Distribution (GHA-06, etc.)

When water resources are limited in the
area, it is necessary to adjust, by plot, the
distribution volume of water. Depending on
the irrigation structure system and the local
custom of water use, the flow-sharing
method or the time-sharing method shown
in these figures can be used.

The prerequisite conditions to realize appropriate water management are: 1) to request the required
volume of water (by farmer) to the distributer/operator; 2) to develop a fair/practical water
delivery/allocation plan based on the request; and 3) to formulate a qualified/practical water delivery
system.
Since water resources are limited, it is more important to conduct water management during the
drought period than the ordinary period. During a drought period, it is important to deliver water fairly
in accordance with the rule agreed upon by the water users’ organization. Transparent sharing of
information on available water volume and the water delivery plan is also essential.
Land leveling is one of the most important conditions to realize efficient water use in paddy fields
(Fig 2-50). The same paddy field could have
water shortage in shallow areas and
inundation in deep areas simultaneously.
Water can be saved, the cultivation area can
be expanded, and inundation can be
prevented by land leveling.
In addition to irrigation, drainage is
important for water management. Even
where annual rainfall is limited, local
downpours could occur, and they could
cause floods, inundation, erosion, and
damage
to
facilities/crops.
It
is
recommended to check rainfall records
going back ten years or more in order to
conduct runoff analysis and study necessary
countermeasures.

Examples of project support
(1) Validation of Guidelines and Manuals (TZA-03/09)
CGL (see Fig 2-45) developed by TZA-03/09 have been authorized by the National Irrigation Act and
its regulations. Hence, irrigation development projects in Tanzania should follow the CGL and the CGL
are well known as nation-wide guidelines. It is important to validate the guidelines/manuals developed
by the project as official documents in order to utilize them widely and sustainably.
(2) Collaboration with Third-Country Experts (MOZ-03)
The Mozambican C/P modified and finalized the “O&M Manual (Portuguese)” in June 2014, based
on the draft developed by Vietnamese experts visiting MOZ-03. With the participation of these third-
country experts, whose expertise and cultivation conditions of their own country are similar to those of
the recipient country, the C/P could obtain appropriate and adaptable techniques from them in some
cases.
(3) Widely-applied Knowledge Sharing (TZA-07)
TZA-07 has conducted several training programs on technical information exchange in its project site,
and C/Ps of the JICA irrigation projects in the neighboring countries have been invited to them.
Participants could visit irrigation projects and exchange views/experiences with the person concerned.
JICA has conducted a series of irrigation projects in Tanzania since the 1980s. It is sometimes more
practical and familiar to visit these project sites with a long history and to communicate with local
experts than to receive the same information from Japanese experts in each country.
(4) Recognition of the Advanced Water Users’ Organization (TZA-09)
The National Irrigation Committee of Tanzania is responsible for the monitoring of 32 dissemination
schemes, and it utilizes monitoring sheets for its routine work. At the first Irrigators’ Organization
Competition Workshop held in July 2019, exemplary organizations were awarded based on the above-
mentioned monitoring. It contributes to increase the motivation of irrigators’ organizations, public
awareness about water management, and O&M in irrigation schemes.
(5) Capacity Development of Water Users’ Organizations (MOZ-01)
MOZ-01 has established the “Farming Support Group (FSG)” as a sub-group of the water users’
organization in order to support the farming activities of the organization. In a typical case, the FSG has
gained from management of a demonstration plot, instruction of a farming technique, rice milling, and
direct selling of milled rice. As a result, the organization has also been stimulated. It is difficult for some
organizations to conduct profitable activities because of weak bookkeeping/accounting. However, the
utilization of multi-functional character of the irrigation system, such as fish cultivation and reservoirs
for tourism, should be explored.

(6) Water management in rainfed paddies (GHA-04, SEN-02)
The layouts of bunds and catch canals, as
well as land leveling has been considered for
stabilized rice production and improved
productivity of rainfed paddies (GHA-04).
SEN-02 has conducted training courses using
the
“Secondary
Lowland
Development
Manual (French)” concerning site selection of
rainfed paddies and layout of bunds for
water harvesting (Fig 2-51) for stabilized
production by utilizing limited rainfall.

Mechanization of Rice Cultivation
2-8-1  Mechanization of rice cultivation in sub-Saharan African region
Outline
The purpose of agricultural mechanization is to increase labor and land productivity and to reduce
labor force. Agricultural mechanization promotes quantitative changes, such as expansion of cultivated
land, and brings about qualitative changes, such as development of tillage, land preparation technology,
and thorough pest control work, enabling a proper season of farm work and suitable cropping, which
is important in agricultural work.
There are related factors in the three important pillars that must be kept in mind when promoting
agricultural mechanization. These are "Reduction of agricultural machinery operation costs," "Reduction
of labor force in agricultural works," and "Increase in yield of high-quality products." These elements
are intricately intertwined (Fig 2-52).

Several manual push-type weeders are being developed in the JICA Project. Weeding requires
working long hours with the body bent, over a long period. Farmers have evaluated that by using the
push-type weeder developed by the project, "the labor of weeding has been reduced, and the resulting
free time can be used for housework." Furthermore, since this weeder has a simple structure and its
materials are easily available in the region and village, it can be manufactured and maintained at local

ironworks. This case is consistent with the “Reduction of agricultural machinery operation cost” point in
“Movement to reduce machine usage costs” in Fig 2-52.
On the other hand, it is desirable to introduce a combine harvester with extremely high work capacity
and efficiency in harvesting work because the short period of the optimum harvesting time limits the
working period while requiring an intensive and large labor force. Since the combine harvester is
expensive and has a complicated structure, it is necessary to conduct a feasibility study of all the
elements related to the above-mentioned three pillars and pay attention to the repeated discussions
with the user regarding procurement when introducing the combine harvester.
It is also important to adapt to the local soil conditions, climate conditions, and social conditions in
line with the needs of the farmers when advancing agricultural mechanization. This section summarizes
the direction of mechanization of rice cultivation implemented in each JICA project, in line with the
items "Development and improvement of agricultural machinery," "Promotion of manufacturing /
utilization of agricultural machinery," "Maintenance of agricultural machinery," and "Consideration on
safety of agricultural machinery."
2-8-2 Development and improvement of agricultural machinery
Countries generally import agricultural machinery manufactured overseas, but in some instances,
countries develop and manufacture their own small and relatively simple machinery. It is recommended
because in addition to improving manufacturing technology in the agricultural machinery industry, it
also facilitates maintenance. The mechanization of agriculture is advantageous in terms of meeting the
local conditions because it contributes to the reduction of labor and the improvement of work capacity
in agricultural work. Based on these perspectives, some projects are attempting to develop farm tools
and agricultural machines suitable for the conditions of their respective areas. They conduct field tests
using the farm tools and agricultural machines, and improve them based on the test results. Some
examples of developments and improvements are shown below.
Project case study
(1) Seeder
1) Seeder towed by hand
Mozambique has been developing and improving seeders for direct sowing cultivation in dry fields
for over five years. For general farmers, broadcast seeding was adopted as a conventional sowing
method. In the MOZ-02 project, it was decided that direct sowing should be adopted to obtain high
yield. It was judged that direct sowing would make it possible to reduce the sowing amount, maintain
an appropriate planting density, and manage fertilization and weeding. Therefore, a seeder towed by
hand for direct sowing (PROMPAC seeder) was developed. Sowing tests were conducted with the
PROMPAC seeder. The seeder was not disseminated to farmers because the soil covering chain at the
rear did not function consistently and it was confirmed that the yield decreased because of inadequate
soil covering in some test fields (Photo 2-35).

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-120

Photo 2-35 Seeder developed in Mozambique (PROMPAC Type）
Source: MOZ-02 “Project Completion Report”
In MOZ-04, it was necessary to meet the needs for direct sowing, which can significantly reduce labor
in comparison to transplanting. Therefore, the MOZ-04 project developed an improved version of the
seeder developed in MOZ-02. Since the PROMPAC type seeder has four rows, traction load is heavy,
traveling to poorly leveled areas and storage is laborious, and turning on headland is difficult. In
consideration of these points, the project developed a seeder with the following concept and
production policy.
-
Instead of following the 4-row 2-wheel/soil-covering chain type of the PROMPAC seeder, the
project used a 1-wheel 2-row seeder with a furrow opener. In addition, it was decided that the soil
would be covered with human feet after sowing (Mechanization prioritizing functions that can work).
-
The furrow opener uses reinforcing bars instead of plate type bars to reduce traction load and
improve the process of cutting into the soil in fields with insufficient leveling (The towing load has
been reduced and even one woman can tow the seeder).
-
The materials used are limited to those that can be procured in the city to reduce prices and facilitate
maintenance.
-
The cycle of trial production → field test → problem grasp → improvement was repeated in
developing and improving the seeder, and eight seeders were finally manufactured.
-
The seeders were effectively used in the test field, demonstration field, and communal field. The
cost of manufacturing the seeder was 3,000 MZN, while the PROMPAC machine cost 4,768 MZN to
manufacture.
However, it is necessary for the operator to ensure that two points of the row seeder’s furrow opener
rod and one point of the wheel are constantly in contact with the ground in row sowing work to ensure
the uniform seeding amount of 50 kg / ha. In the towing method, the operator stands in the frame of
the seeder and faces forward (Fig 2-53 A). Therefore, the operator's line of sight does not cover these
three points and seed discharge becomes inconsistent. For this reason, a towing method was
implemented in which the operator stands outside the frame, facing the seeder (Fig 2-53 B). This
ensured the operator’s line of sight would cover the three points, enabling appropriate rowing.

Comparative tests were conducted in the project to confirm the effect of the method of applying a
guide tape (tape to indicate the straight direction) in the direction of the seeder’s path and pulling
along it (Fig 2-53 B). The required amount of labor and number of operator(s), required working hours,
etc., were confirmed for two methods, a forward towing method (without guide tape) in one plot of the
test field (10 m x 25 m) and a backward towing method (using guide tape) in three plots of the test
field. The total number of required hours when using the guide tape (backward towing) was about half
(286.2 minutes) of the total time (495 minutes) required when not using the guide tape (forward towing).
It was judged that this was because the rows to be sown had been clarified using the guide tape and
the rows were straight, which improved work efficiency at the time of soil covering.
(2) Weeder
In the JICA project, several hand-pushed weeders contributing to labor saving and increasing crop
yield have been developed and used. Examples of their development and improvement in each country
are shown below.
1) Development and improvement of weeders in Madagascar
The MDG-01 project is developing and improving paddy field weeders and upland rice weeders. The
shape of the paddy weeder is dependent on the condition of the paddy soil. In conditions wherein the
weeder is easily buried in soft soil, a star-shaped float is attached behind the rotating claws, and when
the soil is hard and efficient weeding is required, two rotating claws are used. In addition, the project
has designed weeders for the inter-row spacing of 20 cm and 15 cm to meet the cultivation conditions
of rice (Photo 2-36).

and farmers. The price of the weeder is 45,000Ar, about twice as much as the 20,000 Ar-commercial
weeder. However, users have evaluated this weeder as lightweight and effective at weeding.
Paddy field development has progressed in the central highlands of Madagascar with the increase in
rural population, and there is almost no room for new paddy fields to be cultivated. Instead, upland rice
cultivation is rapidly increasing. The most important factor in upland rice cultivation is weed control,
and weed control is labor and time intensive. For this reason, the project also manufactured a prototype
weeder for upland rice cultivation. The existing field weeder (Photo 2-37 left) agitates the soil to weed
by rotating the star-shaped gears, but this weeder has problems, such as moist soil easily adhering to
the gears, and in soft soil conditions, it sinks into the soil. The specifications of the upland rice weeder
(Photo 2-37 right) are 12 cm weeding width, 115 cm handle length (attached to the weeding part), and
6 kg weight, assuming an upland rice furrow of 20 cm. One major improvement over the field weeder
is its use of PVC pipes (132 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness) for the weeding section, which
reduces weight and makes it less likely to get wet soil. The performance of the weeder is as follows:
Weeding speed: 1-2 km/hr (including push-pull), work efficiency: 100 h/ha.

Photo 2-37 Upland rice weeder developed in Madagascar
Source：MDG-01 “Rice Productivity Improvement Project in the Central Highland of
Madagascar, “Main Activities and Achievements (Revised edition)“
Upland rice weeders are more than five times more efficient than the simple weeding tool (Angaji)
used locally. It is reported that the cost of workers will be reduced accordingly. Photo 2-38 shows
weeding being conducted using an Angaji and upland rice weeders.

improvement point for the future is indispensable for the development of agricultural machinery
(equipment).

2) Comparison of weeding costs in Kenya
In KEN-01, the costs of the hand-pushed weeder and the powered weeder are compared. The
powered weeder has a working time of 3.5 hours/acre. It requires 1,195K.SH for fuel, carry-in, and
operator costs, and a total of 2,395K.SH, which includes auxiliary weeding by 4 people. On the other
hand, manual weeding requires 5 people x 4 days (20 person-days) for 1 acre of work, which amounts
to 6,000 K.SH. Therefore, it is reported that power weeding is 3,605K.SH cheaper per acre than manual
weeding. Photo 2-39 shows weeding being conducted manually, with hand-pushed weeders, and with
power weeders.

Manufacturing training on small agricultural machinery and farm tools is widely implemented by the
project. There have been reports that through the training, local ironworks and farm tool manufacturers
have facilitated the manufacture and repair of small machinery/tools. Examples of manufacturing small
machinery/tools and utilization promotion of agricultural machinery are listed below.
Project case study
(1) Training for agricultural machinery manufacturing method
In MDG-01, various agricultural machines were developed in cooperation with Indonesian agricultural
machinery experts. In order to disseminate the developed agricultural machinery, local artisans (regional
machinery companies) in the five target prefectures gathered at the Agricultural Mechanization Training
Center
(CFAMA)
to
conduct
manufacturing
training.
Indonesian
experts
and
CFAMA
instructors/engineers conducted the training. They set up the machines to be trained on and solicited
participation through the DRDR (Ministry of Agriculture, Regional and Rural Development Bureau) of
each prefecture. Each training program was conducted with a small group of people (about 10 to 20
people) because only one set of CFAMA machine tools for manufacturing was available, and sufficient
guidance for each person was necessary, along with consideration for safety.

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-124
It is necessary to select a local artisan with the management ability to develop manufacturing and
sales himself or herself for the training. Local artisan trainees learn the following methods:
-
Manufacturing from raw materials (usually using used parts from other machines and appliances).
-
Using blueprints to ensure the same finished product.
Fig 2-54 shows some of the training photos and blueprints provided to trainees.

(2) Training on weeder manufacturing for blacksmiths
In SEN-02, a weeder towed by livestock was used to conduct practical training on manufacturing
weeders for local blacksmiths. This weeder was developed in the SEN-02 project, and many rice farmers
recognize the advantages of this weeder, namely, because the unearthed soil spreads outward, the
structure does not bury rice. To disseminate the developed weeder, 12 blacksmiths living in the three
target areas were trained in manufacturing this weeder for two days, and design drawings of the weeder
were provided to them. During the training, 23 weeders were manufactured; samples were placed at
each blacksmith’s location and distributed to farmers and extension workers (Fig 2-55).

Blacksmiths who have learned manufacturing techniques through the training program have begun
manufacturing agricultural machinery and farm tools in the area, and as a result, agricultural tools are
becoming more widespread in the area. In addition, it is possible for farmers in areas lacking dealer
agents and repair shops to obtain a favorable environment in which repairs can be carried out by the
blacksmiths as local manufacturers.

2-8 Mechanization of Rice Cultivation

(3) Organization of manufacturer/machinery trade union
In MDG-01, using the opportunity of CFAMA staff training for agricultural machinery in Indonesia,
local artisans formed a machinery trade union to improve the quality and promote the use of
agricultural machinery, and formulated a "pilot plan."
The machinery association plans and implements the following activities to promote the production,
quality improvement, and sales of agricultural machinery (Fig 2-56).
-
Strengthening the relationship with CFAMA in agricultural machinery manufacturing training,
inspection, and certification.
-
Building cooperative relationships with CSA (agricultural service organization established in
cooperation with the EU), other donors, and microfinance organizations to improve the quality of
raw materials in agricultural machinery production and secure raw materials.
-
Cooperating with material dealers and farmers regarding the production, sales, and maintenance
of agricultural machinery.
-
Setting up agricultural machinery showrooms for sales promotion.

(4) Training for farmers, extension workers, and machine operators
In CIV-01, training was conducted for agricultural extension workers, farmers, and machine
operators. The training consisted of three modules, namely, “agricultural machinery,” “cultivation
technology,” and “harvesting and post-harvest processing.”
In the Agricultural Machinery section, agricultural mechanization training was conducted for
mechanization staff, agricultural machinery operators, mechanics, and agricultural extension workers
of the Rural Development Support Corporation (ANADER) of the support target sites. In the project,
not only agricultural extension workers, but also leading farmers of support target sites could add to
the “agricultural mechanization,” “rice cultivation technology,” and “harvesting and post-harvest
processing” training by sharing the training results with other farmers. Furthermore, it was pointed out

that the involvement of the private sector is necessary for the sustainable and proper development of
the rice sector.
Since then, private companies engaged in the sales, maintenance, and operator training of
agricultural machinery have participated in training on agricultural mechanization, and the private
sector is promoting its involvement in the rice sector as well. In this way, the training content is being
improved in the project through each stage. In addition, the project announces the following growth
strategies, stating, "Improvement of capacity is not the only way, but cooperation between the parties
(public sector, leaders, and beneficiaries) is important" (Fig 2-57).

2-8-4 Usage pattern of agricultural machinery
Examples of usage patterns of agricultural machinery include private ownership of machinery, joint
purchase/use of machinery, and use of service providers. The status of each usage pattern in the project,
its operation method, and the economic efficiency of agricultural machinery work and the service
providers are shown below.
Project case study
(1) Results of a fact-finding survey on the use of agricultural machinery
In SEN-03, a baseline survey of agricultural machinery was conducted in Dagana and Podor
provinces to understand the current situation of each type of agricultural machinery (tractors,
combine harvesters, and threshing machines). The confirmed contents are as follows.
-
Satisfaction with the operator's driving skills:
60% of vendors and unions responded that their operators possess sufficient driving skills.
-
Responding to a customer or union member's request to rent agricultural machinery:
In Dagana prefecture, 78% of agricultural machinery lenders and 77% of unions, and in Podor
prefecture, 94% of agricultural machinery lenders and 100% of unions responded that “they were
able to respond to agricultural machinery lending orders” and that “they were reasonably satisfied.”

2-8 Mechanization of Rice Cultivation
2-127
-
Causes of agricultural machinery breakdown:
87% of manufacturers/repairers in Dagana prefecture and 78% in Podor prefecture answered that
improper operation by operators was the cause of agricultural machinery failure.
-
Suitability of owned agricultural machinery with local soil conditions:
96% of venders and 90% of unions answered that tractors are "suitable." Moreover, 100% of both
vendors and unions answered that combine harvesters "perform."
-
Availability of spare parts:
Venders and unions face difficulty obtaining spare parts. The main reasons for this are that
compatible products are difficult to obtain in the Senegal River basin area and in Senegal, and
that spare parts are expensive.
These survey results will be used as materials to show the latest progress of agricultural
mechanization in the Senegal River basin area. They will also be used to study the contents of the
training programs and seminars in the project and formulate agricultural mechanization.

(2) Economic efficiency of rice cultivation with agricultural machinery
In SEN-03, farm consolidation, harvesting, and threshing are mechanized. The farmers/producers
bear the necessary costs for mechanization. "Addition of work by agricultural machinery" is effective
in improving the work efficiency of rice cultivation. It is important for farmers/producers to
understand and realize that the improvement in economic efficiency, such as the increase in yield or
the decrease in labor costs, is due to the "addition of work by agricultural machinery."
The project examined the cost of using agricultural machinery in rice cultivation. According to the
calculation of the production cost per ha of rice cultivation (dry season) by SAED (Senegal River Delta
Senegal River Faléme River Basin Development Corporation), the income is 875,000 FCFA with a unit
yield of 7 tons / ha, and the expenditure is 604,822 FCFA. The balance is 270,178 FCFA (Table 2-47).

On the other hand, the items of expenditure for agricultural machinery are included in the items
shown in Table 2-47. For example, according to a survey by PAPRIZ2 (Senegal River Basin Irrigated

Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Techniques
2-128
Rice Productivity Improvement Project), the cost of field maintenance work by tractor is 25,000 FCFA
out of the total 90,000 FCFA.
When implementing mechanization of agricultural work, it is important to make a work plan based
on the cost of using agricultural machinery for the entire rice cultivation process. For example, when
leveling a field with a tractor, it is important to compare and confirm the cost and benefit effect
before determining the benefit of using the tractor. An example of calculating the cost and benefit
effect of field leveling by tractor is shown in the Box below.

In addition, it is essential to analyze the production costs and machine usage costs for agricultural
work to confirm the costs and benefits shown in “BOX. Example of cost and benefit effect calculation
when leveling the field using tractor”. Throughout the project, it will be necessary to collect and
analyze information from government officials, agricultural machinery lenders, unions, farmers, etc.
(3) Service provider and hiring service
1) Service provider training in Senegal
In SEN-03, training was conducted to strengthen the capacity of agricultural machinery service
providers/provider-owned unions in response to the indication that agricultural machinery services
could not be supplied in time and agricultural work could not be carried out according to the
cultivation calendar. It has been reported that the capacity building method for service providers
implemented in the project was a cascade method that repeats the following cycle, and that this
training has improved the effect.
-
Conduct training for contractors and union operators who are well known in the region and
whose work is highly reliable.
-
The trained operator becomes an instructor and trains other operators in the area.
-
Operators who have received training in the area will grow and develop other operators as
instructors.
2) Service provider prices in Kenya
In KEN-01, the service provider price of agricultural machinery shown in Fig 2-58 is listed in the
catalog under the combined name of the project and the Muea Irrigation Business Zone (MIS). In the
case of a reaper, the working time is 4.11 h/acre (10.28 h/ha), the service provider price is Kshs 3,200
/ acre, and in the case of harvesting by hand, the working time is 8 h/acre (20 h/ha). Its price is Kshs
Box. Example of cost and benefit effect calculation when leveling the field using a tractor
It is assumed that the cost of leveling by tractor is the same as the farmland consolidation work
amount (25,000 FCFA). Based on this assumption, the expenditure for field leveling will increase
by 25,000 FCFA. The increase of cost by this work is 4.1% (25,000 / 604,822) of the total rice
cultivation expenditure, and the paddy amount equivalent is 200 kg (25,000/125). This is the same
as the value. If the leveling work leads to an "increase in sales of 200 kg or more per hectare" or
"reduced labor costs over 25,000 FCFA," the income and expenditure will increase and the benefit
effect of leveling can be confirmed.

2-8 Mechanization of Rice Cultivation
2-129
8,000 / acre. In addition, the service provider price of the combine harvester is Kshs 5,000 / acre,
which is lower than the cost of harvesting by hand (Kshs 9,000 / acre).

2-8-5 Maintenance of agricultural machinery
One of the most important aspects of using agricultural machinery is maintenance. Even if a high-
priced machine has been purchased, if it is maintained poorly, the machine may be unusable within a
year. Examples of maintenance statuses in each project are shown below.
Project case study
(1) Strengthening the capabilities of users
1) Maintenance manual for Madagascar
In the MDG-01 project, manufacturing manuals for weeders developed in the project, operation
manuals, etc., were prepared and distributed to facilitate maintenance (Table 2-48).

(2) Strengthening the ability of agents and repairers
As part of the capacity building of machine repairers and service providers, SEN-03 aims to acquire
the knowledge and skills necessary for repairs by strengthening the capacity of agricultural
machinery manufacturing and repair companies in Dagana and Podor provinces. Participants are
informed that the following repair cycle needs to be repeated for the sustainable use of agricultural
machinery, and they are instructed to understand it thoroughly.
-
Prevention of breakdown
-
On-site emergency repair in case of failure
-
Identification of repair contents and arrangement of repair by appropriate judgment
-
Implementation of repair
-
Follow-up after repair
Furthermore, to facilitate access to agents, lists of agricultural machinery manufacturers centered
on Dakar were created. The (1) agent name, (2) main location, (3) contact information, (4) person in
charge, (5) repair system, and (6) other items are listed for the 10 agents. Under "repair system," the
number of mechanics, the number of service cars, the tractor warranty period, the cost of parts
during the warranty period, repair shop details, etc., are described.
If the number of repair contractors training in the project, the training content learned, etc., were
added to this list, information such as “Confirming the technical capabilities and maintenance
reliability of the agent” and “Understanding the level of the agent as a repair technician from the
training content learned” can be confirmed, and it will be more effective as an agent list.
2-8-6 Considerations for the safety of agricultural machinery
Many accidents can occur in the operation of agricultural machinery, such as falling over, being
caught in rotating parts, and being caught in machinery. Accidents related to agricultural work such as
operating an unfamiliar machine, as well as accidents caused by reduced alertness due to familiarity,
are common. The recognition of the risk of accidents will surely increase as agricultural mechanization
progresses. We should understand in advance the types of accidents that occur with tractors, cultivators,
combine harvesters, etc., and provide training on how to avoid accidents.
When developing a machine, it is necessary to consider basic safety measures, such as covering
rotating parts and manufacturing a sufficiently strong machine. In addition, it should be instructed that
a pre-start up inspection of items and an end-of-work inspection of items be routinely included as part
of maintenance.
Project case study
1) Safety measures in Kenya
In the KEN-01 project, “how to handle a tractor in a muddy area” is explained in the manual (Photo
2-40). When entering or operating a tractor in a muddy area, the tractor may be unusable, and when
going over ridges, there is a risk of causing a serious accident due to the tractor falling or rolling over.

2-8 Mechanization of Rice Cultivation
2-131
After confirming the contents of the manual with the tractor owner and the operator, it is necessary
to discuss safe work in muddy areas thoroughly.

2) Movement to acquire international certification in Madagascar
At a meeting attended by 30 staff members, including the Director General of the Agriculture, Civil
Engineering and Machinery Bureau, an Indonesian expert of MDG-01 suggested that CFAMA obtain
an International Certification (ISO) for agricultural machinery in the future. International certification
is considered an important step in improving the quality of agricultural machinery in Senegal and
ensuring the quality of imported products. However, it is very difficult to obtain international
certification, and technical knowledge and experience as well as legal development are necessary.
For these reasons, it seems that it would be difficult for each country to obtain international
certification, and it is conceivable to establish an agricultural machinery testing center that can be
used in CARD member countries. The agricultural machinery testing center would conduct quality
inspections of agricultural machinery, aiming to raise the level of technology for manufacturers,
repairers, agents, etc., in each country. It is necessary to work on obtaining international certification
after understanding the requirements of high-quality agricultural machinery. After understanding the
requirements of high-quality agricultural machinery, when a certification test system for agricultural
machinery is being constructed, it is essential to add equipment for the safety assessment of
agricultural machinery in the test center, establish laws and regulations related to safety, and
incorporate safety standards.

3-1 Structure of Technique Dissemination
3-1
Technique Transfer and Extension
The "Green Revolution" started in Asia in the 1970s. It increased the productivity of rice cultivation
with the use of agricultural materials such as seeds and fertilizers, the development of irrigation
facilities, and the dissemination of techniques. These effects were also seen in some African
countries. However, structural adjustments were subsequently made as a condition for funding
from the IMF and other financial institutions. In the structure adjustment, investment in systems
and the number of systems to promote the expansion of production capacity were reduced.
Additionally, the number of extension workers was significantly reduced as well. Under these
circumstances, the JICA has promoted the dissemination of its technique to farmers by widely
adopting the inter-farmer dissemination approach and the cascade dissemination method, in
addition to transferring the technique to its counterparts (C/P). Moreover, effective public relations
activities were carried out to disseminate rice cultivation technology widely, and efforts were made
to construct a sustainable dissemination system.
3-1
Structure of Technique Dissemination
The structure of technique diffusion can be summarized as follows.
1
Disseminate: The public organization in charge of dissemination in each country will be the
main actor, but there are also cases wherein NGOs and private companies (service providers,
etc.) will be the main disseminators.
2
Disseminated: When individual farmers are targeted, the usual practice is to disseminate the
technique among farmers by supporting key farmers. When farmers’ groups are targeted, the
technology is disseminated to the members through representatives of the organization.
3
Technique disseminated: The technique (see Chapter 2 Rice Cultivation Technique) whose
effect is verified in experiments, research institutes of each country, and the demonstration
farm of the project is utilized.
4
How to disseminate: For the C/P in charge of dissemination, the technique transfer is carried
out through ToT (Training of Trainers) and OJT (On-the-Job Training). For key farmers, follower
farmers, and general farmers, the technology will be disseminated through FFS (Farmer Field
School) and demonstration farms.

Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
3-2

Technique Transfer to Project Partners
It is very important to strengthen the capacity of public organizations responsible for
dissemination and technical development to promote rice cultivation in sub-Saharan Africa. The
JICA project works with the C/P to promote the improvement of problem-solving ability and
ownership of partner countries. Technique transfer is promoted through daily project management
and training.
3-2-1 Organization in charge of dissemination
The dissemination organization plays a major role in spreading rice cultivation techniques to
farmers. In many projects, the organization in charge of dissemination has become the main C/P,
and the technique has been transferred to them. The following table shows the challenges that sub-
Saharan African organizations in charge of dissemination face frequently. The countermeasures for
each problem are also shown.

Technique transfer related to rice cultivation
The technique has been transferred by combining a lecture style in the classroom and a practical
style, such as training in demonstration farms / plots, management of FFS, and monitoring.
(1) Training of trainers (ToT)
Implement ToT for extension workers and related administrative staff. In ToT, students first learn
theory in classroom lectures. In addition, they are provided the opportunity to practice the
techniques learned in demonstration farms and research fields. By doing so, they can acquire skills
smoothly. The level of education varies by region. If the extension workers find it difficult to
calculate the amount of fertilizer required and seeding, calculation exercises should be included as
necessary.
(2) OJT in demonstration farms
When technical guidance is provided to farmers in demonstration farms / plots, their capacity is
strengthened through OJT by extension workers and experts. It is important to acquire more
practical skills through actual extension activities. In addition, in order to promote independent
activities, it is desirable for extension workers to take the lead in activities after the second year.
(3) Conducting comprehension tests
Comprehension tests are conducted to ensure that extension workers who have participated in
ToT or OJT understand the technique. After the comprehension test is completed, each participant
confirms the points that he or she did not understand or misunderstood. Time for questions and
answers is desirable to improve comprehension. Testing at the beginning and end of training can
also be used to measure training effectiveness.

(4) Providing opportunities to reconfirm technique
Providing opportunities for extension workers who have participated in ToT or OJT effectively
reconfirms their skills. In SLE-02, after the monitoring of the rainy season crop was completed,
refreshment training was conducted, and opportunities were provided to explain the basic theory
and important matters again. In RWA-01, extension workers who had participated in ToT repeated
the cycle of practicing and confirming the technique through training for farmers to establish the
techniques.
Technique transfer for extension activities
It is necessary to improve not only cultivation techniques, but also the ability to manage activities
and teach techniques to farmers. Technique transfer for extension activities will be carried out
through the following efforts.
(1) Training for implementation of extension activities
In addition to training on cultivation techniques, training will be provided to implement the
following extension activities. Conduct the necessary training based on the capabilities and scope
of activities of local extension workers.

(2) Preparation of teaching manuals and guidelines
When preparing for the dissemination of teaching manuals and guidelines, it is desirable to
prepare and finalize material with extension workers rather than have it prepared solely by experts.
It is expected that ownership of teaching materials and guidelines will be supported by preparing
them together, and that these will be utilized continuously even after the project is completed.
Examination method to strengthen capacity
Preparing training plans after clarifying the capacity achieved is more effective for strengthening
the capacity of local administrative staff. CUDBAS (Curriculum Development Based on

3-2 Technique Transfer to Project Partners
3-5
Vocational Ability Structure) is used in JICA projects as a method for examining capacity
development measures.
CUDBAS is a method of listing the human resources abilities being aimed for and organizing
them structurally, leading to the development of human resource development curricula,
preparation for training plans, and business improvement. Through the workshops held in NGA-01,
the C/P and the Japanese experts analyzed and shared their ideal abilities from three aspects:
knowledge, skills, and attitudes. They contributed to develop an action plan effectively to acquire
the lacking abilities.
Box. Diversification of dissemination actors
The JICA project aims to strengthen the capacity of
the administrative agencies and staff responsible for
dissemination. However, in many cases, the number of
dissemination staff is insufficient. Considering this
situation, SEN-02 provided training on rice cultivation
techniques not only for extension workers, but also for
animators of local NGOs. As a result, the techniques
were disseminated in the areas covered by the NGOs.
In RWA-02, training was also provided to the "FFS
Facilitator" working at the margins of the project, and the extension workers employed by the
rice farmers’ association. This was in addition to the transfer of technique to the county office,
which is responsible for implementing the agricultural extension project. Consequently, the
construction of a system that can effectively develop the extension activity was advanced.
Therefore, it is important to utilize the actors who have the potential to spread the technique in
the target region actively in order to solve the problem of insufficient extension workers.

3-2-2 Research institutions
Research institutions play a major role in the development and optimization of techniques that
meet diverse cultivation ecologies and socioeconomic conditions, and capacity building of research
institutions is essential for promoting rice cultivation. However, the technical development capacity
of research institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa is low, and there are problems, as shown in Table 3-3.
JICA has been working to strengthen the capacity of research institutions in cooperation with
Japanese universities and research institutions through the SATREPS, which is implemented jointly
with JST.

Strengthening the capacity to conduct research activities
In order to strengthen the capacity to conduct research activities, it is necessary to work on both
tangible factors, such as improvement of the research environment, and intangible factors of
human resource development for researchers.
(1) Improvement of the research environment
As agricultural research institutes in Sub-Saharan Africa often lack sufficient fields and facilities
to conduct research, infrastructure will be developed as necessary. Moreover, there may be
problems in infrastructure development, such as shortage of electricity to operate research
equipment and a lack of water supply facilities to provide clean water. In this case, it is necessary to
plan considering the surrounding context.
(2) Preparing the research plan
The research plan is prepared after determining a research theme (selection of varieties, breeding,
development of cultivation techniques, etc.) for dealing with the technical problems of local farmers.
Guidance on experimental and field design should be provided as necessary to ensure scientific
and realistic research plans.
(3) Conducting research activities
Research activities are conducted based on research plans. In the case of SATREPS and JICA
projects, the capacity of local researchers is usually developed by OJT, in which research is
conducted together with Japanese researchers and experts. In addition, necessary training will be
provided in each research field on statistical analysis, sampling methods, and the usage of various
analytical instruments. There are also cases in which students study at Japanese universities through
the support of SATREPS, etc., in order to obtain doctoral degrees and acquire the latest
technologies.

3-2 Technique Transfer to Project Partners

Photo 3-2 Research activities (left / center: MDG-03, right: UGA-03)

(4) Holding regular debriefings or meetings
Regular briefings or meetings will be held to monitor research progress and share information.
In KEN-02, weekly meetings were held with visiting researchers to report their weekly activities,
share problems and discuss solutions, discuss plans for the next week's activities, share the results
of their research activities with researchers in the two countries, and exchange opinions on
experimental plans, experimental methods, data analysis, etc. This led to improvement in the
research performance and presentation abilities of Kenyan researchers.
(5) Dissemination of research results
Research results will be disseminated through presentations at international and academic
conferences, paper presentations, and the creation of research journals. In ETH-01, the research
results were utilized not only for research papers, but also for the preparation of teaching materials
for dissemination. In order to strengthen the ability of researchers to create teaching materials, the
project prepared "Extension Material Development Guidelines" and promoted the transfer of basic
techniques to create teaching material, such as the types and designs of teaching materials and the
method of taking photographs that can be used for teaching materials for dissemination.
Box. Rice Research for Tailor-name Breeding and Cultivation Technology Development in
Kenya
There is a gap between actual and potential yields in each region. It is difficult to fill the gap in
yield with only uniform technique. It is important to apply techniques focusing on the production
bottlenecks in each rice-producing area. In the SATREPS "Rice Research for Tailor-name Breeding
and Cultivation Technology Development" project conducted in Kenya, development of tailor-
made breeding and cultivation techniques was promoted to cope with abiotic environmental
stressors, such as drought, salt accumulation, cold damage, and low fertility soil. As a result, a
new breed resistant to each stress was developed. In order to advance rice breeding and
cultivation technology development further, a rice variety development plan and a
demonstration manual for improved cultivation technology have been prepared and they are
expected to be utilized after the project is completed.
Strengthening collaboration between research and extension
In order for research institutions to function effectively in promoting rice cultivation, the first
requirement is to identify farmers’ technical needs and develop techniques to meet those needs.
Subsequently, the developed techniques are disseminated to farmers through extension workers.

Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
3-8
It is important to strengthen the capacity of both research institutions and extension agencies.
Some JICA projects have implemented measures to strengthen collaboration between research and
extension. Examples are as follows.
Examples of projects
(1) Application of the Farmers Research Group approach (ETH-01)
The Farmers Research Group (FRG) is an initiative to strengthen collaboration between research
and dissemination practices in Ethiopia, and it develops and improves techniques using FRG’s
approach. The FRG approach is a participatory agricultural research method in which a team of
researchers, a group of farmers, and extension workers collaborate to conduct a study. It has the
following three functions.
i) Incorporating the traditional experience and knowledge of farmers and developing new
techniques or improving existing techniques in accordance with the target areas.
ii) Developing farmers’ capacity to analyze problems and solve them by themselves or further
improving them.
iii) Providing a platform for the parties concerned to cooperate in problem-solving and further
improvement.
The basic steps of the FRG approach established through the implementation of ETH-01 are as
follows:
Table 3-4 Basic steps of the FRG approach
Steps
Activities
(1) Problem (possibility) analysis
(2)
Formation
of
interdisciplinary
research team
(3) Establishment of the farmers’
research group
(4)
Matching
research
subject
candidates with problems
Start with any step (1) - (3). Regardless, it is assumed that the researcher
and the farmer agree on the research theme. Validation of the
proposed test theme will take into account the feasibility of the
technique, consistency with the farming system, economics, social
acceptability, anticipated risks, and the capacity of the research team,
as well as the prioritization of farmers.
(5) Making a research proposal
Based on the above agreement, the researcher makes a proposal.
(6) Networking within the parties
involved
Regarding inputs or the aim for commercialization, the government
encourages participation in research activities by agricultural material
suppliers, cooperatives, traders, etc.
(7) Joint preparation of research plans
All parties concerned (researchers, farmers, and extension workers)
shall prepare a report and agree on their roles and schedules for regular
meetings.
(8) Testing in farmlands
Extension workers and farmers collect data.
(9) M & E
Researchers, extension workers, farmers, and other participants work
together to record activities. Activities will be jointly evaluated by
relevant parties.
(10) Systematization of techniques
Research results are systematized as much as possible in the form of
cultivation standards, etc., and teaching materials are prepared in
addition to research papers.

Researchers”

According to the project completion report, 35.2% of the farmers received direct benefits and
41.8% of the farmers received indirect benefits from the FRG approach conducted in ETH-0126.
Although some farmers acquired skills through the FRG approach, the challenges addressed by the
FRG approach and farmers' needs were not always met. Therefore, technique transfers for the FRG
approach and improvement of researchers' communication skills with farmers continue to be
required.
(2) Strengthening the linkage between research and extension through training of master
trainers (ZMB-02)

Fig 3-2 Strengthening the linkage between research and extension
Source: ZMB-02 “Rice Extension Package”
In ZMB-02, a master trainer (lecturers for extension workers selected from both researchers and
extension workers) was trained. Master trainers were deployed to strengthen the linkage between
research and extension, and their main roles were to: 1) prepare and revise rice extension packages,
2) train extension workers, and 3) monitor activities in follower farmers’ fields. Collaboration
between research and extension has been strengthened through the implementation of the project,
and it is expected to strengthen collaboration further for the development and extension of rice
cultivation techniques for farmers in the future.
(3) Establishment of a system of technical support for dissemination actors by research
institutes (UGA-03)
In UGA-03, there were problems of knowledge and technique not being effectively utilized
because of the lack of coordination among research institutions, extension actors, farmers, and
other related actors. To cope with these problems, research institutions have been promoting the
construction of a system to serve as a technical backstop for extension actors as knowledge banks.
Specifically, the system includes the implementation of a ToT program by research institutions for
extension actors, training for farmers, preparation of extension materials, and production of
excellent seeds essential for extension activities. Through these activities, the National Agricultural
Research Institute of Uganda has provided training to researchers from many regional agricultural

26 ETH-01 “Project Completion Report“

Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
3-10
research and development institutes and extension actors. Furthermore, through the activities
conducted by the project at the demonstration sites (Musea Field School: see pages 3-20),
collaboration between research and extension has been promoted by researchers’ interviewing
farmers about issues and conducting farm field tests.
(4) Implementation of research activities in collaboration with technical cooperation
projects (MDG-03)
In MDG-03, demonstration tests of P-dipping technology (refer to 2-1Overview of Rice
Cultivation, 2-2-3 Planting) have been conducted using key farmers and extension workers of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries in regions targeted for extension by MDG-02. This
research activity is linked to technical cooperation projects from the demonstration test stage, and
information is regularly shared. Collaboration with technical cooperation projects is effective in
disseminating research results over a wide area.

3-3 Dissemination to Farmers

Dissemination to Farmers
In order to promote the dissemination of the technology to farmers, the degree of acceptance of the
technique by farmers and the dissemination of the technique to more farmers are important. The

JICA project.

3-3-1 Adoption of appropriate technique
Even if techniques have been proven effective at a test farmland, farmers may not always accept them.
In order to ensure farmers accept the techniques, it is necessary to consider the following three points:
1) Are they suitable for the needs of farmers? 2) Do they match the knowledge and technical level of
farmers? 3) Are they suitable for their economic ability? Since many farmers are reluctant to change
their conventional method, it is important to meet these three conditions and increase farmers'
awareness while cultivating their satisfaction (realizing improved yield and profitability, etc.) with their
participation in the project.
Adaptability to farmers' needs
As described in Chapter 2, many useful techniques have been identified. However, because of the
diversity of cultivation environments, they cannot be used as uniform technical packages, and they must

Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
3-12
be adapted to the needs of farmers. It is important to conduct a demonstration test in the farmhouse
field to optimize the technique.
(1) Confirmation of farmers’ needs
In order to understand the technical issues faced by farmers, a baseline survey will be conducted in
the target cultivation ecologies.
Table 3-6 Examples of survey items in the baseline survey
Categories
Survey items
General
The cultivation area, cultivated crops and rice varieties, rice production and sales volumes, the
participation of farmer organizations and water use unions, general information on farmers (number
of households, years of education, and non-agricultural income), etc.
Cultivation
ecology
Weather conditions, water environment (for irrigated areas: type of agricultural water used, timing
of water availability, etc.), soil type of the field, presence or absence of levees, location of the field
(obtain GPS location if needed), etc.
Cultivation
technique
Planting calendar, field preparation, planting method, fertility management, weed and pest control,
field water management, and harvesting method
Others
Access to finance, sales methods (where and when to sell), use of agricultural machinery, etc.
In addition to the soil maps of each country, it is also desirable to confirm the nutrient characteristics
of the target fields as necessary by referring to the information provided by FAO 27  and ISRIC
(International Soil Reference and Information Centre) World Soil Information28. This is because in Sub-
Saharan African countries, low soil fertility and nutrient deficiency are also considered factors in low
yield.
(2) Implementation of demonstration tests in farmland
The demonstration test may be carried out in 1) FFS and other demonstration farms, and 2) it is
carried out in farmhouse fields of multiple sites. Compare the conventional cultivation techniques with
the improved cultivation techniques proposed by the project for technologies that require verification
(variety, fertilizer level, seeding rate, etc.).
Adaptability to farmers' knowledge and technical levels
Even if a technique is effective, it will not spread unless farmers can understand and practice it. It is
necessary to adapt the techniques that farmers can accept through the following measures.
(1) Improvement of techniques that are difficult to adopt
Techniques that are difficult to adopt need to be improved to make them acceptable to farmers. In
RWA-01, important technical elements of the techniques for which adoption rate was low (according
to the dissemination survey carried out in the middle of the project) were discussed for improvement
in evaluation workshops carried out in each crop season. When a limiting factor that exceeded the
capacity of the farmers or unions was identified, the focus shifted to switching to alternative techniques
and increasing the adoption rate.

3-3 Dissemination to Farmers
3-13
(2) Presentation of multiple technique packages
Instead of presenting a uniform technical package, the idea is to present multiple technical packages
so that the appropriate technique can be selected based on the scale of farm management and
cultivation environment. MDG-01 proposed a high-yield technical package that optimizes the use of
chemical fertilizers for farmers with relatively large operations and the ability to invest in them. On the
other hand, smallholder farmers with insufficient funds were presented with a technical package that,
as much as possible, does not require external inputs such as chemical fertilizers.
Adaptability to economic capacity
It is important to consider how to introduce appropriate techniques from the following perspectives
and how to conduct extension activities. Countermeasures in case of insufficient funds are described in
"2-6 Rice Farming Management and Value Chain Development."
(1) Provision of inputs for technical introduction
Agricultural inputs needed to test the technique are supported by the project only in the first year. It
is necessary to show a method in which farmers can implement the technique independently from the
next crop by utilizing the profit gained by investing agricultural inputs and produced seeds. It should
be kept in mind that a situation in which agricultural inputs cannot be invested without project support
is not sustainable. Additionally, attention should be paid to the possibility of encouraging farmers'
dependence on support.
(2) Selection and dissemination of techniques that consider cost benefits
As described in "2-6-1 Farm planning and management," it is important to optimize agricultural
investment according to economic capacity. It is necessary to select techniques that will not only
improve yields but also maximize farmers' profits for sustainable dissemination of techniques. Therefore,
income and expenditure should be calculated when introducing techniques.

Box. Technology optimization and dissemination through support for innovators
Rogers' diffusion theory of new technology adoption states that a 2.5% penetration rate is the
transition point from innovative technology adopters (innovator) to early adopters in small
numbers, and that penetration accelerates when penetration exceeds 16%. NGA-01 selected
innovators among potential rice distributors to adopt improved techniques, and supported them
to improve rice quality and profitability through the adoption of improved techniques. As a result
of promoting techniques development (development of prototype -> performance test ->
improvement -> performance test -> improvement -> widespread production) while supporting
innovators, optimizing technology, and taking actual conditions into consideration, many
distributors adopted improved technology. It is possible to apply this approach to the
dissemination of the technique in other fields by determining the innovator who receives the
technique first for the dissemination of the technique.

3-3-2 Dissemination method
Appropriate dissemination methods should be considered in accordance with the conditions and
customs of the target areas. As mentioned above, because of the limited number of extension workers
and activities, the following methods have been practiced to disseminate the techniques to more
farmers: (1) dissemination through FFS, (2) dissemination among farmers through key farmers, and (3)
dissemination through farmers' groups. The following table shows the characteristics of each
dissemination method.

If the dissemination system in the target area is very weak, direct guidance for farmers may be
effective in ensuring the sustainability of the project. However, the extension workers are still the core
dissemination agents in implementing the above-mentioned dissemination method. As described in
"3-2Technique Transfer to Project Partners," capacity development of dissemination agencies remains
an important issue.
Dissemination through FFS
FFS aims to improve farmers' capacity to respond to problems that arise in the field by learning
agricultural techniques for improving productivity. This is done through proactive and participatory

3-3 Dissemination to Farmers
3-15
learning among farmers. FFS will be held in the demonstration farm throughout the cropping season,
and it will be an opportunity to compare between the demonstration farm using recommended
cultivation techniques and a conventional field using conventional techniques to convince farmers of
the usefulness of the recommended cultivation techniques. As FFS also provides opportunities for
extension workers to implement techniques at the field level and aid farmers, it is important for
extension workers (FFS facilitator) from the perspective of capacity building.
What is FFS (Farmer Field School)
FFS, a participatory learning approach developed by FAO, has been used in Southeast Asia
since the 1980s. It is now applied in more than 90 countries worldwide. The emphasis is on the
idea that simply teaching a technical package does not solve farmers' problems, and that it is
important for farmers themselves to strengthen their decision-making capacity to adapt to these
problems.
FFS brings a group of 15 - 25 farmers together regularly to learn about agricultural techniques
through actual farm work and crop observation under an FFS facilitator. The key to success is
said to be the development of FFS master trainers and facilitators, who are expected to have the
ability not to "teach" technique, but to "facilitate" participating farmers. FFS has been used in
various fields in agriculture, including forestry and fisheries industries, and has supported more
than 4 million farmers worldwide.
Source: FAO “Farmer Field School Guidance Document,” 2016

Activity steps
(1) Securing and supporting FFS facilitators
The FAO Farmer Field School Guidance Document lists the following criteria for the selection of FFS
facilitators:
-
have some level of advanced skills, knowledge, and experience in agriculture and be technically
competent for the agro-ecosystem at hand.
-
be available to facilitate the FFS.
-
be able to share experiences and connect well with other community members.
-
have good, participatory ways of working.
-
have at least some reading and writing skills, speak the local language, and live in the local
community.
-
have a dynamic and confident personality.
(2) Considering schedule and venue
Although the number of FFS can vary depending on the country/region, it should be based on the
cultivation schedule (timing of seedling sowing, rice planting, fertilization, pest and weed control, and
harvesting). If necessary, consider holding FFS from when the farming plan is prepared.
Base activities and the demonstration farm are determined based on the following points.

Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
3-16
Cultivation environment: suitable for rice cultivation (water conditions and field improvement),
generally uniform growth.
Location               : good access for farmers and extension workers and easy to observe.
(3) Advance preparation
Before each FFS session, make the following preparations: procurement of necessary materials and
inputs, completion of necessary field preparation, cultivation management (completion of plowing and
puddling in advance, confirmation of growth damage, etc.), and guidance for participants.
In RWA-02, the implementation guidelines for rice cultivation training specify the necessary
preparations and the timing to start preparations before each section is held, and efforts were made to
enable extension workers to hold FFS at an appropriate time (Table 3-8).

follows.
i)
Confirmation of the application of the techniques in each field by the FFS participants in the
previous review.
ii)

(5) M & E
FFS facilitators and extension workers monitor growth and the status of implementation of FFS in the
demonstration farm. At the end of all sessions, participants are asked to evaluate the FFS and compare
the yields of the demonstration farm and conventional fields to determine the effectiveness of the
recommended cultivation techniques. At this time, the expenses required for agricultural inputs are
taken into account, and it is confirmed whether the cultivation technique practiced in FFS was effective
for both yield and profitability.
In order to measure the effectiveness of the extension activities through the project, the following
indicators are monitored and the effectiveness of the activities is evaluated in comparison with the
baseline survey data.
-
Rate of adoption of the recommended rice cultivation techniques (technical item, status of
utilization of technical package, etc.)
-
Yield, planted area, production volume, profit, sales volume, etc.
Box. Monitoring by ICT
Baseline surveys and extension activities have been monitored
using materials such as questionnaires. However, collecting the
questionnaires, labor involved in the information input, risk of
generating errors, etc., are problems. In recent years, the use of
ICT in agriculture has been growing in Sub-Saharan Africa, and
there are some examples of its use in JICA projects. In SLE-02,
smartphones with pre-installed applications were lent to
extension workers every season to conduct baseline surveys and
monitor progress using the applications. Thus, data collection was performed efficiently.

Extension among farmers through key farmers
Technique transfer to key farmers (also known as model farmers) has been carried out in many
projects to spread techniques from key farmers to surroundings farmers. There is also a project to set
up follower farmers to learn skills from key farmers, which adopts a spread structure of key farmers ->
follower farmers -> general farmers.
Activity steps
(1) Selection of key farmers
It is important to select the optimum key farmhouse in the target region. The selection criteria for
key farmers need to be set appropriately depending on local customs and rice cultivation conditions.
The common criteria generally used to select key farmers are shown in the table below.

Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
3-18
Table 3-9 Criteria to select key farmers (example)
Categories
Items to be checked
Characteristics of
farmer
Possess at least some reading and writing skills; suitable ages (set depending on local
conditions); resident of the target area; balance of gender
Ability
Experience of rice cultivation; confirmation of yield and technique levels as needed
Enthusiasm
Willing to teach neighboring farmers and participate in training sessions
Relationship with
surroundings
Approved by the farmers' group (water unions, cooperatives, etc.,) that is the local leader
or representative
(2) Trainings of key farmers
There are two types of training for key farmers. In one, key farmers participate in ToT sessions for
extension workers (direct guidance type), and in the other, extension workers participate in practical
training in FFS and the demonstration field (indirect guidance type). In some projects, direct guidance
is provided to key farmers during phase 1, as well as technical demonstration tests in farmland. When
full-scale extension activities are being carried out in phase 2 and later, indirect guidance may be
adopted.
In addition to training in cultivation techniques, capacity building to play the role of a key farmer is
also required (Table 3-10).

(3) Extension activity based on followers’ farms
By encouraging follower farmers to set up demonstration farms / plots, the method of presenting
recommended cultivation techniques to neighboring farmers is widely adopted. At this time, it is
important to give due consideration to all aspects to ensure that follower farmers can set up a
demonstration farm /plot by implementing the aforementioned training and distributing guidelines. In
addition, necessary agricultural inputs will be distributed to key farmers in order to utilize the
recommended cultivation techniques in the demonstration farm (provision of inputs may be an
incentive to set up the demonstration farm).
In some cases, guidance was provided to five follower farmers and two general farmers by the key
farmers (TZA-02). It is worthwhile to consider presenting concrete numerical targets to the key farmers.

3-3 Dissemination to Farmers
3-19
(4) M & E
It is desirable to establish a system to follow the activities of key farmers through monitoring by
extension workers in the target areas.
[Notes]
It should be kept in mind that if social ties in the target region are weak or technique transfer to key
farmers is inadequate, there is a possibility that the technique may not spread from key farmers to
general farmers.
The study conducted in MDG-03 found that of the 33 farmers who were supported directly by the
farmer trainers in MDG-02, only 3 farmers (secondary communication cluster) voluntarily provided
information to multiple farmers. It was shown that increasing the number in the secondary information
transfer cluster is important for effectively disseminating the technique. In addition, since these farmers
did not fully understand the techniques and their roles, the sites in which the use of agricultural trainers
was not going well were pointed out. Therefore, it is necessary to provide support so that agricultural
trainers can continue their activities in addition to implementing the "Training of key farmers"
mentioned above.
Examples of projects
(1) Extension among farmers (TZA-07)
In Tanzania, JICA has been implementing technical cooperation projects for many years. As a result
of trial and error and improvement, a training package called "Irrigated Rice Farming" was then
established. At the beginning, the package, which had many training days and could provide careful
guidance, was adopted. However, considering cost sustainability, the training package has been
improved as follows, ensuring the quality of training has not reduced.

"follow-up by the instructor" along with "field day" and held a “field day” for neighboring farmers in 31
of 54 districts (57.4%).

Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
3-20
In the first year of TZA-07, a group comprising one key farmer and five follower farmers learned the
technique through joint work in a demonstration farm. In the second year, these farmers instructed
other farmers, and the result was that the average yield of farmers who did not accept direct training
increased from 2.6 t/ha to 3.7 t/ha29.
(2) Musomesa Field School (UGA-03)
UGA-03 pointed out that the adoption rate of the recommended technique was low in prior projects.
Therefore, the project examined a model in which human resources are developed in the community
and the farmers transmit information themselves, and adopted "Musea (the local word for teacher) Field
School (MFS)" as a cascading dissemination method suitable for Uganda. In this system, Ugandan
researchers and extension workers use demonstration sites to support the Musomesa, and the
registered Musomesa disseminates cultivation techniques and excellent seeds to neighboring farmers.
To expand MFS as an excellent model, UGA-03 is conducting activities while keeping the following five
points in mind.
1) Improvement of farmers’ rice cultivation skills: follow-up by a neighboring Musomesa is key,
not just the follow-up by extension workers.
2) Support of agricultural extension workers: provide
participatory
ToT
and
opportunities
for
regular
communication with the research institution.
3) Maintaining motivation without external factors:
provide opportunities to create emotional experiences and
relationships of trust.
4) Increased awareness of Musomesa: PR activities utilizing
existing media such as SNS and radio.
5) Establishment of a system for the continuation and
expansion of MFS: establishment of a system for the
continuation and expansion of MFS and establishment of a training platform to organize the
training activities of each donor and secure funding.
Farmers registered as a Musomesa have taken on a more challenging role as key farmers, achieving
an 85-100% technique adoption rate through MFS on the model site.
Extension utilizing farmers’ groups
Taking advantage of groups and unions and conducting extension activities targeting farmers' groups
and unions is also an effective method of dissemination.

Activities steps
(1) Selection of target farmers’ group
The following table shows criteria for selecting target farmers’ groups. It should be customized
according to local conditions.
Table 3-12 Criteria for selecting target farmers’ groups (example)
Target
Criteria
Accessibility
Demonstration farm / plot to be set up is located in a place easily accessible to
neighboring farmers and groups.
Agroecosystem
Suitable for the cultivation environment of rice (water environment, etc.).
Have potential for increased yield.
Group/Union
Establish group/union decision-making processes.
Have ability to purchase necessary inputs without financial problems.
Can be a model for other groups/unions.
In many cases, extension workers select the farmers’ group. However, RWA-01 adopted a bottom-up
approach in which associations submitted proposals for projects, and target associations were selected
with consideration to respect the associations' independence and willingness to participate in projects.
This was because many associations were established solely for receiving public subsidies or were
unwilling to participate in training. Hence, they had to avoid such associations intentionally. The farmers'
association cooperatives adopted the proposal method and participated actively in the project activities,
and the proposal method was an effective means in the target region.

(2) Technical guidance for the farmers’ group
Technical guidance on cultivation techniques using FFS and the demonstration farm / plot is provided
to representatives of farmers' groups and unions. Provide necessary training for group activities

Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
3-22
(management of activity funds, group purchases, sales, etc.). In RWA-02 in the first year, the project
implemented district support with the C/P in the target district, and after the second year, the C/P
adopted a cycle of indirect support in which the C/P conducts extension activities by utilizing the budget
and human resources of the district office.
(3) Technical guidance for the farmers’ group and union
Although projects do not often intervene directly, representatives of groups that have received
technical guidance will encourage members of groups to spread the technique. Additionally, consider
appropriate dissemination methods in consideration of the activities of the target groups and unions,
such as using demonstration farms as bases for extension activities within groups or putting technical
advisors assigned to unions in charge of extension activities.
(4) M & E
Extension workers monitor the activities of farmers' groups and unions to assess the impact on
farmers' yields and group profitability.

Examples of projects
(1) Continued support for farmers' organizations (FBO) (SLE-02)
FFS, which had been implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture of Sierra Leone, was limited to one
year. In the first year, seeds and fertilizers were provided, and only technique was learned, so it was not
expected that the technique would be established. Therefore, in SLE-02, FFS was conducted for FBO in
the first year to enable learning TP-R in the demonstration farm, and this had an effect. In the second
year, the scale was expanded to a maximum of 1 acre (0.4 ha) in the group field, and rice cultivation
using TP-R was conducted. At that time, seeds (13 kg) and fertilizer (about 110 kg of chemical fertilizer)
were charged to the project, but in the second year, the project planned to have seeds proliferated on
a scale of 100 m2 while providing technical guidance. In the third year, the project planned to obtain
seeds and fertilizer independently and continue applying TP-R. According to an estimate, if the target
TP-R yield of 3 t/ha were to be achieved in one acre in the second year, the required amount of fertilizer
could be purchased by selling less than half the amount of rice harvested. Several FBOs became
independent and continued rice cultivation using TP-R.
(2) Farmers' organizations operating joint fields and securing a revolving fund (MOZ-04)
There were farmhouse organizations in the MOZ-04 that carried out activities such as joint plowing,
joint purchase of materials, joint cultivation, and joint sales using their own fields. The project aims to
disseminate the technique through the management of the joint field, using the joint field and
demonstration farm as a technique extension base in the organization. Thus, this farmhouse
organization can be used as an extension method Farmers participating in joint field work have adopted
several of the project's recommended techniques and they are promoting their use. In addition, all rice
harvested in the joint field belongs to the farmers' organization and it is used to fund the rotation. This
method was devised to contribute to the sustainable management of the farmers' organization.

3-3 Dissemination to Farmers
3-23
Use of extension materials
Extension materials are useful tools for extension workers to transfer technique to farmers. However,
when extension materials are used by extension workers with little experience in guiding rice cultivation
or farmers with low literacy rates, it is necessary to prepare effective extension materials in accordance
with local conditions.
(1) Picture-story show style teaching materials
When extension workers or key farmers with little
experience in providing guidance guide farmers, they are
able to explain the techniques properly by clearly stating
the explanations of each technique and the key points of
the technique on the back of the teaching materials they
use. Such picture-story show teaching materials were
used in several projects, and training on the use of
picture-story shows (CMR-01) was conducted as needed.
(2) Teaching materials that use many local languages, pictures, and photographs
It is effective to use many illustrations and photographs and prepare teaching materials in local
languages to help farmers understand the contents of the teaching materials. Because some farmers
find it difficult to read and write, it is necessary for them to describe how to measure seeds and fertilizers
without complicated calculations. As shown in Fig 3-3, many teaching materials have been prepared to
facilitate understanding.

Fig 3-3 Examples of teaching materials (left: GHA-04, right: MDG-01)
(3) Teaching materials used during practical training
When explaining the technique to a large number of farmers in a field where projectors cannot be
used, it is practical to use teaching materials in the form of posters that can be seen from a distance
and that are durable enough (lamination processing) to be used in a field.
Effective dissemination and public relations activity
In addition to the methods described above, effective dissemination and public relations activities
are important in order to disseminate cultivation techniques and project results to a wide range of non-
Photo 3-6 Training farmers using
picture-story show style (CMR-01)

Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
3-24
target farmers. The following activities have been implemented, and it is desirable to implement
effective activities appropriate to each region.
(4) Study tour and field day
Study tours and field days to visit farmers and farmer
groups supported by the project are also effective as
opportunities for farmers to learn directly from other
farmers. In one case, a farmer's group visiting on a study
tour was able to recognize the merits of forming a union by
directly seeing that the group was carrying out effective
activities by forming a union. Later, this group was also able
to form a union. Therefore, these events, by confirming
practices of other farmers, may lead to voluntary activities.
(5) Improve awareness of projects
Improving project awareness is important to ensure that the results of the project (including
guidelines and manuals) are used by many farmers and related organizations. Project logos, calendars,
T-shirts, project brochures, newsletters, and social networking sites can improve awareness.
(6) Use of radio and television
The use of radio and television is also effective in spreading such techniques widely. For example, in
SEN-02, the recommended rice cultivation techniques were disseminated in the local language through
radio programs covering three regions. Six themes (1: farming plan and cultivation calendar, 2: plowing
and seeding, 3: weed control, 4: fertilization, 5: pest control, 6: harvest and post-harvest treatment) were
broadcasted at the appropriate time, and this method was devised so that information could reach
farmhouses in which the project could not directly provide guidance.
(7) Use of audio-visual materials
Audio-visual teaching materials are also available. MDG-01 hired
actors who played leading roles in a popular comedy film in
Madagascar, and worked with a local film company to produce
visual materials on rice cultivation techniques (20 – 30-minute
feature length and 3 – 5-minute short descriptions of individual
technique). The produced DVDs and VCDs were distributed and
sold. There were about 50,000 full-length editions and 500,000
short editions, and they were utilized as important teaching
materials in Madagascar, where the number of popularization staff
was small. The video is also available on YouTube30. Audio-visual
materials can also be used to supplement the training of extension
workers.

(8) Presenting at agricultural festivals and exhibitions
Senior government officials as well as many stakeholders may attend regular local agricultural
festivals and exhibitions. Therefore, it is effective to present the project results at these events. In
addition to distributing brochures and manuals prepared by the project, packaging and selling rice
produced by the target farmers can demonstrate to consumers and stakeholders that high-quality rice
can be produced by utilizing the technique recommended by the project.
(9) Holding and utilizing events
Project events to promote rice cultivation and existing local events provide opportunities to motivate
farmers. Examples of projects are presented below.
-
Yield contest (MDG-01): The yield contest was held to promote the use of the cultivation
techniques and agricultural machinery developed in the project. Agricultural machines (winnower,
thresher, and weeding machine) developed in the project were offered as prizes for the first, second,
and third place. The purpose of the award was to increase the visibility of the agricultural machines
and make them available to neighboring farmers. The award ceremony was incorporated as part of
the opening of the largest exhibition in the district, reducing the cost of holding the event.
-
Best farmer (GHA-05): In Ghana, the “Best farmer” award is presented every year at Farmers' Day
throughout the country, and activities to promote the project have increased the number of farmers
receiving the award.
(10) Collaborating with development partner
Collaborating with other development partners (international organizations, NGOs, etc.) working in
the target region not only makes the results of the project more widely available, but also improves
awareness of the project. For example, in SLE-02, the JICA project conducted training related to the
operation and maintenance of agricultural machinery provided by the WFP. In UGA-03, the project
cooperated with the UNHCR to carry out ToT for local stakeholders.
(11) Use of JOCV
JICA has dispatched members of JOCV to various
countries, including members related to rice cultivation. In
Uganda, JOCV members participated in the UGA-03 rice
cultivation technical training, and later, activities were
conducted to disseminate the skills they had learned to
farmers in their assigned areas. Follow-up support at the
field level by JOCV members can promote the effective
establishment of a technique.
(12) Implementation of training in Japan and in third
countries
In order to strengthen the capacity of project C/Ps and related staff, JICA has provided training in
Japan and in third countries for many projects. Training in Japan included visits to government offices
and lectures to advance understanding of Japan's promotion policies for rice cultivation, and visits to
rice farmers and other value chain actors to develop human resources to improve productivity and

quality. In third country training (recipients: Philippines, Thailand, Egypt, etc.) and human resource
development in wide-area technique exchanges (accepting trainees from neighboring countries in
Tanzania, Uganda, etc.), participating in technical training in other countries with similar cultivation
environments had the effect of further promoting the understanding of trainees, and it made a
significant contribution to human resource development.

3-4
Establishment
of
a
Sustainable
and
Deployable
Dissemination System
In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of extension workers and funds for activities are often limited.
Therefore, in quite a few cases, extension activities are not continued after the project is completed. In
order for the extension activities to be carried out continuously, it is necessary to take concrete
measures to ensure sustainability. In addition, it is also important to reconfirm the appropriateness of
the technique as necessary, because cultivation environments of areas to which the technique is being
expanded may differ.
3-4-1 Formulation of a dissemination plan
Developing dissemination plans and action plans with the C/P after project completion and
encouraging their reflection in local government policies and plans is an important step in ensuring
sustainability. Dissemination plans and action plans were developed for several projects, taking into
account consistency with existing agricultural policies and NRDS in each country.
Examples of projects
(1) Reflection in district plan (GHA-05)
In GHA-05, "Improve rice extension planning and budgeting capacity" was listed as one of the outputs.
The output of the extension activities carried out in accordance with the "Rice Extension Guidelines"
prepared in phase 1 was explained to the District Agriculture Director, and training on planning and
budgeting was conducted for administrative officials. As a result, the District Agriculture drew up a
District Rice Extension Plan and incorporated rice extension activities into the District Medium-Term
Development Plan. The district government secured government funding, donor funding, and
donations from private inputs through the annual planning and budget process after preparing the rice
dissemination plan, and set up about 150 fields excluding those directly supported by the project.
(2) Formulation of the action plan (MOZ-01/02)
In the Chokwe irrigation scheme, three organizations related to rice cultivation technique
dissemination (SDAE, EAC, and HICEP) formulated an action plan as an independent development plan,
which was approved through a JCC meeting. The follow-up MOZ-02 held regular liaison meetings to
monitor the action plan and continued to support activities by relevant local agencies to ensure
sustainable activities after the completion of the project.
(3) Formulation of the master plan (SEN-03)
The master plan developed through SEN-03 was approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the
implementing agency, National Company for Development and Exploitation of the Senegal River Delta,

3-4 Establishment of a Sustainable and Deployable Dissemination System
3-27
Senegal River, and Faleme Valley Lands (SAED) formulated a medium-term plan based on the master
plan. Based on the master plan, each donor cooperated to promote more orderly rice cultivation.
Furthermore, with the formulation of the master plan as a turning point, the organizational structure at
the headquarters and the branch-level offices were restructured in 2018. Moreover, the roles of
departments and the allocation of personnel were reviewed, and communication between the
headquarters and branch offices became smooth. Thus, understanding the issues facing the host
country and organizing the activities to be implemented to solve them as a master plan in cooperation
with the project will encourage change in the activities of the host country and enhance the ownership
of rice cultivation promotion.
3-4-2 Construction of a general-purpose dissemination system
As the project cannot directly guide all extension workers and farmers when expanding the target
areas, it is important to establish a general-purpose dissemination system that can be widely used.
Examples of projects
(1) Approval and utilization of extension guidelines (SLE-02)
Technical packages and extension guidelines developed in cooperation with the C/P should be
approved as official documents and utilized by the dissemination organization as a whole. Guidelines
developed through JICA operations have been formally endorsed in Sierra Leone, Ghana, Senegal, and
Tanzania.
In Sierra Leone in particular, the developed TP-R has been adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture as
the standard rice cultivation technique for small-scale IVS. In addition, TP-R is actually used in IFAD
projects and it is being promoted. This is due to the ongoing dissemination of information on TP-R
concepts and technical content through various donor meetings, the publication of project newsletters,
and individual donor consultations, as well as the high effectiveness of TP-R (yield increase).
(2) Construction of extension and monitoring system (SEN-03)
Even in cases wherein the extension guidelines are approved, dissemination is left to the
disseminators, without a universal dissemination system. Therefore, in SEN-03, the implementation of
FFS, which is a guidance method for farmers using the dissemination/monitoring sheet, was
summarized as a general-purpose dissemination system in consultation with the local dissemination
organization. In addition, a system in which many extension workers conduct and monitor extension
activities in the same manner was introduced. The dissemination/monitoring sheet is currently being
used in paper form, and the use of ICT is being considered for the future.

Chapter 3 Technique Transfer and Extension
3-28
(3) Strengthening M & E capacity (GHA-05)
Monitoring is an important activity to measure the effect
of a project. However, it is difficult to conduct continuous M
& E unless the administrative officials and extension workers
who conduct monitoring have sufficiently mastered the
methods of data aggregation. GHA-05 listed "Improving M
& E capabilities of Regional Agricultural Department and
District Agricultural Department for rice extension plans" as
one of its outputs. The project has enhanced the capacity of
M & E staff through revisions to M & E tools and training.
Specifically, the tool was changed to one that is easy to use,
in accordance with the Excel usage ability of the staff in
charge. Moreover, practical training was carried out.
3-4-3 Area-wide dissemination of techniques
When the cultivation environment and conditions of the region where the technique is to be
disseminated are different, it is necessary to re-examine whether this technique is appropriate. It is
desirable to conduct demonstration tests in farms, etc., as needed, and to optimize techniques, while
referring to the points for each technique described in Chapter 2 and "3-3-1 Adoption of appropriate
technique." It is also important to select appropriate areas for dissemination because not all areas can
utilize the technique.
Examples of projects
(1) Technical improvements (SLE-02)
TP-R is a technical package for IVS that was established as a result of seven years of technical
development combining the "Agricultural Development Project in Kambia District (2006 – 2009 years)"
and SLE-01. Since the technique was developed based on a vast amount of basic knowledge and data,
no major revision of the technical package has been required for the subsequent dissemination of the
technique. However, when the experiment was carried out by changing the seeding rate per unit area
of the nursery in the field of the farmhouse organization, it was found that the yield did not change
even if the seeding rate was increased to twice of TP-R in the nursery with fertilization. Therefore, it was
decided to increase the seeding density and reduce the seedling area by half after the next cropping.
In addition, because of the influence of heavy rain during the rainy season, the optimum variety varies
depending on the local weather conditions. Hence, it can be seen that even after the technical package
has been developed, the effectiveness of the technique may be re-verified by appropriate field tests. It
is especially important for productivity improvement to analyze optimum varieties and planting time
continuously in rain-fed paddy fields with various cultivation environments.
(2) Need for consideration of target areas for area-wide deployment
In order to apply the technical packages and manuals developed by the project, it is important to
select the appropriate target areas for technique dissemination. In many cases in Sub-Saharan Africa,
the aging of irrigation facilities is a problem in irrigated areas, not only in rain-fed paddy fields, as
described in (1) above. Therefore, the applicability of the technique varies depending on the state of

production infrastructure development. In TZA-07, as it took several years for some farmers to adopt
the recommended rice cultivation techniques because of inadequate irrigation facilities. Around 250
irrigation districts were surveyed and districts with high training potential were selected. In the future,
the technique will be disseminated to selected districts.

4-1 Achieving CARD Phase 2 Targets
4-1
Policy Recommendations
4-1
Achieving CARD Phase 2 Targets
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been conducting cooperative interventions
for local rice promotion in Africa under the Coalition for African Rice Development (CARD) initiative.
By implementing technical cooperation projects, in particular, it has carried out technical transfer
of rice-related technology to counterparts (C/Ps) and stakeholders in recipient countries. According
to the impact evaluation study, JICA’s technical cooperation projects have contributed to achieving
the CARD phase 1 target of “doubling rice production within 10 years”.
Although there has been an increase in rice production in sub-Saharan Africa, both in terms of
area and yield during the CARD phase 1 period, increase of cultivation area is more vital, as
indicated in the figures below. According the CARD Secretariat, while cultivation area has increased
by 1.70 times, yield has increased by only 1.17 times. During this period, self-sufficiency ratio for
rice has not improved, because rice consumption increased more than domestic production.
The phase 2 of CARD, which targets further doubling of rice production during the 2019–2030
period, has now been initiated. Based on expected rice production, cultivation area yield indicated
in National Rice Development Strategy (NRDS) phase 2, it is estimated that the total volume of rice
production would be doubled if cultivation area is increased by 1.13 times and yield by 1.77 times
(Fig 4-1). Since it has become difficult to increase the cultivation area in some countries due to
limited areas for expansion and double cropping with irrigation, it is more important to increase
yield in phase 2 than in phase 1.
Since conditions and strategies for rice production vary from country to country (e.g., some
countries need to increase the cultivation area), each country should implement integrated
programs as indicated in NRDS phase 2. To promote local rice production, it is necessary to
implement practical and efficient measures in accordance with the technologies and examples
described in this manual.

Chapter 4 Policy Recommendations
4-2

Fig 4-1 Contribution of cultivation area and yield to production increase

September 30, 2020”
During phase 2, JICA is planning to support technical cooperation for the CARD initiative. In order
to ensure effective technical cooperation, this manual provides useful technical information using
examples from sub-Saharan Africa to illustrate each stage of the rice value chain.

As indicated above, production can be doubled by increasing the cultivation area and yield.
However, in order to increase yield, which is the main challenge faced in CARD phase 2, the
following technical factors need to be taken into account (see Chapters 2 and 3 for further details):
i.
Improvement of cultivation techniques (paddy, upland);
ii.
Supply of quality seeds

Strengthening of factors affecting the rice value chain
As the above-mentioned eight factors are indispensable to strengthen the rice value chain, it is
necessary to implement all eight factors in order to improve farmers’ motivation on rice production.
In this manual, outlines of techniques, processes of utilization, practical challenges,
countermeasures, techniques, key mechanisms and case studies on each technical factor are
described in detail. Based on this information and the examples provided, readers would be able
to select appropriate techniques for application in their countries.The techniques, including root
techniques in the field, used by all actors and stakeholders, such as producers, millers, distributors,
retailers, input suppliers, financial institutes and service providers, should be improved and
information on them disseminated. However, it is not enough to achieve CARD phase 2 targets. In
addition to the officials, engineers and extension workers collaborating with the main actors, the
government should also carefully examine the following recommendations in order to strengthen
the rice value chain:
Chapter 4 is mainly intended for policymakers and project planners. Depending on the specific
needs and urgency of each country and region, priorities should be set and a road map drawn up,
which should include the achievement of CARD phase 2 targets.

Value Chain Development to Achieve CARD Targets
Market-oriented Value Chain Development (CIV-01): In order to secure more market shares for
local rice than imported rice, it is necessary not only to increase local rice production but also to
supply adequate volumes of quality rice adapted to the needs of consumers/markets throughout
the year at reasonable market prices. In order to achieve this, both individual efforts to develop
techniques and the capacity of each actor, and integrated measures to develop the rice value chain
are necessary. At this moment, a limited number of JICA projects such as CIV-01 has attempted to
tackle this issue, but all CARD phase 2 projects should make a conscious effort to develop the rice
value chain.

Chapter 4 Policy Recommendations
4-4
4-3
Policies and Strategies for Local Rice Promotion
We recommend that project outputs be included when setting policies and strategies in order to
realize long-term policy targets.
4-3-1 Integration of Project Outputs into Policy
1) Contribution of Project Outputs to NRDS (CIV-01, ZMB-02)
In order to conduct rice promotion projects efficiently, it is necessary to exchange information
with the NRDS focal point person, its task force members and donor communities in the recipient
country, with continuous assessment of the projects and their contribution to NRDS throughout
the project period. It is important to present project outputs at the NRDS Working Week during
review, and propose action plans for local rice promotion.
2) Passing Laws for Local Rice Promotion (TZA-03/09)
The Comprehensive Guidelines (CGL), which were developed by TZA-03 and TZA-09, were
recommended for use in Tanzania to implement irrigation development projects by the National
Irrigation Act (2015). It is important to officially validate guidelines and/or manuals developed by
the project so that project outputs can be used widely and sustainably.
3) Institutionalization of Project Activities (CIV-01, UGA-03)
In many cases, outputs and activities of technical cooperation projects were stagnant or had been
transferred to other projects. In order to sustain these projects, it is important that project activities
be institutionalized by assigning these to C/P organizations. In order to solve problems such as
limited staff and capacity, it is recommended that qualified C/P staff be involved in project
implementation during the second half of the project period so as to achieve both technical and
operational knowhow.
4-3-2 Project Implementation in line with Strategy
1) Project Implementation according to Long-term Programs (UGA-01/02)
UGA-01 and UGA-02 were implemented in accordance with “JICA Cooperation Program for Rice
Promotion (2008-2017)” which had been agreed between the Government of Uganda and JICA on
March 6, 2008. In order to implement projects in line with the national policy, it is useful and
effective to conclude a long-term basic agreement among parties and to conduct a series of
projects under the agreed strategic program.
2) Monitoring and Examination of Exit Strategy (BFA-02, GHA-04, MOZ-01)
As an exit strategy of a technical cooperation project, it is recommended that a master plan
covering 10 years after project completion and/or a short/medium/long-term action plan be
developed in cooperation with C/P organization to which project outputs are institutionalized.
Practical follow-up activities should be started based on these plans after project completion. It is

4-3 Policies and Strategies for Local Rice Promotion/4-4 Infrastructure to Support Local Rice Promotion
4-5
more important to conduct monitoring and evaluation of project activities by a third party so that
the plans are not to stale the plans.
3) Periodical Revision of Guidelines and Manuals (RWA-02, TZA-01)
Since the project guidelines and manuals may become ineffective due to changes in social and
natural conditions, these should be revised every 10 years or so. This exercise should be conducted
by the C/P organization to which project activities have been institutionalized. It is important for
the C/P organization to distribute/advertise the products and to inform the related institutions of
the revisions, and provide technical instruction accordingly.
4-4
Infrastructure to Support Local Rice Promotion
Government structure, relations with donor communities and collaboration with the private
sector should be strengthened to support local rice promotion and to implement policy.
4-4-1 Government Structure and Relations with Donor Communities
1) Organization in charge and its Role of Coordinator (CIV-01, GHA-01, RWA-01)
In September 2019, the Government of Cote d’Ivoire established a dedicated ministry for rice
promotion, which is unusual. In general, many actors are involved in the rice value chain, including
seed supply, cultivation, post-harvest, irrigation, mechanization, input, distribution, finance and so
forth. Also, governmental involvement may be at the central or local level, and related to production
or consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to appoint a core organization/institution in each country,
which should be responsible for collecting/sharing all related information among stakeholders and
coordinating necessary action to cover all aspects of technical cooperation.
2) Monitoring and Follow-up (BFA-01, GHA-04)
Since training courses are conducted based on guidelines and manuals, the benefits include
increased productivity and quality, and reduction of post-harvest losses. However, these effects
decrease within a few years after project completion. Therefore, it is important to conduct
quantitative evaluation to monitor effects after the project has been completed. It is also essential
to carry out effective follow-up by the C/P organization entrusted with the project activities
together with the concerned public and private sector entities.
3) Human Resources Development and Management (CIV-01, GHA-02, UGA-03)
Since C/Ps conduct technical transfer activities for 3–5 years together with JICA experts, they have
expert information of project implementation. This practical experience is very useful and important
for the C/P organization to which the project activities have been institutionalized. However,
sometimes C/P personnel are transferred to other departments, or retire from C/P organization
after project completion. In order to utilize these human resources for rice promotion in the country,
C/P organizations are recommended to consider their secondment to the project for training
courses, and to conduct effective personnel management.

Chapter 4 Policy Recommendations
4-6
4) Inheritance of Technology over Generations (TZA-09)
Technology transfer from the qualified staff to younger staff was ensured in Tanzania due to the
retirement of many of the seasoned officials of the National Irrigation Commission and the limited
technical capacity of the younger staff. It is important to maintain technology and knowhow,
develop a system for technology transfer, and sustain the functioning of the organization not only
at the personal level, but also at the institutional level.
5) Coordination and Cooperation among Donor Communities (MOZ-02, NGA-01)
In Nigeria, in cooperation with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)
and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the JICA has promoted the use of false
aluminum bottoms made by sand mold casting for parboilers, which improves the quality of
parboiled rice. In addition to the project team, the JICA office should inform donor communities
not only of project outputs but also of the activities performed to achieve these outputs. This could
lead to wider use of project outputs in the projects of other donors, and to significant outcomes.
4-4-2 Infrastructure Development with the Private Sector
1) Cooperation between Water Users and Rice Producers (KEN-01, MOZ-02)
Most farmers belong to several organizations such as water users’ organization for irrigation,
producers’ organization for inputs, cultivation techniques and sales. However, it is necessary to
arrange agricultural inputs and irrigation water before rice cultivation starts. Therefore, extension
workers should carefully consider collaboration with water users and producers before starting
technical instruction in order to optimize performance.
2) Network of Private Sector Organizations (GHA-02, SEN-01)
In many cases, organizations for water users, producers, rice millers exist separately, and
information exchange among such organizations is very limited. Even though vertical transmission
of knowhow by the national and local governments is encouraged, it is more useful to learn
organizational management and/or practical dairy implementation skills through lateral exchange
of information. In order to accelerate this collaboration, a national or regional federation should be
formed for the exchange of knowhow and technologies within the federation, face common
challenges and submit joint requests to the government.
3) Strengthening Service Providers (MOZ-01, CIV-01)
Although the use of agricultural machinery can lead to the increase of efficiency and productivity,
it is sometimes difficult for ordinary or small-scale farmers to purchase machinery. Therefore, it is
sometimes necessary to take recourse to service providers for tilling, paddling, leveling, harvesting,
etc. However, since service providers are not always experienced in many countries, political,
financial and technical support should be provided by the government, financial institutions and
machine manufacturers.

4-4 Infrastructure to Support Local Rice Promotion/4-5 Development of a Technology-based System
4-7
4) Cooperation and Coordination with Volunteers (UGA-03, ZMB-01)
There has been technology transfer on rice cultivation to volunteers as part of the project in some
countries, such as the training courses organized for the Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers
(JOCV) in Uganda, and for both the JOCV and the US Peace Corps in Zambia. These organizations
have closely worked with farmers in the agricultural community and conducted continuous follow-
up activities. Collaboration with volunteers should complement activities by the government and
projects.
5) Cooperation and Coordination with NGOs (SLE-01, SEN-02)
In Sierra Leone, staff of international NGOs which had been conducting technical support in areas
such as rice cultivation, seed production/certification, marshland development, chicken farming,
were invited to training. These NGOs introduced training techniques into their own training course.
In Senegal, training of local NGOs is a project indicator, since collaboration with NGOs was taken
into account. In case of limited human resources for project implementation, such as extension
workers, collaboration with international and/or local NGOs should be considered.

4-5
Development of a Technology-based System
The use of technology to improve cultivation techniques, especially the seed supply system, is
recommended.
4-5-1 Development of a Seed Supply System
1) Development of a Quality Seed Supply System (GHA-06, MOZ-03, SEN-03)
Rice producers should be able to choose their preferred variety and the volume of rice seed
required based on market needs, and to negotiate purchase volumes and prices with seed suppliers.
Also, in case of certified seeds, both producers and seed suppliers should have a stable system of
supply and demand. The government is requested to provide appropriate information and support
for the seed market in order to ensure fair negotiation and cooperation.
2) Practical Support for Quality Seed Production (CIV-01, CMR-02, SEN-02)
In Cameroon, CMR-02 has conducted activities for sustainable quality seed production in order
to strengthen capacity of farmers/farmers’ groups and to set up a sustainable seed supply system.
The government has tried to develop seed production capacity of core farmers and to improve the
seed supply network in order to increase rice production. Where a national rice seed supply network
does not exist, the above-mentioned practical and simple seed supply system should be established.
3) Provision of a Quality Seed Inspection System (BFA-01)
The number and quality of seed inspectors is limited in CARD member countries. In addition to
requesting member countries to provide a sufficient number of inspectors, capacity development

Chapter 4 Policy Recommendations
4-8
of seed inspectors should also be considered. Also, inspection equipment and their operational
costs should be provided.
4-5-2 Basic Systems for the support of Local Rice Promotion
1) Development of a Statistic Information System (UGA-02)
One of the biggest challenges faced by many CARD member countries concerns the collection
of accurate and useful data on the rice value chain, including the provision and revision of
agricultural statistics on production, productivity, distribution, consumption volume and actual
conditions of rice stakeholders, for policy formulation and monitoring purposes. Since reliable
statistical data are essential for policy making, the development of a better system of
collecting/analyzing data on rice value chain should be a long-term aim of the government; this
can be done in collaboration with international organizations such as the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and AfricaRice.
2) Introduction of Agricultural Insurance as Resilience Measure (Ethiopia)
Draught and flood risks have recently increased due to climate change. As part of resilience
management, the promotion of index-based crop insurance has been studied in Ethiopia for rural
resilience enhancement 31. In addition, AfriceRice has supported sustainable business for rice
producers by providing a shared platform32 and agricultural insurance. Resilience enhancement
should be tailored to the specific requirements of each area.

Policy
Implementation
Close collaboration regarding budgetary matters and subsidies between the private and public
sectors is recommended for policy implementation.
4-6-1 Government Budgets
1) Evidence-based Budget Proposals (GHA-05, TZA-09)
Despite budgetary restrictions, each country has implemented measures to provide C/P funding
for the project in accordance with R/D. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has made this
more difficult and some countries were not able to provide necessary operational costs for project
activities. Therefore, C/P organization should submit realistic budget proposals based not only on
international R/D but also on concrete and quantitative evidence indicating increase of rice
production and farmers’ incomes, indirect contributions to stakeholders, increase in tax revenues,

in-africa/

4-6 Financial Support and Subsidies for Policy Implementation
4-9
decrease in foreign currency required to import rice and reduction of government subsidies. It is
also important to secure necessary budget even after project completion.
2) Support for the Purchase of Agricultural Machinery (CIV-01, GHA-06, SEN-01)
Even though some countries offer tax reductions for the import of agricultural machinery, this is
not taken advantage of in most case as it involves complicated procedures. In order to promote
and modernize rice production activities, machines for cultivation, harvesting, threshing, and milling
are required. Integrated support for the purchase of machinery should be considered, including
public support such as subsidies/financing, and private support such as credits/loans, in addition
to tax reduction.
3) Power Supply for Agricultural Activities (GHA-01)
As mentioned above, gravity irrigation is generally preferred; however, pump irrigation should
be adopted if the paddy field is above river level, in which case, power or fuel is necessary. This
could be a heavy burden for water users’ organizations and/or the government, and reasonable
and sustainable solutions such as solar panels should be considered in such cases. In Japan,
reasonably priced electricity is provided for agricultural use. In CARD member countries, this should
be seriously considered for agricultural activities by water users and/or producer organizations.
4-6-2 Collaboration with the Private Sector
1) Cost Sharing for Irrigation Development (GHA-06, TZA-09)
Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of irrigation facilities designed and constructed for the
project site should be ensured in order to distribute irrigation water equally and efficiently. The
relevant organizations should be placed in charge to manage depending on the function and size
of the structures required to connect water resources to the paddy field. Main facilities are run by
the government, while field facilities are maintained by the farmers’ organizations. Agreed
operation and water management procedures in accordance with regulations should be applied.
2) Provision of Private Financial Products (CIV-01, GHA-06)
Quality seeds and fertilizers, and appropriate pesticides are required for cultivation. However,
since many farmers have limited money, the purchase of agricultural inputs in appropriate volume
and timing is difficult. In Cote d’Ivoire, the close relationship between the rate of implementing
cultivation techniques and provision of agricultural inputs was examined. Also, adequate financing
is necessary to recruit service providers for tilling, harvesting and so on. Therefore, the relevant
organizations should collaborate with private financial institutions, and develop financial products
for farmers, millers and distributors in order to support/accelerate economic activities throughout
the rice value chain.

Chapter 4 Policy Recommendations
4-10
4-7
Research into and Extension of Wide-area Expansion
The development and improvement of research facilities and organizations for the extension of
wide-area expansion is recommended.
4-7-1 Development of Specialized Institutions
1) Strengthening Regional Cooperation (TZA-04, UGA-03, CMR-02)
The Kilimanjaro Agricultural Training Centre (KATC) is an example of an institution specializing in
technical cooperation; the government of Tanzania and JICA have conducted a series of rice
promotion projects for more than 40 years at the center. Many practical training courses have been
organized for domestic trainees from the entire country, as well as courses for governmental
officials of neighboring countries such as Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, and Uganda. In addition to KATC,
the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in Uganda and the Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development (MINADER) in Cameroon might be one of possible candidate institutions.
Regional activities on technology/information sharing in CARD member countries, including West
Africa should be arranged. Various measures concerning regional cooperation such as dispatching
staff to other member countries for technical and operational training are also worth consideration.
2) Development of the Extension System (UGA-03)
Although the number of extension workers in Uganda has been reduced and restricted,
recruitment of extension workers at the district level has been initiated. Newly appointed staff
should be trained through a Training of Trainers (ToT) scheme and/or provided refresher training
so that they can acquire basic and practical knowledge/capacity to use the technical package
developed by the project. Other countries have recruited officials and introduced a new extension
system to supplement limited staff by utilizing Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
and others resources despite limited finances.
3) Development of a Research System (KEN-02, UGA-02)
In Uganda, the need to improve research capacity was identified as an urgent issue to ensure
project sustainability, and the recruitment of researchers, research assistants and research
coordinators, was therefore emphasized. In order to improve the capacity of researchers, research
infrastructure/materials have been developed through international joint research programs in
Kenya, which is expected to become a regional hub for researchers. Adequate financing is also
required for research; “Agricultural Technology and Agribusiness Advisory Service Project”
comprising technology development and agricultural research has thus been conducted as a
priority national project in Uganda. It is important to provide appropriate institutional, human and
financial environment to sustain rice research activities.

4-7 Research into and Extension of Wide-area Expansion
4-11
4-7-2 Appropriate Extension Methodologies
1) Research and Extension based on Farmers’ Needs (ETH-01, MOZ-02, ZMB-02)
In Ethiopia, participatory agricultural research by the Farmer Research Group (FRG) has been
conducted to develop appropriate procedures and countermeasures to challenges faced by farmers,
and this has produced positive outputs. In Mozambique, collaboration between farmers and
research/extension organizations has been carried out in order to study the problems and needs
of farmers. In Zambia, the relationship between the research institute and the extension office has
been reinforced; the national research institute has been used not only for rice research but also
for training courses on rice cultivation. As the promotion of research and collaboration between
research and extension are common challenges in CARD member countries, a national coordination
body in each country should be established to accelerate responsible collaboration.
2) Dissemination/Utilization of Demonstration Plots (GHA-06)
Verification/training/demonstration plots should use to verify the effects of the project and
accelerate extension. In Ghana, demonstration plots have been considered as an extension platform
for public-private-partnership, with minimal cost even after project completion as part of the
irrigation fee is used for the purpose.
3) Rational Selection of Core Farmers (GHA-06)
JICA experts and C/P have selected key farmers for technical transfer in the field of extension. It
is important to select persons with sufficient knowledge and significant influence in the local
community who have received training to disseminate knowhow, and not to automatically restrict
the choice to community leaders.
4) Increasing Motivation among Farmers (BFA-02)
To ensure good outcomes of extension activities, it is important to motivate farmers to participate
in training courses in order to sustain their motivation. Increased production and improved living
standards are obvious and clear indicators of good results, and these encourage farmers to
participate in the project and to utilize project outputs. Thus, in addition to training, on the field,
real-life experience with countable outcomes in demonstration plots, constant practice by farmers
at their own field and effective monitoring/follow-up by project staff are important.
