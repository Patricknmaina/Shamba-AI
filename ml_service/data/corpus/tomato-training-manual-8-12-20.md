Foreword
Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Project (KCSAP) tasked the Kenya Agricultural &
Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) with the implementation of the project
Component 2, on  ‘Strengthening Climate-Smart Agricultural Research and Seed Systems’.
The component activities are geared towards the development, validation, adoption and
delivery of context specific climate smart agriculture (CSA) technologies, innovation and
management practices (TIMPS). The other  responsibility was development of sustainable
seed production and distribution systems for priority value chains  to enhance availability
and access to seed, breeds and fingerlings by target beneficiaries under Components 1 (Up
scaling Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices). Against this background, KALRO and her
NARS partners have developed, validated and availed CSA TIMPS for dissemination and
adoption.  The TIMPS have further been unpacked during the development of Training of
Trainers (ToT) Manuals for use in training public and private extension service providers
and lead farmers.
The ToT Manuals are instructional guides to be used for teaching and learning step-by-
step procedures of implementing CSA innovations for each of the 13 value chains being
addressed. The training content is drawn from the CSA TIMPS that support respective value
chains. The content are arranged in progressive modules supported by extensive information
from research information and background data drawn from the TIMPS. Their relevance
are based on the needs teased out of the value chains and the project objectives. The ToT
Manuals training design takes into consideration the delivery system, the partners and their
roles, the duration of training and logical flow of the sessions. Similar content requiring
similar delivery systems are grouped together while the roles of the partners are tapped in
the training and planning of the training sessions.
The Manual is divided into modules, which have a uniform outline that ensures every aspect
of the TIMPs are fully covered in way that the trainees can absorb and relate to. Various
delivery methods are deployed and where possible demonstrations and practical work
are incorporated to enable the trainees learn by participating in the actual field activities.
Furthermore, to ensure that the training across various groups is standardized, trainers
guidelines, detailed descriptions of the trainees, program, training methods and a training
evaluation have been provided in the manual. Adhering to these guidelines, therefore, enables
possibility to replicate the training in several locations without loss of details regardless of
whether conducted by different trainers.
It is highly advised that the ToT Manuals should be used in conjunction with the respective
value chains’ TIMPs documents and facts sheets in order to provide valuable resource for
both public and private extension service providers. The use of this Manual is expected
to spur increased productivity and resilience by farmers, while mitigating climate change

impacts in the value chains to deliver the envisaged ‘Triple Wins’.
I am greatly indebted to the value chain leaders and all those who participated in the
preparation of the Manual, which is expected to herald a new way of delivering training
content in a changing agricultural environment.

Preface
The Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Project (KCSAP) is a Government of Kenya project
with support from both the World Bank and the government. It is a five-year project imple­
mented in 24 counties, mainly in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), at a cost of Ksh.
25B. The project development objective (PDO) is “to increase agricultural productivity and
build resilience to climate change risks in the targeted smallholder farming and pastoral
communities, and in the event of an Eligible Crisis or Emergency, to provide immediate and
effective response.” This objective is to be achieved through the implementation of five key
components, which are 1) Up scaling Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices, 2) Strengthen­
ing Climate-Smart Agricultural Research and Seed Systems, 3) Supporting Agro-weather,
Market, Climate, and Advisory Services, 4) Project Coordination and Management and 5)
Contingency Emergency Response.
Component 1 involves facilitating the empowering of farmers and communities to adopt
technologies, innovations and management practices (TIMPs) to achieve the Climate Smart
Agriculture (CSA) triple-wins of; increased productivity, enhanced resilience (adaptation),
and reduced Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (mitigation). Component 2 is charged with
the responsibility of providing the TIMPs. Therefore, it supports the development, valida­
tion, and adoption of context specific CSA TIMPS to target beneficiaries under Components
1 and 3 as well as development of sustainable seed production and distribution systems.

To catalyze uptake of TIMPs, Kenya Agricultural & Livestock Research Organization (KAL­
RO) in conjunction with partners in the National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) and
Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) compiled inventories
of TIMPs for each of the 13 prioritized value chains (cassava, green grams, sorghum, millet,
pigeon peas, bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, apiculture, indigenous chicken (meat and eggs),
dairy (cattle and camel), red meat (cattle, sheep and goats) and aquaculture and 3 cross cut­
ting value chains (natural resource management, pastures and fodder and animal health).
The TIMPs were categorized into those ready for upscaling, those that needed validation and
gaps that required further research. Training of Trainers’ (ToT) manuals focusing on TIMPs
that are ready upscaling for each of the value chains were subsequently developed and form
the basis of training county extension staff, service providers and lead farmers. They are in
turn expected to cascade this training to beneficiaries in the targeted smallholder farming,
agro-pastral and pastoral communities in the 24 project counties of Marsabit, Isiolo, Tana
River, Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, West Pokot, Baringo, Laikipia, Machakos, Nyeri, Tharaka
Nithi, Lamu, Taita Taveta, Kajiado, Busia, Siaya, Nyandarua, Bomet, Kericho, Kakamega,
Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet and Kisumu.
KALRO having the mandate of implementing of activities under Component 2, has been
instrumental in using its information resources and those of partners and collaborators to
come up with the inventories of TIMPs and corresponding ToT Manuals. The use of these
information resources coupled with the accompanying training and the contribution of the
other project components, will go a long way in enabling the KCSAP to meet its develop­
ment objective.

The National Project Coordination Unit is grateful to all who participated in the develop­
ment and production of this Training of Trainers Manual for Climate Smart Agricultural
Technologies, Innovations and Management Practices for Tomato Value Chain. It is my
hope that counties and other users will put this resource to good use as they transform and
reorient their agricultural systems to make them more productive and resilient while mini­
mizing GHG emissions under the new realities of a changing climate.

SECTION 1: BACKGROUND
1.1
Importance of the Tomato Value Chain in the Kenyan Economy
Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is one of the most important vegetables grown for income
and consumption in Kenya.  It is high in nutraceutical value and is utilized fresh in salads or
cooked in many local dishes and can also be processed to a range of value added products.
Tomato have significant nutritional value. In recent years, they have become known as an
important source of lycopene, which is a powerful antioxidant that acts as an anti-carcinogen.
Tomato accounted for 38.1 percent by value of the exotic vegetables marketed in 2018 and
was produced in an area of 28,263 ha with an output of 574,458 tons valued at KES 19.9
billion (HDC, 2019). Tomato production has potential for commercialization by small-holder
farmers and other chain actors across the gender divide. There has been an upsurge in tomato
production trends over the years which can be attributed to increased volumes and better
farm gate prices in the main producing counties which include Kirinyaga, Kajiado, Taita-
Taveta, Laikipia, Bungoma, and Trans-Nzoia, among others. This increase in production
may be attributed to enhanced irrigation in open field cultivation, expansion in greenhouse
production and spread of production in new areas.
However, various constraints hamper tomato production. The prevalence of tomato leaf
miner, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), an important pest in tomato production, bacterial wilt and
late blight are the major challenges faced by tomato farmers. Other pests and diseases that
constrain production include whiteflies, borers, Fusarium wilt, tomato spotted wilt virus,
tomato yellow leaf curl virus and root-knot nematode. Factors such as lack of appropriate
varieties for specific zones tolerant to biotic and abiotic stresses, poor agronomic practices
(nutrient management and water use efficiency), physiological disorders (blossom end rot,
sun-scald) and high postharvest losses also constrain tomato production. These challenges
coupled with lack of value addition and marketing issues affect the profitability of tomato
production. Development and promotion of climate smart technologies is the most effective
strategy to address the prevalent constraints in order to improve performance the tomato
value chain.
1.2
Objectives of the Manual
The purpose of this manual is to provide farmer trainers/trainers with knowledge and skills
on how to facilitate and support farmer field and business schools (FFBS) for increased
productivity through adoption of good agricultural practices (GAP). Specifically, the
objectives of this training are:
1.	 Provide farmer’s trainers with relevant altitude, knowledge and skill in tomato
farming as a business and market assessment techniques for market led production
2.	 Refresh farmer trainers’/trainers’ knowledge and skills in Tomato GAP including
choice of appropriate varieties, clean seedling production and management of
tomato crop in open field and greenhouse
3.	 Provide farmers trainers/trainers with knowledge and skills in value addition at
individual or group level as post-harvest tomato management

2
4.	 Provide farmer trainers with knowledge and skills in participatory techniques
for effective facilitation of adult learning processes through FFBS’s and develop
inclusive stakeholder partnerships for sustainable up scaling of FFBS.
After the training, the farmer trainers/trainers will train Lead Farmers (LFs) for a season
long FFBS session on tomato GAPs. The FFBS training will involve providing the LF with
techniques in participatory preparation, mobilization, planning, implementation, monitoring
and evaluation of FFBS sessions. The lead farmers shall thereafter upscale the adoption of
GAPs through farmer led FFBS, in their villages and those in neighbourhood.
1.3

1.1
Orientation of the Modules
The first part of this manual is about the training content or modules. It outlines the orientation
and outline of the 15 modules which have a total of 4 sessions. The 15 modules cover GAPs in
tomato value chain. The 15 modules are orientated so as to ensure CSA is adopted to improve
productivity through improved Tomato value chain competitiveness in a market led production.
During the Trainig Needs Assessment (TNA), farmers’ priority needs in knowledge were:
Tomato varieties with desired attributes e.g. tolerance to heat stress, good agronomic
practices, soil nutrition and water management, pest and disease management, postharvest,
value addition and marketing issues for increased productivity and commercialization.

SECTION 3: TRAINING DESIGN
3.1
Delivery System
The delivery system designed for this training consists of two stages:
3.1.1
Establishment of a team of trainers
•
A Core Team of Trainers (CTT) trains farmer trainers as trainers in a 6 days ToT
course. This is done using this manual and modules contained therein.
•
Each of the Master trainers will facilitate farmers to acquire knowledge and skills in
facilitating Farmer-led Field Schools (FFS) through practical demonstrations.
3.1.2
Up scaling.
•
This will be done by selecting lead farmers (LF) to be trained in facilitation
skills
3.2
Partners and their Roles
The partners envisioned in this training plan are:
1.	 Core Team of the MoALFC Trainers- Trainers drawn from KALRO and
Department of Agriculture facilitate initial training of Master Trainers in the TOTs
course. They also to provide mentorship to Master Trainers during the first year of
lead farmer (LF) trainings. They should also be available in the evaluation of the
first round of LF trainings.
2.	 County Government Department of Agriculture- Master Trainers and their
supervisors who can be referred to as County Coordination Teams (CCT) to take the
role of LF trainers, mentors and coordinators at sub county level. They assist FFS’s
form partnership with stakeholders for sustainability. They should also support LF’s
form their network.
3.	 Lead Farmer Networks-Association of LFs in the counties to take up farmer
trainings and up scaling in the future. Lead farmer networks and groups will conduct
exchange visits to learn best practices in other project implementing Counties.
4.	 Private Sector Service Providers- inputs suppliers, financial and business
development service providers, market players and processors to partner and
support growth of individual or tomato farmer groups. This is so as to evolve into
sustainable social and commercial entities.
3.3
Training Duration
The proposed initial ToT course for farmer trainers that has 15 modules shall take a total
of at least 48 hours of training materials. With a 6-day training plan, it is possible to have

10
6 days training consisting of 6 hours of training and 2 hours of mid-morning and afternoon
tea and lunch breaks per day. Half a day of the first day allocated for official opening and
climate setting. Another half-day of the last day for course evaluation, wrap up and closing
ceremony.
3.4
Logic of Design and Flow of Sessions
The logic of design and flow of each module is that the trainer, paying attention to the
proposed methods and sessions guidelines shall:
i.
Introduce the module.
ii.
Draw out the participants’ expectations.
iii.
Relate participants’ expectations with module objectives or learning outcomes.
iv.
Explore the concept and content, switching to different methods of delivery of the
content (group exercise, brainstorming, excursions, plenary discussions, role plays)
as the session progresses.
v.
Review the module at the end using participatory approaches with one participant
reading a summary message and its application, and
vi.
Distribute the participants’ hand outs.

11
SECTION 4: GUIDELINES TO THE Trainer
4.1
Preparation of the Training Materials
The training materials suggested require adequate preparations and should be available
before the actual training dates. In addition:
i.
The trainers should familiarize themselves and internalize the guidelines provided
by this manual early enough.
ii.
The stationery required should be available within the training institution 3 days
before the training. These include name tags, flash drivers writing materials, paper
punch and medium size box files for participants’ handouts filing.
iii.
Flip charts and good quality felt pens could be used interchangeably with LCD
projections also laser pointers. Each participant will require one felt pen while the
trainers will require two sets of felt pens.
iv.
Visual aids like field equipment and tools should also be arranged in time before the
sessions start.
v.
There should be adequate copies of participants’ handouts (one per participant) to be
distributed at the end of each session or as may be suitable.
vi.
Copies of the modules are distributed at the end of each module.
4.2
Preparation of Training Venue and Sites
The training venue will include the training room, field demonstration sites and sites acting
as markets.
Training Room – should have adequate space for 25 participants seated in a semi-circle or
U shape arrangement, ensuring access and unobstructed view of the front. There should be
adequate space for a desk and seats for three trainers, preferably at the sides or at the back
of the training room. There should also be a desk for the trainer, his /her materials and LCD
projector, a flip chart holder and white wall to act as a projector screen.
Demonstration Site – should be a 5 minutes walking distance with at least 5 distinct tomato
plots for practical during pests, diseases and crop management demonstrations. A   clear seed
bed should also be available for demonstrations on nursery establishment and transplanting
techniques.
Market Sites – these include tomato retail outlets (kiosks, stalls, shops and supermarkets),
whole sale and aggregation points and processing sites if any. The operators should be
informed in advance about the visits. These should not be very far away, preferably less than
10 minutes’ drive distance will do.

12
4.3
The Trainees
The trainees who will participate are service providers and County extension officers with
elaborate training background in agriculture and extension. They all have considerable
experience in training farmers albeit using less facilitative advisory or technology transfer
approaches. The trainer should therefore act more of a trainer than a lecturer and draw out
and build on their knowledge, skills and experience that they shall bring in. As a golden rule,
do not lecture them but facilitate and listen and let them feel like equals to each other and
the CTT team members.
4.4
Training Program
The training program proposed consists of the actual training modules including health
breaks. The training program should preferably be based on the outline presented below
in Table 2 to allow flow of ideas and topics. However, should the situation demand, the
sequence and day of coverage for whole or parts of the modules can be modified to suit
emerging requirements.
The training program presented (Annex 1) assumes that the trainees report on Sunday
evening and leave six days later on Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning.
4.5
Training Methods
The training methods proposed for each session are suitable for adult learners and appropriate
for addressing knowledge, skills and attitudes of the participants. The choice of the methods
has been informed by the competency issues being addressed, time available and experiences
of the author of this manual. The available training methods are presented in Table 2 below.

Arrange training room furniture, place materials, equipment and stationery
on the tables. Arrange for the reception of trainees at residence proposed
On the first
day
Arrange for the reception of trainees at the training venue. Ensure climate
setting is done before the course is officially opened. This includes: (i)
registration, (ii) welcome to the venue by host; (iii) elaborate introduction
of CTT and participants; setting of ground rules; and (iv) formation of
groups.
4.7
Evaluation of the Training
A half-day has been allocated for planning for way forward and evaluation of the ToT
on the last day of the training. This is as shown in the program presented in Section 4.4.
The evaluation strategy should take two directions the first being the individual trainees
completing Evaluation Forms without conferring or refereeing to each other. The forms are
then collected and analyzed by the CTT members.

4.3 Climate-Smart Agricultural policy options
The second direction for evaluation is trainees’ group evaluation. They retreat to one room
and elect a chair and a secretary. Ask them to objectively and constructively evaluate the
training in about 45 minutes in the absence of the CTT members. They then present their
evaluation to the CTT members and as they present, the CTT members should only give
points of clarification if any misunderstanding occurred but should not try to be defensive.
The CTT members then use the two evaluation results to write a report highlighting aspects
that went on well and can be replicated, challenges that were encountered, and opportunities
for future ToTs improvement.
4.8
Participant’s Training Notes and Reference Materials
4.8.1
List of Tomato publications
The list of tomato publications is divided into two. The detailed list of all publications is
summarized in Annex 2:
1.	 Publications for potential new entrants and new tomato farmers who have just
started in the last 6-12 months (to be Labelled A in Table format).
2.	 More advanced level publications which can be understood and used by more
established tomato farmers. (to be Labelled B in Table format).

Tomato Value Chain
15
4.8.2
Guide on the use of the information
The trainers will be advised to issue at most two publications for each of the training
sessions. This is because if they go away with 10 publications, for example, in one visit
they may be overwhelmed with the material load and thus limit knowledge uptake. Also,
some will just take away as many as they can if allowed.
The list of all individual publications will be stored and available as electronic copies –
mainly PDFs. The service providers are strongly advised to keep these electronic copies on
a memory stick, or portable hard drive to enable farmers easily access and if necessary print
any of them out at a local Cyber Café.
Trainers will be advised to issue a General Tomato Farming Manual to be accompanied
by 2 other publications e.g. information sheets, brochures, factsheets, posters, etc. With
subsequent training modules, they can develop their collection of publications.

MODULE 2
FARMER FIELD BUSINESS SCHOOL (FFBS) APPROACH
2.1
Introduction to the Module
This module is designed for training and exposing trainees to Farmer Field and Business
Schools (FFBS) approach and concepts. In addition, practitioners of FFBS need to have
knowledge of this methodology in order to mainstream various TIMPs in tomato enterprise.
The trainees will thereafter facilitate farmers in the CIGs to enable them share and learn by
doing, try available technologies and innovations as they implement them on their farms.
FFBS also empowers the learners with various skills such as leadership, communication
and business. Since the methodology is participatory, it improves the learners’ observation
skills and creates linkages with other value- chain players thereby making tomato enterprise
profitable and sustainable.
2.2
Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module the following outcomes must be achieved:
•
Have a clear understanding of Farmer Field and Business School approach and be

able to differentiate between teaching and facilitating.
•
Be equipped with practical skills that help them feel informed and confident about

their roles and ability to facilitate a participatory learning session.
•
Be empowered with knowledge and analytical skills to facilitate designing simple

experiments to test and select the best solution to their (problem) challenges (TIMPs).
•
Facilitate the shift from the traditional focus to improving productivity towards

farming business proposition.
2.3

MODULE 3
TOMATO NICHES AND SUITABLE VARIETIES
3.1	Introduction to the Module
This module is designed to train trainers of FFBS on tomato production niches and varieties
suitable for cultivation in different AEZs and cultivation systems in the changing climate and
farming environment. Trainers, service providers and lead farmers are exposed to the eco-
climatic requirements (altitudes, soils, AEZs and climatic conditions) suitable for tomato
production in the selected counties. Tomato are fairly adaptable to a wide climatic range but
grow best at 1150 to 1800m above sea level in warm conditions with optimum temperatures
of 15°-25°C. Very low temperatures delay colour formation and ripening while temperatures
above 30°C inhibit fruit set, lycopene content flavour development. Tomato thrive best in
low to medium rainfall with supplementary irrigation during the off-season. Greenhouse
cultivation allows for tomato cultivation across a wide range of AEZs since the microclimate
can be controlled. Tomato grow well in a wide range of soil types, which are high in organic
matter, well-drained and with a pH range of 5-7.5. Tomato cultivation is done in both open
field irrigated system and in greenhouses mainly by smallholder farmers. A wide range
of tomato varieties are available in the market and farmers are faced with the challenge
of deciding on the appropriate varieties to grow in their farms depending on the agro-
ecological zone (AEZ) and the cultivation system practicsed. Determinate varieties are best
suited to open field cultivation while indeterminate varieties are appropriate for greenhouse
cultivation. There is also an emerging market for cherry tomato that farmers in some of the
target counties, such as Mandera and Garissa are focusing on. The varieties differ in terms of
critical attributes such as maturity period, fruit characteristics, yield, tolerance to biotic and
abiotic stresses and marketability.  There is therefore need to impart information on variety
suitability to derive maximum output from tomato production systems.
3.2	Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module section the following outcomes should be achieved:
•
Varieties suited to open field or greenhouse cultivation identified
•
Advice on the attributes of these varieties provided
•
Advice to farmers on source of seed for demanded varieties provided
3.3	Module Target Group and Categories
The target users of both modules are trainers, educators, county extension officers and model
small and medium-scale tomato farmers.
3.4	Module Duration
The module is estimated to take 2 hours.
3.5	Module Users
This module will be used by Master Trainers (TOTs).

MODULE 4
SEEDS / SEEDLINGS PRODUCTION
4.1
Introduction to the Module

This module is intended for use in training of master trainers in order for them to assist
farmers improve production. Clean planting material is a pre-requisite for successful
tomato production. However, use of poor quality seedlings obtained from dubious sources
is a rampant practice. Some farmers also use “own seed”, “Kukamua mbegu”, extracted
from previous crops. This is a risky practice since it not only adversely affects the overall
performance of the succeeding crop, especially if extraction is from hybrid varieties, but
also perpetuates seed borne diseases from one season to the next. The intervention targets
sensitizing farmers on importance of raising seedlings properly on-farm using certified seed
of preferred varieties. Tomato nursery can be established on beds in the open field or under
protection in a greenhouse structure where seedlings can be raised in beds on the ground
or in seedling containers (seedling boxes, trays, pots) filled with growing media (such as
coco peat, pumice, humix and sterilized soil) placed on benches erected in the greenhouse
structure.
4.2
Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module the following outcomes should be achieved:
•
Appropriate seed quality for seedling establishment identified
•
Use of various substrates for seedling production identified
•
Use of various structures for seedling production explained

MODULE 5
AGRONOMIC PRACTICES IN OPEN FIELD TOMATO
CULTIVATION
5.1	Introduction to the Module
This module is designed for Master trainers in proper agronomic practices in open field
tomato cultivation for improved yields. These practices range from site selection, land
preparation, transplanting, fertilizer application, weeding, irrigation, staking, pruning, to
pre-harvesting. Tomato farmers in some cases apply inappropriate agronomic practices
and hence fail to achieve the expected yields. Tomato growing requires good agronomic
practices for optimal yields and increased incomes. Poor site selection, land preparation, low
plant density, irregular watering, lack of pruning and weeds reduce yields. Farmers attribute
the low yields to wrong causal factors for instance poor seed, soil, or “cold weather” for
low tomato yields. At times farmers are unable to visualize the cause and effect relationship
between factors of production and yields. Some aspects affect yields and increase costs
of production but where most cultural activities are carried out as recommended, farmers
achieve high yields. Most cultural and field activities if carried out well can reduce the need
for increased use of agrochemicals thus resulting in reduced environmental degradation,
increased savings and consequently increased incomes.
There is need for capacity building and demonstration of good agronomic practices to
improve open field tomato cultivation. This module aims at importing the learning outcomes
necessary for adoption of these field practices.
5.2	Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module the following outcomes should be o achieved:
•
Agronomic practices in open field tomato identified and explained
•
In-depth knowledge of proper agronomic practices in tomato cultivation provided.
5.3	Module Target Group
The module targets Service Providers and County Public extension staff.
5.4	Module Users
The module users are the Master Trainers (TOTs).
5.5	Module Duration
The module is estimated to take a minimum of 6 hours 50 minutes.

MODULE 6
GREENHOUSE TOMATO CULTIVATION
6.1
Introduction to the Module
Tomato is one of the most important crops in Kenya with high market demand for quality
fruits and their value added products. Tomato production has potential to address food
and nutrition security as well as wealth creation resulting in empowerment. Open field
cultivation which is often practised is hindered by various challenges which can be overcome
using greenhouses. Greenhouse technology has been posed to be a cost-effective solution
to address the issues in tomato cultivation in Kenya. These are key technologies that can
be used to enhance productivity and deal with various production challenges. Greenhouse
tomato farming has the potential of achieving higher yields on the same amount of land,
compared to open-field farming.
The module seeks to address the issues of inappropriate greenhouse designs for specific
climatic zones and lack of skills in greenhouse crop management. It covers technologies and
practices applicable to greenhouse tomato as follows:
•
Improved greenhouses for production of high quality tomato
•
Use of coco-peat for tomato production
•
Use of Styrofoam boxes or plastic flats and raised horizontal planting troughs
•
Nutrition management
•
Staking and pruning
•
Irrigation using drip irrigation and capillary wick methods
•
Bio-degradable mulching materials for weed management and moisture retention.
6.2
Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module, the following outcomes should be achieved:
• Key features of an appropriate greenhouse for tomato production described
• Preparation and use cocopeat for production of tomato demonstrated
• Use styrofoam boxes and raised horizontal planting troughs for tomato production

MODULE 7
INTEGRATED SOIL AND WATER MANAGEMENT
PRACTICES FOR TOMATO PRODUCTION
7.1	 Introduction to the module
The performance of the agriculture sector in Kenya has continued to decline over the years due
to increased soil acidity, mining of nutrients not supplied in the applied fertilizers, lowering
of the soil organic matter content caused by non-use of organic resources. Macronutrients
{nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and Sulphur (S)] and micronutrients {zinc
(Zn), Molybdenum (Mo) and Boron (B)} have been identified as deficient in Kenyan
soils. Additionally, climate change has accelerated the decline of the agricultural sector
performance through limited and unpredictable water supply to crop production systems.
Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) which includes conservation agriculture offers
the best options for improving soil fertility while allowing for climate change adaptation.
Tomato is mostly cultivated by smallholder farmers with minimal inputs. Drought
management technologies to mitigate drought effects in the tomato production are available.
However, farmers have not realized the full benefits due to limited integration of the
developed integrated natural resource management (INRM) and sustainable intensification
practices in their tomato production systems. This module introduces service providers, lead
farmers and trainers to the importance of integrated soil and water management practices for
enhanced tomato production
7.2	Module learning outcomes
By the end of the module, the following training outcomes should be achieved:
1.	 Knowledge on soil composition, the various physical, chemical and biological
properties and what constitutes a healthy soil including soil classification acquired
2.	 Soil and plant tissue sampling for laboratory analysis, interpretation and utilization
of results and also identification of accredited laboratories in Kenya discussed and
understood
3.	 Soil fertility and plant nutrition for increased crop productivity (4R Stewardship that
includes nutrient source and application timing and placement methods and timing)
understood by the participants
4.	 Knowledge on soil health and Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM)
for climate resilient cropping systems (conservation agriculture, cereal legume
intercrops, rotation, organic amendments, manure and composting) acquired
5.	 Knowledge on water harvesting technologies, soil and water management acquired
6.	 Knowledge and skills for identifying temporary or permanent decline of land
productive capacity and provide various solutions to soil degradation imparted and
understood by the participants
7.	 Awareness on the occurrence of problematic soils and their management increased
and understood by the participants

54
8.	 Knowledge and skills on drip irrigation technology and its wide application for
tomato production and income generation explained and demonstrated.
7.3	Module Target Group and Categories
This module is intended for service providers and county public extension agents in the
tomato producing areas.
7.4	Module Users
This module is intended for use by Master Trainers who are members of the Core Team of
Trainers (CTT). The trainer using this module should thoroughly familiarize themselves

MODULE 8
PEST MANAGEMENT IN TOMATO
8.1.
Introduction to the Module
Tomato is widely grown by a large number of smallholder farmers in Kenya as an important
horticultural cash crop. It is either grown for processing or for fresh market. The crop can
either be produced under rain-fed or irrigation in the open field or under faces greenhouse.
However, tomato production a lot of challenges, including incidences of pest infestations.
Tomato is affected by a wide range of pests right from the nursery up to the field. The high
temperatures and humidity that is being experienced in many parts of the country, especially
in the arid and semi-arid areas, creates a conducive environment for faster multiplication
of pests. This is aggravated further by the emerging adverse effects of climate change. In
addition, the pests have very short life cycles in their stages of development from the egg to
adult.  Some pests have the ability to produce over 500 eggs per adult which develop into
full adults within 3-4 days. These high populations of pests are a threat to tomato farming if
control measures are not undertaken. This module is therefore meant to help the ToTs have
an understanding of the different types of pests and their management practices.
8.2.
Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module, the following outcomes must be achieved:
• Insect pests and their economic importance described and appreciated
• Scouting skills on developed
• Different kinds of tomato pests identified
• Ways of controlling different types of tomato pests discussed and appreciated
• Adequate skills on integrated pest management acquired
• Skills to minimize tomato crop damage by pests learnt

MODULE 9
TOMATO DISEASES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT
9.1
Introduction to the Module
Tomato is one of the most important crops in Kenya with high market demand for quality
fruits and their value added products. However, tomato production faces serious challenges
due to numerous pests and pathogens leading to reduced yield, quality, and increased costs
of production.  Heavy use of synthetic chemical pesticides in tomato production is an issue
of major concern in food safety, and is also a risk to human health and pollution of the
environment. To enhance production of high quality tomato, there are several methods
available that can be utilized to control diseases. These include resistant cultivars, biological
control, cultural practices, judicious use of pesticides and manipulation of environmental
conditions. This module describes the major diseases constraining tomato production, their
symptoms and impacts, and control measures.
9.2
Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module, the following outcomes should be achieved:
• Major fungal, bacterial, viral diseases and nematodes of tomato identified.
• Key symptoms for disease diagnosis described.
• Effective field scouting plan for the major tomato diseases designed.
• Effective disease management plan designed and implemented.
• Use and/or sale disease free tomato seed and seedlings discussed and appreciated
• Inappropriate use of synthetic chemical pesticides to enhance quality and safety of
tomato fruit discussed and appreciated.
• Extension/ training program on tomato diseases and their management designed and
implemented.

WEEDS MANAGEMENT IN TOMATO
10.1
Introduction to the Module
Tomato is widely grown by a large number of smallholder farmers in Kenya as an important
horticultural cash crop. It is either grown for processing or for fresh market. The crop can
either be produced under rain -fed or irrigation in the open field or under greenhouse. It is
rich in Vitamin C. However, tomato production has a lot of challenges including occurrence
of weeds. Tomato is a crop whose fields become infested by a wide range of weeds from
the nursery up to the field. Weeds are undesirable plants growing amidst tomato where thy
present competition for growth and development resources needed by the tomato crop i.e.
moisture, nutrients, light and space. Those in the Solanacea family also provide cover for
tomato pests like aphids, whitefly, red spider mites, etc. or act as alternate hosts for diseases
such as bacterial wilt and fungal blights. Some may also cause allelopathic effect (these are
toxins which adversely affect crop growth) while those that grow faster than tomato may
cause elongated internodes hence yield reduction. This module is therefore meant to help the
master trainers have an understanding of the different types of weeds and their management
practices.
10.2
Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module, the following outcomes should be achieved:
• Weeds and their economic importance described
• Different kinds of tomato weeds identified
• Distinct ways of controlling different types of weeds that occur in tomato discussed
and appreciated
• Adequate skills on integrated weeds management (IWM) developed.

MODULE 11
TOMATO HARVESTING AND POST-HARVEST
MANAGEMENT
11.1
Introduction to Module
This module is designed for Master Trainers in skills that are useful in handling tomato during harvesting
and postharvest. Tomato destined for various markets and end use should be harvested at the
appropriate time. This ensures good quality of produce with extended shelf-life. Tomato can
be harvested in either matured green, partially ripe, or ripe state. Many farmers especially
new entrants into the market are not very familiar with the maturity indices for tomato.
In tomato producing areas, farmers engage unskilled labour in harvesting tomato. The
harvesting and packaging containers used by farmers may be inappropriate in some cases.
Tomato are delicate fruits, bulky, highly perishable and easily deteriorate in quality if not
handled properly after harvesting, leading to between 30-50 per cent postharvest losses.
Careful handling of tomato from harvesting upto market ensures maintenance of good
quality. Farmers and other actors at these chain levels do not always follow recommended
practices. This leads to high postharvest losses. There is need to sensitize farmers and other
chain actors on importance of proper harvesting and postharvest handling of tomato and
capacity build them on best practices that include determination of maturity indices, fruit
harvesting technique, appropriate harvesting and holding containers, sorting and grading,
precooling at farm level, packaging, transportation and postharvest diseases management.
11.2
Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module the following outcomes should be achieved:
• The maturity indices for tomato fruits destined for various markets identified
• Quality attributes of tomato that need to be preserved during postharvest handling
identified
• Appropriate harvesting technique and harvesting containers for tomato fruit
explained and demonstrated
• Postharvest practices for tomato from harvesting to marketing explained
• Use of the low cost cooling units (charcoal cooler and zero energy cooler) at farm
level explored and evaluated.

MODULE 12
TOMATO PROCESSING
12.1
Introduction to the Module
This  module is designed for training trainers to get skills that are useful in adding value to tomato after
harvesting. Tomato fruit is highly perishable resulting in high postharvest losses and short
shelf life. Processing of tomato fruits into various products enhances shelf life thus ensuring
availability during off season. Agro-processing adds value to the fruits, this increases their
economic value thus giving better returns to farmer or various value chain actors.
Processing diversifies markets and utilization of tomato. If adequate plans have not been
made for preservation, farmers will dispose-off what they produce immediately after
harvesting reducing incomes and affecting future production plans. There are opportunities
in earning more income through value addition. Expertise and skills in tomato processing
is lacking or information available at grass-roots level is limited. Farmers invest very little
effort in value addition due to a number of reasons. Even where development agencies have
supported value adding activities in tomato, effective marketing strategies are not in place.
The groups do not have the organizational structures to execute value addition strategies
if any exist. It is common to find the producer groups’ executive committee members
marketing processed products during exhibitions, field days and shows instead of engaging
workers on commission to market their produce. Where processing facilities have been
provided by projects or development agents, rarely are marketing plans and operations
and maintenance procedures developed and in place. Majority of value chain actors lack
knowledge in organizational development of value addition processes and also face capacity
and infrastructural constrains. This limits value addition enterprise development and hence
is not sustainable neither can it lead to enterprise growth. There is need for capacity building
to address these challenges and promote tomato processing at cottage industry level as viable
commercial enterprises.
12.2
Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module the following outcomes should be achieved:
•
Quality attributes of tomato that are important for processing identified
•
Processing opportunities in tomato value chain identified and prioritized

MECHANIZATION OF TOMATO PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES
13.1
Introduction to the module
Agricultural mechanization supports in enhancing production, productivity and profitability
in agriculture by achieving timeliness in farm operations. It also comes along with precision in
measurement and placement of inputs, reducing available input losses, increasing utilization
efficiency of costly inputs (seed, chemical, fertilizer, irrigation, water etc.), reducing unit cost
of produce, enhancing profitability and competitiveness in the cost of operation. It also helps
in the conservation of agricultural produce and byproducts from qualitative and quantitative
damages; enables value addition and establishment of agro processing enterprises for
additional income and employment generation. Agricultural mechanization is one of the
important inputs that has potential to revolutionize all round development in the rural Kenya.

TOMATO CROSS CUTTING ISSUES
SUB-MODULE 15.1: AGRICULTURAL INNOVATION PLATFORMS
15.1.1	 Introduction to the Sub-Module
This sub-module exposes the service providers, lead farmers and trainers to an innovation
systems based configuration of stakeholders called the Agricultural Innovation Platform
(AIP). It is an organizational model for stimulating innovation and development and
brings actors together in a way that pools together skills and knowledge used to address
challenges and utilize opportunities. The actors include individuals, private and public sector
organizations, policy makers and other value chain stakeholders and are brought together to
seek a solution to a challenge hindering agricultural productivity within a value chain such
as tomato. The AIP facilitates actors to interact, innovate, learn and change with time as they
seek a solution to the common challenge or compelling agenda. In an innovation platform,
information exchange takes place in an environment where every actor’s contribution is
valued and various benefits accrue to all in a win-win situation.
15.1.2	 Sub-module learning Outcomes
By the end of the module, the following outcomes the trainees’ should be achieved:
1.	 Attributes of an innovation platform described
2.	 Stakeholders mobilization for  initiation  of an AIP demonstrated
3.	 The establishment, management and monitoring of AIPls demonstrated
4.	 Process of building innovation capacity of the actors described
15.1.3	 Sub-module Target Group and Categories
The target users are public county extension officers, private agricultural service providers,
and lead farmers.
15.1.4	 Sub-module Users
This module is intended for use by Master Trainers who are members of the Core Team of
Trainers (CTT). The trainer using this module should thoroughly familiarize themselves
with the participants’ handouts.

SUB-MODULE 15.2
TOMATO GENDER, VULNERABLE AND MARGINALIZED
GROUPS (VMGs), SOCIO, ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
AND COHESION
15.2.1	 Introduction to the Sub-module
Tomato is a major agro-enterprise and therefore all the gender categories [men, women,
youth vulnerable marginalized groups (VMGs)] are involved in its value chain from
production, marketing and consumption. However, women perform most of the tomato
production activities such as planting, weeding and harvesting while men mostly perform
the task of marketing. Despite this huge women’s contribution, gender inequalities exist in
all areas of the value chains. Some of these gender inequalities include: division of labour,
access to and control of resources and decision making within and beyond the household.
These inequalities limit women, youth and VMGs access to and benefits from the various
Technologies Innovations and Management Practices (TIMPs) at different nodes of the value
chain. At the macro-level, effective participation of women and youth in groups and market
activities is constrained by their low decision making power, lack of voice and lack of access
to financial resources. Gender analysis examines the productive and reproductive roles of
men and women; access, control and ownership of resources; levels of power relations;
differential needs, constraints and opportunities; and impact of these differences (positive/
negative) on lives of men, women, youth and the VMGs.
Tomato value chain TIMPs interventions, when designed and implemented with gender
equitable principles, can foster adoption leading to increased productivity as well as

106
enhanced social and environmental impacts. The overall objective of this module is to
ensure that gender mainstreaming and social inclusion in  tomato TIMPs is enhanced by
field agricultural practitioners and extension officers as an effort geared towards achieving
Climate Smart Agriculture “triple win” in target counties.
15.2.2 	 Sub-module learning outcomes
By the end of the sub-module training, the following outcomes should be achieved:
•
Understanding of the concept of gender mainstreaming and social inclusion in
tomato value chain enhanced
•
Appreciation of youth empowerment in tomato value chain increased
•
understanding of women empowerment in tomato value chain increased
•
Inclusion of the strategies for inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized groups in
tomato value chain increased
•
Appreciation of socio-cultural barriers in tomato value chain increased
•
Environmental and social management framework (ESMF) tool explained and
understood.

SUB-MODULE 15.3
CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURAL POLICY OPTIONS
15.3.1
Introduction to the Sub-module
Kenya adopted Vision 2030 in 2007 as a blue print and roadmap for political, social and
economic development of the country in the next two decades. The Vision identifies
Agriculture as the engine of growth through transformation of smallholder and subsistence
agriculture to innovatively and commercially oriented agriculture. Kenya promulgated the
new constitution in 2010 which proposes two levels of governments (national & county)
with defined functions. Agriculture is one of the devolved governance functions. However,
agriculture in Kenya is facing many challenges and threats such as climate change, declining
agricultural performance, limited high potential agricultural land and over-reliance on rain
fed agriculture, limited diversification of agricultural production, poor and inadequate rural
infrastructure, inadequate and declining research in agriculture, reduced agricultural sector
financing and related activities and low technical capacity among the actors. Therefore,
agricultural policy in Kenya revolves around the main goals of increasing productivity and
income growth, especially for smallholders; enhanced food security and equity, emphasis on
irrigation to introduce stability in agricultural output, commercialization and intensification
of production especially among small scale farmers; appropriate and participatory policy
formulation and environmental sustainability. This module introduces the national and
county governments, service providers, lead farmers, trainers and relevant stakeholders
in the design and implementation of effective climate-smart-sensitive agricultural policy
options to promote the transition to climate-smart agriculture at the smallholder level. The
policy context of this module is structured around six topics.
15.3.2 	 Sub-module Learning Outcomes
By the end of this Sub-module training, the following outcomes should be achieved:
•
The role of agricultural policy frameworks in Kenya appreciated
•
Climate-smart agriculture practices, policy options and approaches explored and
explained
•
Climate-smart-sensitive policy cycle explained
•
Implementation of the climate-smart-sensitive policy at the county level explained
and understood
•
Financing and investments for climate-smart agriculture explained
•
The need for a Technology Policy advocated for.
